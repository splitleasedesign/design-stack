      "explanation": "The Craigslist-to-call-to-platform chain is a triple trust handoff. Tag built trust with Bryant (human) but had zero trust in the platform. Gregory assessed legitimacy through conversation, not through platform signals. Works-004 prescribes priming the digital experience from within the human interaction — transcript evidence confirms this is the highest-leverage design intervention: every call that converts a prospect is a manual bridge that the platform should automate through continuity priming."

Deep-read 12+ transcripts in full. Cialdini PDF could not be read directly (pdftoppm not installed), but Layer 1 disappointments.json contains extensive Ch.3-4 framework analysis that was used for cross-referencing. Book Guide (Psychology_Anthropology.md) confirmed chapter structure."
