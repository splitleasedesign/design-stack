      "combined_evidence": "Design-stack evidence (inside-out): Andreas shifts from questioner to advisor at 5:12 ('if they just go there to sleep, I think just a bed') — this unprompted contribution IS the commitment moment. Reverse-benchmark evidence (outside-in): Cialdini Ch.3 identifies four properties of maximally effective commitments — active, public, effortful, internally motivated. The Chinese POW camp research showed written self-disclosure produces the strongest commitments. Six transcript speakers independently express consequences of missing mutual commitment: Michael Spear ('How do I know you're gonna do that?'), Patricia ('scammed twice'), Hemeden ('make sure they're not crazy'). Combined: the advisor moment (works-005) creates commitment through expertise contribution on the HOST side. The mutual pledge (rb-ui-001) creates commitment through personal self-disclosure on BOTH sides.

(2) If the warm palette should remain canonical, re-skin all rb-ui elements to use library tokens before implementation. (3) Replace Inter/DM Sans with Outfit (library sans-serif). The visual LOGIC of the rb-ui elements (hierarchy, spacing, progressive disclosure) is sound regardless of specific tokens. The conflict is brand-level, not structural. This should be escalated to the design team as a product-level decision before any rb-ui element enters development."
