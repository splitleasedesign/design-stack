The Craigslist run identified the trust vacuum in anonymous listings. The Furnished Finder run identified the identical trust vacuum in a branded directory. Both arrive at the same architectural pattern: trust as a timeline of verified events, not a static badge.",
      "combined_strength": "The convergence validates trust compounding as a category-level gap, not a competitor-specific weakness. Whether the starting point is Craigslist (no brand, no identity) or Furnished Finder (strong brand, weak identity verification), the absence of compounding trust data is the same structural failure. This elevates trust compounding from a 'nice to have' to the single most important infrastructure decision in the platform.",
      "design_action": "Merge the two trust ledger specifications into one canonical component. rb-ui-102 provides the timeline node architecture; rb-ui-2201-001 provides the tier system and search integration. The merged component should have: timeline nodes (from 102), tier badges (from 2201-001), and search result integration (from 2201-001). This is the definitive trust component for the library."

The reverse-benchmark Furnished Finder run independently identifies that extensions must live inside the Stays Manager because that is where the guest already is. Two different processes (DS and RB), two different books (Kahneman and Thiel), same conclusion: the Stays Manager is the operating system for mid-term stays, and every lifecycle event (including extensions) must surface there.",
      "combined_strength": "This convergence is the strongest signal in the system for the Stays Manager's architectural importance. The Kahneman lens says: the Stays Manager is where System 1 already has an established context (associative coherence). The Thiel lens says: the Stays Manager is where proprietary technology creates stored value and switching costs. Both frameworks independently validate the same product decision.",
      "design_action": "The Extension Flow Card (rb-ui-2201-002) should be designed as a native Stays Manager module, not a standalone component.

The Craigslist run built a Structured Proposal Composer (form-based proposal with lifecycle states). The Furnished Finder run builds a Smart Agreement Builder (pre-filled agreement with editable terms). These are two halves of the same system: the proposal initiates the relationship, the agreement formalizes it. Together they form the complete transaction layer that both Craigslist and FF lack.",
      "combined_strength": "Thiel's PayPal analogy applies to both: controlling the transaction layer is more valuable than controlling the listing layer. The Craigslist run validated this from the 'no structure at all' end. The FF run validates it from the 'structure exists but is off-platform' end. The convergence proves that the transaction layer gap is universal across the category, regardless of how much or how little structure the competitor provides.",
      "design_action": "Design the Proposal Composer (rb-ui-103) and Agreement Builder (rb-ui-2201-003) as a unified flow: proposal submission generates an agreement draft automatically. The guest submits a proposal; the system generates a pre-filled agreement; the host reviews proposal + agreement together; both sign. This eliminates the gap between 'proposal accepted' and 'agreement signed' that currently exists in the platform."

The reverse-benchmark run implements this principle in a concrete UI component. The Trust Ledger Profile Card shows verification badges, completed stays, and response metrics (mechanism) before any qualitative claim ('Trusted Host' tier). This is the principle-to-implementation pipeline working correctly.",

This is the same System 1/System 2 optimization: endorsing a suggestion (System 1) is effortless; building a response (System 2) is exhausting.",
      "combined_strength": "Kahneman explains the mechanism (System 1 endorsement vs. System 2 construction). Thiel explains the market failure (FF chose not to build agreement infrastructure because their model does not require it). The combined insight: the agreement builder is not just a UX improvement -- it is a structural competitive advantage that FF's business model prevents them from copying.",
      "design_action": "The Smart Agreement Builder must never present a blank form. Every field must have a smart default derived from: property type, stay duration, state law, and both parties' profiles. The 'edit' action modifies a complete package; the 'construct' action never appears."

    {
      "priority": 1,
      "recommendation": "Run a reverse-benchmark against Airbnb Monthly using Ben Horowitz's 'The Hard Thing About Hard Things' or a comparable operations-focused book",
      "rationale": "Airbnb Monthly is the closest direct competitor for mid-term stays, but no RB run has analyzed their monthly stay experience specifically (the existing Airbnb run focused on Cialdini's persuasion frameworks for general stays). The operational challenges of mid-term hosting (maintenance, cleaning schedules, utility management) are under-explored. An operations-focused book lens would surface the 'hard things' that SL must solve to make the Stay Operating System viable.",
      "expected_elements": "Maintenance request workflows, cleaning coordination tools, utility transparency dashboards, host operations hub"
    },
    {
      "priority": 2,
      "recommendation": "Run a design-stack pipeline using a guest call transcript focused on the proposal-to-move-in journey",
      "rationale": "The library has strong coverage of discovery-through-proposal (guest-side) and strong coverage of active-stay (both sides). The gap is the proposal-to-move-in transition: what happens after a guest's proposal is accepted but before they physically arrive? This is the anxiety peak for guests and the preparation peak for hosts. No existing run specifically targets this phase.",
      "expected_elements": "Pre-arrival checklist, move-in day orchestration, first-night comfort features, host-guest icebreaker prompts"
    },
    {
      "priority": 3,
      "recommendation": "Run a reverse-benchmark against a non-housing platform (e.g., Stripe, Plaid, or another financial infrastructure platform) using a fintech-focused book",
      "rationale": "Multiple runs identify the financial infrastructure gap (payment processing, deposit escrow, guarantee mechanisms). No run has analyzed this from a financial infrastructure lens. The agreement builder (rb-ui-2201-003) handles the UX but not the underlying financial architecture. A fintech-focused RB run would surface the payment rails, escrow mechanisms, and insurance products that make the agreement builder's promises enforceable.",
      "expected_elements": "Payment dashboard, deposit escrow tracker, insurance integration, financial health signals"
    },
    {
      "priority": 4,
      "recommendation": "Conduct a host-side design-stack run using Jessica Filomeno's call transcript",
      "rationale": "Jessica represents the most trust-resistant host archetype in the transcript corpus. She demanded a confidentiality agreement before sharing property information. A DS run using her call would stress-test the trust architecture from the hardest case: if the Trust Ledger and Agreement Builder can satisfy Jessica, they can satisfy anyone.",
      "expected_elements": "Maximum-security trust displays, confidentiality-forward agreement terms, institutional host onboarding flow"
