      "problem": "When a host transitions from one phase to the next, the platform opens with NEW information: a blank form, an unfamiliar dashboard, an unseen notification. Kahneman's associative coherence principle predicts that System 1 evaluates new contexts by searching for familiar anchors. If the first thing the eye hits is unfamiliar, System 1 flags the context as 'unknown territory' and the host's System 2 must mobilize to determine whether to proceed. This costs cognitive resources and risks abandonment. Andreas described his two units in 7 seconds (1:03-1:10) because he was drawing from known information. The platform should open every screen the same way: with what the host already told us, already completed, or already knows to be true. Recognition is effortless; comprehension of new material is effortful. The information architecture must lead with recognition.",
      "solution": "Every screen's primary information element must be a reflection of what the host has already provided or already established. On the onboarding screen after the call, the primary element is: the agent's name, the property address, and the tenants discussed. On the listing wizard, Step 2 opens with a summary of Step 1's completed data before presenting new fields. On the proposal management screen, the primary element is the host's own listing details and the tenant names they already know. New information is always secondary or tertiary. The pattern is: mirror first, then extend. The host sees themselves in the screen before the screen asks anything of them.",

The platform's current pricing model presents nightly rates, 4-week rent totals, price per night, and total reservation prices simultaneously. This forces the host to perform format translation (monthly to nightly) while also evaluating whether the numbers are correct. Kahneman's bat-and-ball problem demonstrates that over 50% of elite university students fail simple arithmetic when an intuitive but wrong answer is available. A host confronting unfamiliar pricing formats during a depleting multi-step process will either accept wrong numbers or abandon the process entirely.",

  "methodology_notes": "Seven information architecture elements extracted from the intersection of Andreas's call behavior patterns and Kahneman's System 1/System 2 framework. Each element specifies HOW information should be structured (hierarchy), WHEN it should be revealed (disclosure), HOW MUCH the host can process (cognitive load), and WHAT THE EYE HITS FIRST (scan order). Elements are ordered from most universally applicable (communicates-001: anchor-then-advance applies to every screen) to most phase-specific (communicates-007: advisor prompt applies to specific moments within phases). Every element traces directly to observable behavior in the Andreas call and to specific cognitive mechanisms documented in Kahneman. No element specifies visual design, layout, or interaction patterns -- those belong to subsequent layers."
