      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Andreas discovered Split Lease because Bryant found his Craigslist listing and reached out to him (andreas-call.txt, 0:50: 'Craigslist is where I found the Washington Heights apartment'). The host did NOT discover Split Lease; Split Lease discovered the host. This inverts the typical discovery model. Kahneman's System 1 framework reveals why this matters: when a host encounters an unsolicited outreach message, System 1 immediately performs a threat/opportunity assessment. The outreach must pass the automatic 'is this a scam or an opportunity?' filter before System 2 engages to read the details. Andreas's willingness to engage (he texted Bryant back, referenced at 0:15: 'I texted you about the Washington Heights') indicates his System 1 classified the outreach as a plausible opportunity rather than spam. The critical System 1 signals that likely enabled this: Bryant contacted him about a SPECIFIC property (his listing), not a generic pitch. Kahneman's concept of associative coherence (kahneman-part1-two-systems.txt, 'The Associative Machine') explains why specificity matters: mentioning the host's own property activates a coherent network of associations (my listing, my income, my vacancy problem) that frames the outreach as relevant rather than random.",

This micro-commitment indicates his System 1 impression was positive enough to warrant a response.

The call structure reveals that evaluation is not a single decision but a cascade of micro-evaluations, each of which must pass before the host continues. Andreas asks about furnishing (1:29), hears the answer, then moves to deposits (3:02), then broker's fee (3:16), then payment process (3:28-3:51), and finally logistics (5:27-5:54).

The onboarding is entirely human-mediated (Bryant will 'send over some information' and 'reach out shortly after the call,' 6:03-6:11). Kahneman's framework reveals why this matters: the phone call created a state of cognitive ease and associative coherence (smooth conversation, clear answers, growing trust). Transitioning to a digital platform introduces what Kahneman calls a 'conflict between an automatic reaction and an intention to control it' (kahneman-part1-two-systems.txt, Conflict section).
