      "problem": "When the host transitions from Bryant's phone call to the platform, the visual environment undergoes a complete change. The phone call had no visual identity; the platform has colors, typography, layout, and imagery that the host has never seen. Kahneman's System 1 processes these visual elements instantly, before the host reads a single word. If the visual environment signals 'corporate software' or 'unfamiliar website,' System 1 flags the context as foreign and the trust built during the call is not transferred. Andreas never mentioned a platform (5:27-6:11); his expectation is a continuation of a personal, warm interaction with Bryant. The visual palette must communicate warmth, calm competence, and personal attention within the first 2 seconds of page load, before any content is processed. A cold, stark, or overly branded visual environment will trigger a System 1 reassessment that forces the host to re-evaluate whether this is the same trustworthy entity they spoke with on the phone.",
      "solution": "The platform's visual foundation uses warm off-white backgrounds (bg #f6f4f0) with white surface cards (surface #ffffff) as the primary canvas. No stark white full-page backgrounds. No dark mode. No saturated color fields. The warmth of the base palette creates the same tonal register as a comfortable, professional conversation: calm, grounded, not clinical. Every page the host sees should feel like opening a well-organized document from someone they trust, not like entering a software application. The warm neutrals serve as the System 1 trust signal: before the host reads any text, the color temperature tells them 'this is a warm, personal space' rather than 'this is a corporate tool.' The accent color (forest green #2d5a3d) appears sparingly and only on interactive or trust-signaling elements, never as a background fill. The result is a visual field where the background recedes and the content advances, matching the phone call pattern where Bryant's personality was foreground and the company was background.",

      "problem": "The host encounters three distinct types of information on every screen: familiar anchor content (their property name, agent's name, tenant names), action content (instructions, field labels, buttons), and verifiable data (credit status, payment amounts, dates). Kahneman's two-system framework shows that these three types engage different cognitive modes: anchors are processed by System 1 (recognition, automatic), actions require System 1-to-System 2 bridging (comprehension, moderate effort), and verifiable data engages System 2 (deliberate evaluation). Using a single typeface for all three creates visual monotony that forces the host to read everything with equal attention, violating Kahneman's law of least effort. The visual typography must signal to the host's System 1 which content can be scanned automatically and which content requires deliberation, before a single word is read. Andreas's call behavior shows this pattern: he processed familiar information (his own property details at 1:03-1:10) effortlessly, processed action information (showing schedule at 1:18) at moderate speed, and processed verifiable data (pricing at 3:02-3:16) with focused attention. The typography must guide the eye through this same hierarchy.",
      "solution": "Three typefaces serve three distinct cognitive functions, used consistently across every screen: (1) Instrument Serif for anchor content that the host should recognize instantly: property names, agent names, tenant names, section headlines. The serif face carries personality and warmth, signaling 'this is personal, this is yours.' System 1 processes serif headlines as identity markers, not as information to be decoded. (2) Outfit (sans-serif) for all action content: instructions, field labels, button text, navigation, descriptions. The sans face is clean and direct, matching the conversational clarity of Bryant's explanations. System 1 processes sans-serif body text as 'here is what to do' without additional interpretation. (3) IBM Plex Mono for all verifiable data: payment amounts, credit scores, dates, status codes, financial summaries. The mono face signals precision and invites System 2 verification. When the host sees monospace text, their eye knows to slow down and check. This typographic triad creates a visual scanning language that works before the host reads the actual words.",

Kahneman's bat-and-ball problem shows that when multiple numbers are present, System 1 latches onto the most visually prominent one and may generate a wrong interpretation. If the nightly rate ($80) is as visually prominent as the monthly total ($2,400), the host may anchor on the smaller number and feel that the platform undervalues their property.

He states his own verifiable standard: 'excellent credit on every single tenant' (4:06). When these trust signals appear on the platform, they must be instantly distinguishable from regular content. If trust signals blend visually with general text, the host must read and evaluate each piece of text to find the verification evidence, which costs System 2 resources. Kahneman's cognitive fluency research shows that information presented in a visually distinct, easy-to-process format is perceived as more trustworthy. A dedicated visual treatment for trust information creates a Pavlovian signal: when the host sees this specific color-and-type combination, they know without reading that the content is verified, checked, or guaranteed. This reduces the cognitive cost of trust evaluation from 'read and analyze' to 'see and know.'",

Trust badges follow a consistent visual pattern: accent-light (#e8f0eb) background pill with accent (#2d5a3d) text in IBM Plex Mono at 12-13px, weight 500. Examples: 'Credit Verified,' 'Payment Secured,' 'Pre-Authorized.' The green-on-light-green combination is the platform's visual shorthand for 'this has been verified by the system.' By reserving the accent color exclusively for trust, every other screen element becomes neutral background. The host's eye is trained to scan for green: where green appears, verification exists.

The visual challenge is how to represent content that exists but is not the primary focus. If secondary content is completely hidden, the host may not know it exists, leading to missed information. If secondary content is fully visible, it creates the visual clutter that overloads System 2. Kahneman's law of least effort predicts that hosts scan only the visually easiest content. Andreas demonstrates this in the call: he processes primary information (units, pricing) actively but secondary information (furnishing companies, rental agreement details) only when Bryant brings it up. The visual design must make secondary content present-but-subordinate: visible enough that the host knows it exists, muted enough that System 1 does not flag it as requiring attention.",

(3) Tertiary content (on-demand) uses ink-muted (#8a857e) at the smallest acceptable size, often with an expand trigger ('View details,' 'Show breakdown'). The host knows the content exists because the trigger is visible, but the content itself does not occupy visual space until requested. The three tiers create a visual depth effect: primary content is in sharp focus, secondary content is slightly receded, tertiary content is at the edge of the visual field.

On the platform, the host submits information into form fields, toggles features, and confirms proposals.

This phase uses no easing -- it is instantaneous, mimicking Bryant's 'Yep.'

      "visual_hierarchy_rule": "Motion is subordinate to content. No animation should draw more visual attention than the content it reveals or confirms. The test: if a host records the screen and reviews it, the motion should be barely noticeable in playback. What should be noticeable is the state change (toggle switched, card appeared, progress advanced). The motion serves the state change; the state change serves the content; the content serves the host.",
      "brand_alignment": "Directly implements the taste model's animation philosophy: 'Fast response, gentle settle. User actions feel instant (<100ms acknowledgment) but transitions are smooth (300-500ms)' and 'Never bounce. Spring easing for interactive elements, ease-out for transitions. One signature animation per component -- restraint over spectacle.' The spring easing is explicitly reserved for celebration moments, preventing overuse that would dilute its significance."

  "production_tension_note": "The current production code uses a purple-dominant palette (primary-purple #31135D, secondary-purple rgb(109,49,194)) and Inter + DM Sans fonts. The visual patterns in this layer reference the taste model's target direction: warm neutrals with forest green accent, and Instrument Serif + Outfit + IBM Plex Mono typography. The transition from purple to green, and from Inter/DM Sans to the taste model triad, is a strategic direction change. These visual patterns define the target state, not the current state. Implementation should plan for a gradual palette and typography migration.",
  "methodology_notes": "Seven visual pattern elements extracted from the intersection of Andreas's call behavior and Kahneman's System 1 visual processing research. Each element defines a reusable visual principle (not a mockup) that references specific design tokens. The elements are organized from broadest application (looks-001: warm surface affects every screen) to most specific (looks-007: motion timing for interactive elements). Every element includes WCAG contrast verification against the actual token values. Three high-priority elements address the critical visual trust transfer (warm surface, typographic trust triad, agent identity). Two high-priority elements address the financial and verification visual language (single-number focal point, green trust badges). Two medium-priority elements address visual rhythm and motion (progressive disclosure weight, motion as confirmation). Nine new tokens are proposed, all derived from specific behavioral or cognitive requirements documented in the evidence."
