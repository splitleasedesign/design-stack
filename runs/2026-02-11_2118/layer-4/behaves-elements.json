      "problem": "In the phone call, Bryant acknowledges every piece of information Andreas provides within a fraction of a second: 'Yep' (1:10), 'Got it' (3:16), 'Yup' (4:26), 'Okay' (3:02). These micro-acknowledgments serve a critical cognitive function: they release the host's working memory from holding the just-provided input while waiting to confirm receipt. On the platform, form fields, toggles, and buttons offer no equivalent signal. The host enters data into a field and sees nothing happen. Their System 2 must hold the input in working memory ('Did it register? Should I click again? Is it saving?') until a visible state change occurs. Kahneman's attention research shows that maintaining items in working memory competes with the same limited resource pool used for decision-making. Every second of 'did that work?' uncertainty depletes the resource the host needs for their next decision. The result is a compounding tax: each unacknowledged input makes the next input slightly harder, accelerating the depletion gradient across the session.",
      "solution": "Every interactive element on the platform provides an immediate state change within 100ms of the host's action, before any server response or validation occurs. This is the platform's 'Yep.' The acknowledgment is purely visual and local -- it does not depend on network latency, data processing, or backend confirmation. It says 'I heard you' and nothing else. For text fields: the border shifts to accent green (#2d5a3d) on focus, confirming the system is listening. For toggles and chips: the selected state renders instantly (0ms CSS transition), with the easing-out settle animation (350ms, cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)) applied to any resulting layout change. For buttons: a 1px translate-y depress on press, with the action result (navigation, modal, save) following within the settle window. For multi-step wizards: a progress indicator advances immediately when the host completes a step, before the next step's content loads. The principle is: local acknowledgment is instant; remote confirmation can follow at network speed. The host never waits for the server to feel heard.",

Each topic is raised, addressed, and resolved before the next one begins. No topic is revisited, and no two topics compete for attention simultaneously. This is not accidental -- it is the natural structure of a conversation optimized for a depleted System 2. Kahneman's research on ego depletion shows that making a series of choices that involve conflict is a known depletor of self-control. When a platform presents multiple unrelated input fields simultaneously (as a traditional form does), each field represents a micro-decision that competes with every other field for the host's depleted attention. The host must decide not just WHAT to enter, but WHICH field to enter first, WHICH can be skipped, and WHETHER the fields are related. These meta-decisions about the form itself consume the same cognitive resources as the actual decisions within the form.",
      "solution": "The platform presents input fields and decision points one at a time or in tightly grouped clusters of 2-3 related fields, following the natural information sequence that emerged in the phone call. Each cluster is revealed only after the prior cluster is completed and acknowledged. The reveal uses the settle animation (350ms, easing-out) to draw the eye smoothly to the next input. The sequence mirrors the call's topic order where applicable: identity and location first (who/where), features second (what it has), terms third (pricing and rules), logistics fourth (scheduling, photos). Within each cluster, fields are visually grouped on a single card or section, with no scrolling required to see all fields in the cluster. The host's experience is: answer this, see the next thing, answer that. Never: here are 12 fields, figure out the order yourself.",

The cognitive cost of re-engaging with a form from the beginning -- re-reading completed fields, re-making resolved decisions, re-orienting to the sequence -- is higher than the cost of the original engagement, because the host must now reconcile their memory of prior inputs with the platform's state.

Kahneman's associative machine explains why: when the host advises, System 1 constructs a narrative where the host is part of the outcome, creating forward momentum that makes disengagement feel inconsistent. The platform's current forms treat the host exclusively as a data provider: enter your address, select your features, set your price. Data provision is System 2 work (deliberate, effortful, depleting). Advising is System 1 work (pattern-matching from experience, effortless, energizing).

This mirrors Bryant's validation of Andreas's credit standard at 4:26 ('Yup. And we require that'), which preceded the advisor shift. (2) Question: a single, experience-based question that only someone who knows the property could answer ('What should tenants know about living here?' or 'Any tips for making this space feel like home?'). The question must be genuinely useful -- the answer becomes part of the listing or tenant guide. (3) Open response: a simple text field with no character limit, no formatting requirements, and an optional skip button.

      "solution": "After the host completes their first listing, the platform offers a 'Add another unit in this building' action that creates a duplicate listing with all shared attributes pre-filled: address, building amenities, common rules, pricing structure, agent assignment. The host then modifies only what differs: floor, specific unit features, photos. The modification flow uses the same sequential disclosure pattern (behaves-002) but with most clusters pre-filled and auto-collapsed. Only differing clusters are expanded for input. The estimated time for the second listing should be under 2 minutes, compared to 5 minutes for the first. For portfolio management, the dashboard groups listings by building, displaying them as a unit cluster rather than independent cards. Batch operations are available: update pricing for all units, apply a rule change across units, accept proposals for multiple units from the same tenant group.",

The prompt is pre-filled with the building address and shared attributes. A 'Do this later' option is equally visible -- the host is invited, not pushed.",
        "loading": "When the duplicate listing is being generated, the host sees a brief animation: the first listing's summary card multiplies into two cards (350ms settle), with the second card highlighting the fields that need the host's input. This animation communicates 'we copied everything; here is what is different.'",
        "empty": "For the single-unit host who has no other units, this pattern is invisible. No 'Add another unit' prompt appears. The pattern activates only when the host has indicated multiple units (from call data or by self-reporting during listing creation).",
        "error": "If the duplication process fails (server error), the host is offered two options: 'Retry the copy' or 'Start a new listing from scratch.' The pre-filled data from the first listing is preserved in the retry path. The host never loses their existing listing data due to a duplication error.",

The host's mental model is 'I have a building with units,' not 'I have independent listings.' The visual and interaction design should reflect the building-first, unit-second hierarchy. Creating the second unit feels like filling in a detail on the building, not starting a new process.",

        "rationale": "Sub-1-second duplication is achievable because it is a data copy operation, not a creation flow. The spring easing on the card duplication is justified because creating a second listing is a significant portfolio event -- the host's investment in the platform just doubled.

        "Host has more than 2 units: the pattern scales. After the second listing, the 'Add another unit' flow becomes even more streamlined: the host selects which existing listing to duplicate from, then modifies only the differences. Ten units should take proportionally less effort than 2x the first listing.",
        "Units have significantly different characteristics (e.g., one furnished, one unfurnished): the modification flow highlights the differing attributes and asks the host to confirm or change each one. Pre-filled values from the first listing are clearly marked as 'Copied from Unit 1 -- change if different.'",
        "Host wants to apply a change to all units at once (e.g., price increase): batch editing from the building portfolio view applies the change across all selected units with a confirmation preview showing the before/after for each unit. The host reviews the batch, not individual units."
