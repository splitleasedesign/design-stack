      "problem": "Every phase transition in the host journey requires the host to enter a new context: a new screen, a new interaction mode, a new set of decisions. Each transition triggers an automatic System 1 assessment that determines whether the host's System 2 will engage at all. If System 1 flags the new context as unfamiliar, suspicious, or incoherent with the prior phase, the host abandons before deliberate evaluation begins. The platform currently has no mechanism to ensure System 1 approval at these transitions. The result is that hosts who successfully completed the prior phase still drop off at the next one, not because the content is wrong, but because the first impression of the new context fails the automatic legitimacy check.",
      "solution": "Design every phase transition to pass System 1's automatic assessment before demanding System 2 engagement. This means: (1) The first 2 seconds of every new screen or interaction must signal continuity with the prior phase through visual consistency, familiar language, and explicit connection to what just happened. (2) Each transition should open with recognition, not instruction. Show the host what they already provided or accomplished before asking for new input. (3) Remove any element that would trigger System 1 threat detection: unexpected terminology, unfamiliar UI patterns, demands for information that feel premature. (4) Use the same vocabulary the host heard in the phone call or prior interaction. If Bryant said 'roommates who need a space during the week,' the platform should echo that language, not substitute 'periodic tenancy lease style.' The pattern is: anchor first, then advance.",

Each phase consumes System 2 resources: the evaluation call requires active listening and mental math (deposit + broker fee + first month = 3 months), onboarding requires navigating a new platform, listing creation demands 6 steps of decisions, and pricing requires format translation. Kahneman's ego depletion research shows that after exerting self-control in one task, people are less willing and less able to exert it in the next. The parole judge study demonstrates that depleted decision-makers default to denial. In the host journey, the equivalent of denial is abandonment or accepting bad defaults. The current design treats each phase as though the user arrives fresh. They do not. They arrive depleted from the prior phase.",
      "solution": "Design every phase after the first under the assumption that the user's System 2 is partially depleted. This means: (1) Reduce the number of decisions per phase. Each decision consumes from the same depleted pool. Combine, eliminate, or defer any decision that is not essential to completing the current phase. (2) Provide smart defaults that produce good outcomes when accepted without deliberation. The parole judge analogy: if the default is denial, depleted judges deny. If the default is approval with safeguards, depleted judges approve with safeguards. Make the default the right answer. (3) Allow saving and resuming. A depleted host who leaves should be able to return to exactly where they stopped, not restart the phase. (4) Front-load the hardest decisions in the journey when the host is least depleted, and place the easiest decisions last. (5) After any high-effort phase, insert a decompression moment: a confirmation screen, a summary of progress, a small reward signal. This is the digital equivalent of the parole judges' meal break.",

Andreas described two units in 7 seconds (1:03-1:10), asked about furnishing in one sentence (1:29), and processed the 3-month upfront cost in a single exchange (3:02-3:16). The platform, by contrast, requires navigation, form-filling, dropdown selection, and multi-step wizards. This creates a speed mismatch: the call felt fast and efficient, the platform feels slow and laborious. When the platform demands more effort for the same outcome the call achieved easily, the host perceives the platform as inferior to the human interaction. This perception, once formed by System 1, is difficult to override.",

This means: (1) Information that the host conveyed in natural speech during the call (two units, 5th floor, 2nd floor, unfurnished, laundry in building) should be capturable with equivalent speed on the platform. If the host can say it in 7 seconds, they should be able to enter it in under 15 seconds. (2) Use input patterns that mirror conversational flow: structured but not rigid. Quick-select chips, toggle switches, and pre-populated suggestions are faster than dropdown menus and text fields. (3) Provide immediate feedback after each input, mirroring how Bryant acknowledged each point in the conversation ('Yep. Got it.').

      "problem": "The host thinks in one vocabulary and the platform operates in another. Andreas thinks in monthly rent, first-month deposits, and broker fees (3:02-3:16). The platform thinks in nightly rates, 4-week rent totals, and lease styles. Andreas describes his units as '5th floor walk-up' and '2nd floor walk-up' (1:03-1:10). The platform categorizes by space type, bedroom count, and feature lists. This vocabulary mismatch forces the host's System 2 to perform translation at every input point: converting their mental model into the platform's data model. Kahneman's bat-and-ball problem shows that even simple translations fail when an intuitive but wrong answer is available. Hosts who enter a monthly rent figure when the platform expects a nightly rate will create listings with prices that are 30x too high. The cognitive cost of translation compounds across every field in the listing wizard and every line item in the proposal view, creating cumulative depletion.",
      "solution": "The platform must perform the translation, not the host. This means: (1) Accept input in the host's native format and translate internally. If the host thinks in monthly rent, let them enter monthly rent. The platform converts to nightly rate behind the scenes and shows both: 'You entered $2,400/month. That is approximately $80/night.' (2) Use labels that match the host's vocabulary, with platform terminology as secondary annotation. Say 'Monthly Rent' as the primary label, with '(Nightly Rate: $80)' as a subtitle. (3) In proposal management, show financial summaries in the format the host uses. Andreas thinks in total upfront cost (3 months = first + deposit + broker). Show 'Total upfront: $7,200' as the headline, with the itemized breakdown below. (4) Never ask the host to select from categories they do not use. If 'lease style' is a platform concept the host has never encountered, do not present it as a choice. Infer it from the host's natural description of how they want to rent the space.",

Each element targets a specific cognitive mechanism (trust gating, ego depletion, conversational speed matching, priming transfer, commitment through advisory, vocabulary translation) and prescribes a process-level solution applicable across multiple journey phases. Elements are ordered by priority: the first four are high-priority because they address the highest-risk transitions (phase boundaries, human-to-digital handoff, depletion cascades, speed mismatch). Elements 5 and 6 address medium-priority commitment and accuracy patterns."
