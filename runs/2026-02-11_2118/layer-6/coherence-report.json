However, looks-007 describes the accept button using accent green, and behaves-003 specifies a 'full-width button in accent green (#2d5a3d)' for proposal acceptance. The tension is: if green is reserved for 'verified/trust' signals AND used for primary action buttons, the semantic exclusivity of green (green = verified) is diluted.
