      "problem": "When Andreas first encounters Split Lease -- through a text, then a call, then eventually a platform -- his System 1 performs an instantaneous emotional assessment before any facts are processed. Kahneman demonstrates that cognitive ease (information that flows smoothly, looks familiar, feels fluent) generates positive feelings that System 1 interprets as truth and safety. Cognitive strain (unfamiliar terms, visual clutter, unexpected structure) generates negative feelings interpreted as suspicion. The host's first emotional impression at each phase transition is NOT a reaction to the content -- it is a reaction to the fluency of the presentation. A warm, simple, recognizable first impression feels true. A complex, unfamiliar, demanding first impression feels suspicious. This emotional verdict is rendered in under 2 seconds, before any rational evaluation begins, and it biases every subsequent judgment. If the platform's first impression generates cognitive strain, no amount of good content recovers the lost trust.",
      "solution": "Every phase transition must be engineered for maximum cognitive ease in the first 2 seconds. This means: the host's first sensory input at each new context must be something they already know (their property address, their agent's name, a term from the call). The visual temperature must be warm, not clinical. The information density must be low -- one recognizable anchor, not a dashboard of options. The emotional target is the feeling Andreas had at 0:09 of the call: calm, open, ready to engage. Not excited, not worried, not overwhelmed. Just... easy. Cognitive ease is the soil in which trust grows. Without it, nothing else the platform does matters.",

His System 1 has already assessed Bryant's text outreach as legitimate because it referenced his specific property.

By 1:03, Andreas is volunteering property details without hesitation, a behavior only possible when System 1 has rendered a positive first impression."

The platform's listing wizard, by contrast, demands sprint-level effort: 6 steps, dozens of decisions, unfamiliar vocabulary, format translations, and no rest breaks. Kahneman's ego depletion research -- the parole judge study where approval rates drop from 65% to near zero as the judges tire -- predicts exactly what happens: by Step 4 of the wizard, the host is depleted, defaults are accepted blindly, and by Step 6 the host either abandons or produces a low-quality listing. The emotional experience of the host is one of mounting pressure: each step feels harder than the last, not because it IS harder, but because the host has less cognitive energy to bring. The platform does not acknowledge this depletion curve, and it does not provide the emotional equivalent of the judges' meal break.",

The emotional design of decompression moments is critical -- they must feel like a reward for progress, not a delay before more work. The host should feel at each decompression: 'I have done well, and the remaining work is easy.'

Kahneman's associative coherence principle states that emotional associations transfer from one context to another -- if Split Lease feels warm in the call, it should feel warm on the platform. If the two experiences are emotionally incoherent (warm call, cold platform), System 1 flags the inconsistency and generates suspicion. This is not about visual consistency (that is Layer 3's domain). This is about EMOTIONAL consistency: the tone, the warmth, the feeling of being dealt with by a competent, caring human. Every platform touchpoint is evaluated emotionally against the baseline set by the phone call. The call is the emotional tuning fork. Everything that comes after must vibrate at the same frequency.",

The register must remain consistent across channels: the email from Bryant should feel like the call with Bryant, which should feel like the platform where Bryant's photo and name appear. Kahneman's priming research shows that emotional associations cascade: the warm feeling from the call primes warmth-expectations for the email, which primes warmth-expectations for the platform.

The depleted host may accept it, but they feel diminished -- like the platform is doing their job for them.",

Pre-fill announcements disrupt this self-concept by highlighting that the platform made the decision.

Telling the host that the platform already decided undermines the self-concept that System 2 protects."

      "problem": "Andreas's entire evaluation of Split Lease is conducted through conversation with a person (Bryant), not interaction with a platform. His trust, his engagement, his commitment -- all built on human connection. The phone call's emotional texture is entirely interpersonal: Andreas and Bryant establish rapport, trade practical knowledge, and close with personal promises. When this host encounters the digital platform, there is a profound emotional risk: the feeling of being alone. Every other moment in the host journey so far has involved a human. The platform is the first moment where the host operates without one. Kahneman's research on the psychopath example illustrates this: the therapist teacher warns that the FEELING of connection can be a cognitive illusion, but also that the feeling of connection is essential for engagement. The host does not need to speak with Bryant at every step. But they must always FEEL that Bryant is one tap away.",
      "solution": "The agent's presence persists across the platform as a psychological safety net, not as an active participant. The agent photo and name are always visible. A 'Message Bryant' action is always within 2 taps from any screen. When the host encounters confusion, frustration, or uncertainty, the escape path is human, not FAQ. The emotional design is: the platform is the primary tool, but the person is always there. This is the difference between working alone in an office (lonely) and working in an office where a trusted colleague is at the next desk (confident). The colleague does not need to help constantly. Their presence IS the help. The host should never feel: 'I am alone with this software.' They should feel: 'Bryant set this up for me, and I can reach out any time.'",

The human channel is not a fallback -- it is the emotional foundation upon which the platform is built."

The inverse applies here: the host's feeling of connection to Bryant is genuine AND real, but the platform risks creating the cognitive illusion of connection through mere visual presence (photo, name) without the reality. The solution: make the connection real. The 'Message Bryant' action must reach an actual person. The photo must be of the actual agent. The trust is real or it is nothing."

Elements are organized from most foundational (feels-001: cognitive ease, the soil in which all other emotions grow) through the emotional arc of the journey (feels-002 relief, feels-003 advisor glow, feels-004 momentum, feels-005 associative warmth) to cross-cutting emotional guarantees (feels-006 forward momentum, feels-007 depleted user dignity, feels-008 human thread). Every element traces to specific moments in the Andreas call AND specific cognitive mechanisms in Kahneman. The copy guidelines, animation feels, and tension-relief arcs are emotional prescriptions, not component specifications -- they define what the host should FEEL, leaving the how to the layers below."
