      "problem": "Tyler's search parameters include both hard constraints (Chelsea location, ~$2000 budget, private bathroom) and soft constraints (Saturday-Wednesday ideal but flexible to Sunday-Thursday). The current platform shows listings as a flat list with no indication of how well each listing matches the guest's specific day requirements. The agent spent the entire call extracting and mentally computing match quality — work that the information architecture should do automatically. Eyal's Action principle (Ch 3) requires reducing brain cycles: the guest should not have to mentally compute 'does this listing's available days overlap with my preferred days?'",
      "solution": "Structure search results to communicate match quality visually and immediately: (1) PRIMARY: Match score for each listing — a simple percentage or visual indicator showing how well the listing's available days overlap with the guest's preferred days. 'This space matches 5 of your 5 ideal nights' vs. '3 of 5 nights match — available Sunday-Wednesday.' (2) SECONDARY: Price per matched night — not just nightly rate, but cost for the guest's specific day pattern. (3) TERTIARY: Flexibility bonus — show what the guest gains by being flexible: 'If you shift to Sunday-Wednesday, this space becomes available at $1,750/month.' The information hierarchy should be: Match Quality → Price for Your Pattern → Flexibility Upside → Space Details.",

      "problem": "Tyler anchored on $1800/month (Nina's posted price for Mon-Fri) but his different day requirements (Saturday-Wednesday, including weekends) may change the price. The agent noted 'weekends usually more expensive' (11:06). Tyler said 'around 2000... don't push up the price' (11:27-12:07). There is a critical information asymmetry: the guest sees one posted price but doesn't understand how days-of-week affect pricing. When the price changes during negotiation, it feels like a bait-and-switch rather than a rational adjustment. Eyal's Variable Reward theory (Ch 4) warns that rewards must feel positive — price increases during the funnel feel like anti-rewards.",
      "solution": "Structure pricing information to make day-based pricing transparent from the first touchpoint: (1) On the listing page, show a day-of-week pricing matrix: each night has a visible rate. Weekends may be marked as 'premium' or 'off-peak.' (2) When the guest selects their preferred days, show an instant price calculation: 'Saturday ($55/night) + Sunday ($55/night) + Monday ($40/night) + Tuesday ($40/night) + Wednesday ($40/night) = $270/week = $1,080/4 weeks.' (3) Show the comparison: 'Nina's posted rate ($1,800/mo) is for Mon-Fri. Your Sat-Wed pattern is $X/mo because weekends are included.' This makes price differences feel rational, not arbitrary. The information hierarchy should be: Your Total → Per-Night Breakdown → Comparison to Posted Rate.",

The agent assembled these into a mental model over 15 minutes. On the platform, these requirements must be visible and editable throughout the search and proposal flow — not scattered across separate pages or hidden after initial entry. Eyal's Investment principle (Ch 5) shows that visible stored value increases commitment and switching costs.",
      "solution": "Display the guest's requirements as a persistent, collapsible summary that follows them through search, listing evaluation, and proposal creation: (1) Show a compact 'Your Search' sidebar or header strip with key parameters: 'Chelsea | Sat-Wed | ~$2,000/mo | Dec-Jan+ | Private bath.' (2) Make each parameter tappable to edit inline — changing a parameter immediately updates search results. (3) When viewing a listing, show match/mismatch indicators next to each requirement: green check for match, yellow warning for partial match, red X for conflict. (4) Carry the profile forward into proposal creation — the proposal form should be pre-filled from the profile. This makes the guest's investment visible and useful at every step, not just at data entry.",

Tyler needs to see: 'This week: arriving Saturday Dec 6. Anything to update?' not 'Here is a 16-week calendar with all your stays.'",
      "solution": "Structure the active lease view as a next-action dashboard: (1) PRIMARY: This Week's Stay — large, prominent card showing arrival date, any notes from host, and one-tap check-in action.
