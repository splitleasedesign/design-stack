      "problem": "Tyler arrived at Split Lease through Craigslist — a foreign platform intermediating his Craigslist search. His emotional state is curiosity mixed with suspicion: 'What is this thing that's sitting between me and the listing I found?' The current experience is a phone call that resolves this uncertainty through human warmth, but the phone call is unscalable. The platform must replicate the emotional journey from suspicious curiosity to empowered search without a human intermediary.",
      "solution": "The emotional design should transition the guest from 'What is this?' (curiosity + suspicion) to 'I'm in control of my search' (confidence + empowerment) within 30 seconds of arriving. (1) CURIOSITY: The external listing hook got them here. Maintain that curiosity by immediately showing the listing they came for — don't distract with platform explanation. (2) SUSPICION RELIEF: Small, factual trust signals: 'Split Lease manages scheduling and payments between you and the host. Here since 2019.' Not emotional claims ('We love our guests!'), but factual reassurance. (3) EMPOWERMENT: The moment the guest touches the day selector and sees results update, they feel in control. This transition from passive viewer to active searcher is the emotional turning point.",

'Welcome back, Tyler' — not 'Confirm your check-in for booking #4521.' (3) REWARD: Each stay builds a narrative. After 4 stays: 'You've spent 20 nights in Chelsea this month.
