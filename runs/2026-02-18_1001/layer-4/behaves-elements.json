      "problem": "Tyler's flexibility on days is the key to matching. In the call, the agent had to ask Tyler multiple questions over several minutes to understand his flexibility, then mentally compute which listings might match. On the platform, when the guest toggles a day chip, there should be immediate visual feedback showing how the change affects available matches and pricing. Without real-time feedback, the guest is operating blind — toggling days with no understanding of the impact. Eyal's Action phase (Ch 3) requires immediate feedback to complete the hook cycle's action step.",
      "solution": "When the guest interacts with the day-of-week selector: (1) Each chip toggle triggers an immediate (under 200ms) update to the results count and listing order. (2) The update should be optimistic — show the new count immediately with a subtle loading indicator while the actual query completes. (3) If adding a 'flexible' day reveals new listings, animate them in with a gentle slide-down (300ms, ease-out). (4) If removing a day eliminates listings, fade them out (200ms) with a count indicator: 'Removing Friday hides 2 listings.' (5) Price updates on visible listings should animate numerically (counter transition) to draw attention to the change. The interaction should feel like a mixing board — each toggle produces an immediate, visible, and reversible change.",

The platform must make check-in faster and easier than sending a text — otherwise the guest will default to the lower-friction option.

(2) PROGRESSIVE ENHANCEMENT: After tapping, an optional expansion shows: estimated arrival time (quick-select chips: 'Morning', 'Afternoon', 'Evening'), and a free-text note field. These are optional — the one-tap action is complete even without them. (3) LOCATION AWARENESS: If the guest grants location permission, the check-in can auto-trigger when they're near the space: 'Looks like you're near your Chelsea space. Check in?'
