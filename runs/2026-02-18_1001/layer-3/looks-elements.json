      "problem": "The nights-of-the-week model is Split Lease's core differentiator but has no distinct visual language. Tyler expressed his preferences as 'Saturday through Wednesday' — a pattern that needs a visual representation as clear and immediate as a traffic light. Currently, day selection is handled through generic form controls (dropdowns, calendars). The Hook Model's Action phase (Ch 3) requires the action to be as easy as possible. Day selection must be visually scannable in under 2 seconds.",
      "solution": "Create a signature day-chip component that uses color states to encode match quality: (1) SELECTED (guest's ideal days) — solid purple fill (#31135D background, white text). (2) FLEXIBLE (guest would consider these days) — purple outline with light fill (#F7F2FA background, #31135D border and text). (3) AVAILABLE (host has these days open but guest hasn't selected) — light gray fill (#f3f4f6, #6b7280 text). (4) UNAVAILABLE — very light gray with strikethrough (#e5e7eb, #9ca3af text). The chips should be 40px circular badges (matching existing day-badge pattern) arranged in a horizontal row Mon-Sun, creating a visual 'week fingerprint' that is instantly scannable.",

      "problem": "When Tyler evaluates listings, the most critical information is whether the listing's available days match his preferred days. This match quality has no visual representation in the current design. Listing cards show photos, prices, and locations — standard real estate patterns — but don't communicate the unique value of nights-of-the-week matching. The Hook Model's Variable Reward (Ch 4) creates dopamine through discovery — seeing a 'perfect match' indicator should trigger the 'hunt' reward response.",
      "solution": "Add a prominent match quality indicator to each listing card: (1) VISUAL: A circular progress ring (32px) in the top-left corner of the listing card showing match percentage. Full ring = perfect match (all requested nights available). Partial ring = partial match. (2) COLOR: Perfect match uses success purple (#4B47CE). Partial match uses a lighter purple variant. Low match uses muted gray. (3) LABEL: Inside the ring, show the fraction: '5/5' for perfect match, '3/5' for partial. Below the ring: 'Full match' or 'Partial match — available Sun-Wed.' (4) POSITION: Top-left overlay on the listing photo — visible before any other information.

The Hook Model's autonomy principle (Ch 4) requires the guest to feel in control of their pricing.",
      "solution": "Use horizontal bar segments to visualize day rates: (1) Each day of the guest's pattern is a horizontal bar whose length represents the nightly rate relative to the most expensive night. (2) Weekend nights (if premium) are visually distinguished with a subtle pattern or slightly different purple shade. (3) The total monthly cost appears as a large number above the bars. (4) Each bar is labeled: 'Saturday — $55' with the bar extending proportionally.
