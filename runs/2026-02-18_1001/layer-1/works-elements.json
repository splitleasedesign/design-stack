      "journey_phases": ["search", "listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Tyler's primary matching variable is day-of-week flexibility (Saturday-Wednesday ideal, Sunday-Wednesday acceptable, Sunday-Thursday possible). Currently, this flexibility is extracted through a 15-minute phone call where the agent asks probing questions and translates verbal answers into matching parameters. The platform has no mechanism for guests to express and visualize how adjusting their day preferences affects available matches and pricing. Eyal's Action phase (Ch 3) requires minimizing the effort of the intended behavior. A phone call to express 'I'm flexible on days' is the maximum-effort version of an action that should be as easy as toggling day chips.",
      "solution": "Design a day-of-week flexibility selector that lets guests: (1) Select their ideal days as the primary configuration. (2) Mark additional days as 'flexible' — meaning they could shift to those days if it improves matching or pricing. (3) See real-time feedback showing how flexibility changes results: 'Your ideal days match 2 listings. Adding Sunday expands to 5 listings.' This makes flexibility visible, valuable, and self-service. The pattern should work like a Hook Model Action: minimal effort (tapping day chips) with immediate reward (seeing more options appear). The agent call revealed that flexibility is the single most important variable for matching success — the agent's exact words were 'That sounds much better because now I have something to work with' (18:13) when Tyler expanded his flexible days.",

All of this data was captured by the agent in the agent's notes — none of it was stored in the platform. Eyal's Investment phase (Ch 5) shows that stored value creates switching costs and loads the next trigger. Tyler has zero stored value on Split Lease. If the agent disappears, Tyler's data disappears. The guest can walk away with zero cost because they've invested nothing in the platform.",
      "solution": "Design the first guest interaction to capture and store investment in the platform, not the agent. (1) When a guest responds to a listing (from Craigslist or any channel), immediately create a guest profile that stores their requirements as structured data: preferred location, days, budget, duration, amenities. (2) Show the guest their profile: 'Here's what we know about you so far' — making the stored value visible. (3) Use the stored requirements to pre-fill future searches, proposals, and communications. (4) Send the guest an owned trigger (email, app notification) that references their stored preferences: 'We found 3 spaces in Chelsea that match your Saturday-Wednesday schedule.'

      "problem": "Tyler's use case creates a repeating weekly pattern: arrive Saturday, stay through Wednesday, leave Thursday, repeat. This happens for 2+ months, creating 8+ weekly cycles. Each cycle involves: arrival notification, stay experience, cleaning, departure. The platform currently treats the lease as a single long event rather than a series of discrete stay cycles. Eyal's Hook Model (Ch 1-5) shows that habit formation requires repeated cycles of Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment. The weekly stay cycle IS the hook cycle, but only if the platform captures each iteration. Without platform involvement in each weekly cycle, the guest manages stays via text messages and the platform loses the opportunity for habit formation.",
      "solution": "Design the active lease as a series of weekly hook cycles, not a single long-term event. Each week: (1) TRIGGER: Send the guest a notification 24-48 hours before their next stay ('Your Chelsea stay starts Saturday — anything to update?'). This is an owned trigger that becomes internal over time. (2) ACTION: One-tap check-in when arriving. The action must be simpler than texting the host. (3) VARIABLE REWARD: Each stay is slightly different — different host interactions, different neighborhood discoveries, different routines. Surface these variations: 'Your 4th stay in Chelsea! Local tip: new gallery opening on W 24th this week.' (4) INVESTMENT: End-of-stay cleaning photo upload and one-tap micro-review. Each investment improves future stays: accumulated reviews build trust score, cleaning photos build reputation, date adjustment history informs scheduling. This transforms 8+ weeks of lease into 8+ hook cycles, each strengthening the habit.",

Frame it as value: 'Get instant alerts when Chelsea spaces match your Saturday-Wednesday schedule.' (2) OWNED → INTERNAL: Once in active lease, the weekly stay cycle creates natural internal triggers. The platform should reinforce these: 'You always check in on Saturdays — your space is ready.' Over time, the guest should open the app automatically before each stay without needing a push notification. (3) Measure migration: track what percentage of guest actions are initiated by external triggers (agent outreach) vs. owned triggers (notifications) vs. internal triggers (unprompted app opens).
