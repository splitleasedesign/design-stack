The new element (Weekly Stay Cycle as Hook Loop) prescribes designing the active lease as a series of weekly hook cycles. Both recognize that the Stays Manager is the foundational architecture for guest engagement.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: each phase transition must signal continuity. New evidence: the weekly stay cycle IS a series of phase transitions (arrive → stay → depart → review → prepare for next). Both use cognitive fluency as the theoretical basis — the existing element via Kahneman's associative coherence, the new element via Eyal's Hook Model. Combined insight: the weekly stay cycle is both a hook cycle AND a series of micro-phase-transitions, each requiring System 1 approval.",

The existing element prescribes matching the platform's cognitive speed to the phone call. The new element (Self-Service Flexibility Expression) prescribes making day-of-week flexibility expression faster on the platform than during a phone call. Both use the same benchmark: if the guest can express it verbally in N seconds, the platform must capture it in under 1.5N seconds.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: Andreas describes two units in 7 seconds of speech. New evidence: Tyler negotiates day flexibility over 10 minutes of back-and-forth. The flexibility selector should reduce this to 30 seconds. Both cite Eyal/Kahneman on the law of least effort. The combined insight: platform interactions must be faster than conversation for both SIMPLE information (unit descriptions) and COMPLEX information (day-of-week flexibility patterns).",

The new element (Guest Investment Capture at First Contact) prescribes capturing the guest's investment data in the platform at first contact instead of in the agent's notes.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: the agent promises email exchange and follow-up, but the platform is never mentioned. New evidence: Tyler provides all his requirements to the agent but the platform stores none of them. Both recognize the same structural problem: the agent IS the platform from the user's perspective. Combined insight: the bridge must be bi-directional — trust flows from human to platform AND data flows from conversation to database.",

The new element prescribes a trigger migration pathway from agent-dependency to platform-dependency. Both use Eyal's trigger theory as the theoretical basis.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: Brad texts Nneka to reschedule because texting is faster than the platform. New evidence: Tyler's only trigger is the agent's phone call — zero platform triggers established. Combined insight: trigger migration must address TWO failure modes — (1) the guest texting the host instead of using the platform (nneka run), and (2) the guest depending on the agent instead of the platform (Tyler run). The platform must be faster than both texting AND calling.",

The new element specifies the information hierarchy: next action → upcoming exceptions → history → full calendar.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: Stays Manager is the most-visited page (13+ visits per lease).

The calm-during-waiting must not decay into apathy."

The main risk is the waiting period (between search and match) where the arc dips into passive calm. The waiting period anxiety management element (feels-004) addresses this by maintaining engagement signals. Overall, the arc is sound and aligns with both the Hook Model's trigger-action-reward-investment cycle and the guest journey's progression from stranger to resident."
