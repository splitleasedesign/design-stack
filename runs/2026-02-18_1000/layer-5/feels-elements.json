      "problem": "Dana carries emotional trauma from bad tenant experiences. The fish-cooking WFH tenant is not just a bad memory — it's an active fear that colors every interaction with new guests. When she evaluates Split Lease or reviews a proposal, her default emotional state is defensive and vigilant, not open and curious. The platform's current tone likely uses generic marketplace language ('Great news! You have a new proposal!') that doesn't acknowledge or address the host's protective stance. This disconnect between the host's emotional reality and the platform's tone creates a trust gap.",
      "solution": "The platform's emotional signature at guest-matching touchpoints should be 'protective confidence' — communicating 'we've done the screening so you don't have to worry.' (1) Proposal notifications should lead with the match quality, not the excitement: 'Allen matches your preferences: Mon-Thu, secondary address' not 'You have a new proposal!' (2) Guest profiles should feel like professional vetting reports, not marketplace listings. Use the three-tier text hierarchy (looks-002) to present verified facts prominently and unverified claims in lighter text. (3) The overall visual personality at these touchpoints should align with Refactoring UI's guidance on 'choosing a personality' — 'secure and professional' like a banking site, not 'fun and playful' like a social app.",
