The existing library element (Design for the Depleted User at Every Step After the First) prescribes smart defaults, save-and-resume, and decompression moments based on Kahneman's ego depletion research. The new element (Glanceable Status Design for Time-Fragmented Hosts) extends this to a specific user archetype: the physically absent, time-fragmented host (flight attendant) who cannot sit down for even a short session.",
      "combined_evidence": "Existing evidence: Kahneman's parole judge study shows depleted decision-makers default to denial. New evidence: Dana's flight schedule means she cannot even reach the depletion stage — she has 5-second windows, not 5-minute sessions. The combined insight: depletion-aware design must handle not just 'tired user finishing a long task' but also 'absent user doing a micro-check between obligations.' The spacing and hierarchy principles from Refactoring UI provide concrete implementation guidance that the Kahneman-based element lacked.",

The existing library element (Match the Platform's Cognitive Speed to the Phone Call's Conversational Speed) prescribes quick-select chips, toggle switches, and immediate feedback to match conversational efficiency. The new element (Existing Listing Import as Primary Onboarding Path) provides a specific implementation: import from existing platforms to eliminate redundant data entry entirely.",
      "combined_evidence": "Existing evidence: Andreas describes two units in 7 seconds of speech; the platform must match. New evidence: Dana already has a complete listing on Furnished Finder — the fastest platform interaction is no interaction at all (import instead of create).

The existing library element (Bridge Human Trust to Digital Trust Through Continuity Priming) prescribes that the platform should reference the call, show the agent's name, and feel like a continuation of the conversation. The new element's feels-003 (Respectful Patience During Evaluation Delay) extends this by addressing the timing dimension: the trust bridge must accommodate weeks or months of delay, not just hours.",
      "combined_evidence": "Existing evidence: Andreas's call primes expectations for a follow-up from Bryant. New evidence: Dana's call ends with 'whether it's next week or in a couple of months' — the trust bridge must survive a long gap without degrading. The combined insight: continuity priming must be durable (works over weeks) and patient (doesn't erode through aggressive follow-up).",

      "combined_evidence": "Existing evidence: Andreas shifts from evaluator to advisor at 5:12 when he starts recommending furnishing approaches. New evidence: Dana has years of hosting expertise and an existing listing — a blank 6-step wizard is insulting to her expertise level.

Both serve the same emotional goal: making the host feel respected.",
