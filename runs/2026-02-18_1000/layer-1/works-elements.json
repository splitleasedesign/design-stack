      "problem": "The host's primary decision criterion is guest type (occupancy pattern, lifestyle, presence level), not pricing or dates. Dana explicitly categorizes guests into two archetypes: ideal (travel nurses — part-week, clean, responsible, secondary address) and nightmare (WFH full-timers — daily presence, cooking, using space as primary home). The current platform likely surfaces guest name, dates, and pricing as primary information, with occupancy pattern buried or unlabeled. This forces hosts like Dana to hunt for the one piece of information that determines her accept/reject decision, which Refactoring UI identifies as a hierarchy failure: 'When everything in an interface is competing for attention, it feels noisy and chaotic.'",
      "solution": "Make guest occupancy pattern the visually dominant element in every screen where a guest appears (proposal cards, guest profiles, active lease views, review prompts). Apply Refactoring UI's 'emphasize by de-emphasizing' principle: don't make the occupancy pattern bigger — make everything else (dates, pricing, bio text) visually softer so the occupancy pattern naturally stands out. Specific implementation: (1) Show a weekly day-pattern indicator (Mon-Thu highlighted, Fri-Sun empty) as the first visual element in any guest card. (2) Show 'Secondary Address' or 'Primary Residence' as a visual badge using the principle that 'the format itself communicates' — no label needed if the badge design is clear. (3) De-emphasize date ranges and pricing to secondary visual weight using lighter font weight and softer color, per Refactoring UI's hierarchy system. (4) For proposals, the guest-type signal should be visible before the host even taps into the detail view.",

She engages with any platform in brief, distracted bursts between flights or family obligations. The platform's current design likely assumes a host who can sit down and engage with a dashboard for several minutes. For Dana, every screen must answer the question 'what's happening right now and what do I need to do?' in under 5 seconds. Refactoring UI's spacing and hierarchy principles show that this requires ruthless information prioritization: 'start with too much white space' means removing everything that isn't essential to the glance, and 'not all elements are equal' means making the status/action item visually dominant over everything else.",
      "solution": "Design every host-facing screen with a 'glance layer' and a 'detail layer.' The glance layer is what the host sees in the first 2 seconds: current status + next required action (if any). The detail layer is everything else, accessible by scrolling or tapping but never competing with the glance layer. Apply Refactoring UI's principles: (1) Use visual hierarchy (size, weight, contrast) to make status information impossible to miss. (2) Use generous white space around status elements to prevent them from blending into surrounding content. (3) Apply the 'avoid ambiguous spacing' principle to create clear visual grouping between status items and action items. (4) For the active lease dashboard: the glance layer shows 'Guest arriving [day]' or 'No upcoming stays' — period. Everything else is below the fold. (5) For notifications: use Refactoring UI's contrast principles to make actionable notifications visually distinct from informational ones.",

(2) Fresh Track: The current wizard, but only for hosts who have no existing listing.

(2) In proposal views: show a visual compatibility score or match indicator that maps the guest's profile against the host's stated preferences.
