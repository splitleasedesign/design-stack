      "problem": "The current guest card / proposal view likely follows a conventional layout: guest name, photo, dates, pricing — treating all data points with near-equal visual weight. For Dana, the critical information is the guest's weekly occupancy pattern (Mon-Thu vs. full-week) and address status (secondary vs. primary). These are the data points that determine her accept/reject decision in seconds. Presenting them at equal weight with dates and pricing forces Dana to scan the entire card to find what matters, violating Refactoring UI's core hierarchy principle: 'when everything in an interface is competing for attention, it feels noisy and chaotic.'",
      "solution": "Restructure the guest card information hierarchy so occupancy pattern is primary, personal context is secondary, and logistics are tertiary. Apply Refactoring UI's three-tier text color system: dark color for primary content (occupancy pattern), grey for secondary content (guest bio, work type), lighter grey for tertiary content (exact dates, per-night pricing). Use the 'labels are a last resort' principle: show the occupancy pattern as a visual day-badge row (M T W T highlighted, F S S dim) rather than a labeled field. Combine label and value per the book's guidance: instead of 'Stay Type: Part-week', show '4 nights/week · Mon-Thu' as a single integrated phrase.",

Each screen should present exactly one decision with supporting context, using Refactoring UI's spacing principles to create breathing room. (1) For listing creation: each wizard step should show one question with smart defaults pre-selected, not a form with multiple fields. Use the 'start with too much white space' principle to prevent the screen from feeling dense. (2) For pricing: show only the host's take-home number first (visually dominant, large, dark text). Show the calculation breakdown only on request (expandable section, lighter text). (3) For onboarding follow-up materials: show one call-to-action per screen. Not 'Here's Split Lease, here's how it works, here's what to do next' — just 'Your listing is ready to import. Tap to review.'
