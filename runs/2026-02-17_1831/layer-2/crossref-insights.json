  "crossref_summary": "Scanning 48 host transcripts and 20 guest transcripts reveals that every single SpareRoom disappointment has direct parallel frustrations expressed by real Split Lease users. The transcripts powerfully validate three clusters: (1) The search-and-evaluation cluster is validated by guests like Tom C who explicitly says 'I'm not sure how the content is' and cannot find listings matching his needs, Vince who says 'I've never done something like this' and needs the entire concept explained, and Valerie who says she 'would feel like I'm moving every single week' when the listing page failed to make the shared-living reality self-evident. (2) The communication-and-commitment cluster is validated by hosts like Cristina who says 'it is so slow, it's very hard to navigate' about the platform, Chantel who identified specific confusing elements and said 'that's a little confusing' about redundant terminology, and guests like Susan who insists 'I have to see the room before she puts her tickets' because the platform provides no trust scaffolding. (3) The lifecycle-amnesia cluster is validated by hosts like Chantel who built elaborate manual inventory checklists between guests, Nneka whose rescheduling happens entirely through ad-hoc texting with no platform support, and Hemeden who says 'I don't really want two people coming in and out of my house' because there is no review or reputation system to make strangers feel safe. The strongest signal is that every transcript shows users building manual workarounds for processes that no platform has designed: hosts build their own checklists, guests call agents because the website cannot answer basic questions, and the entire matching-to-move-in pipeline is mediated by humans because no self-service flow exists. Craigslist is mentioned as a discovery channel in 5+ transcripts, confirming that classified-ads platforms are the actual competitor mental model users carry into Split Lease.",
