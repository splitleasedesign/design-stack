      "reason": "The reverse-benchmark has now produced 7 UI elements for the guest evaluation and commitment phases, but all are based on competitor analysis rather than direct user validation. A design-stack run analyzing the same transcripts through a different theoretical lens would validate or refine the information hierarchy (people-first listing), first-contact scaffolding, and emotional milestone design. The cross-process reinforcement would be exceptionally valuable."
    },
    {
      "process_type": "design-stack",
      "recommendation": "Run a host-focused design-stack using Chantel, Cristina, and Nneka transcripts with an operations/service design book to design the host-side Stays Manager experience.",
      "reason": "The rb-ui-004 (Host Turnover Checklist) is a single element addressing a deeply complex operational need. Chantel's transcript reveals extensive manual processes (inventory, cleaning protocols, access codes, building information) that a single checklist cannot fully capture. A full design-stack run would produce the complete host-side Stays Manager architecture: turnover checklists, guest communication tools, schedule management, and earnings visibility."

    {
      "process_type": "reverse-benchmark",
      "recommendation": "Run a reverse-benchmark analyzing Roomgo or Ideal Flatmate (SpareRoom's closest UK competitors) through a behavioral economics lens (Thaler's 'Nudge' or Ariely's 'Predictably Irrational').",
      "reason": "This SpareRoom run revealed category-wide gaps (no commitment path, no active-stay management, no emotional design). Analyzing a second flatshare competitor would validate whether these gaps are truly category-universal or SpareRoom-specific. A behavioral economics lens would complement the Krug usability lens by adding choice architecture and nudge design to the opportunity set."
    },
    {
      "process_type": "reverse-benchmark",
      "recommendation": "Run a reverse-benchmark analyzing Furnished Finder or Zeus Living (US long-term furnished rental competitors) through a trust/safety lens.",
      "reason": "The discovery and evaluation phases remain thinly covered. Analyzing a platform that competes more directly with Split Lease's US mid-term stay market would produce elements specifically for the trust-building needed to commit to a 3-month shared living arrangement with a stranger -- the core emotional challenge every transcript reveals."
