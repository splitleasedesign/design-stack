Every phase past discovery forces users to think harder, not less: search results that demand serial reading instead of scanning, listing pages that bury the human factors behind unstructured text walls, a messaging system that hands you a blank field at a moment of peak social anxiety, and then — nothing. The entire post-contact journey is a void where users must invent processes from scratch. Krug's fundamental insight is that every unnecessary question mark in a user's head is a design failure. SpareRoom doesn't just leave question marks — it leaves entire unwritten chapters that users must author themselves, at the exact moments when the stakes of getting it wrong mean living with a stranger who clips their toenails in the kitchen.",

Krug's Chapter 2 documents that users satisfice — they click the first reasonable option. But when every result looks equally reasonable (or equally unreasonable), satisficing degrades into random clicking.
