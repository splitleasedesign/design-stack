      "problem": "Throughout Hemeden's call, the host must actively interrogate the system to discover what controls and protections exist. She asks about legal protections (03:01), organizational structure (00:00), guest acquisition (02:00), payment timing (15:42), and tax obligations (05:36). Each question represents a signifier the platform failed to provide. Norman states that 'people need some way of understanding the product or service they wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening, and what the alternative actions are.' The host is forced into detective mode at every phase because the platform's system image does not proactively communicate what she can do, what protections she has, or what the outcomes of her actions will be. This pattern is especially damaging for novice hosts who have no prior conceptual model to draw on.",
      "solution": "At every phase where the host faces a decision or a new context, the platform must proactively surface signifiers that communicate: (1) what controls the host has available (set max stay, limit guest count, choose payment timing), (2) what protections are already in place (anti-squatter clause, damage deposit held by platform, payment guarantee), and (3) what the outcomes of their choices will be. Signifiers must be perceivable without interaction -- they appear on the screen before the host asks for them. The pattern is: show the controls and protections BEFORE asking for a decision, not after the host wonders about them. If the phone call had to verbally explain a protection, that protection was not signified on the platform. Every verbal explanation from the call becomes a design requirement for a visible signifier.",

Her listing is defined by what she will NOT accept. Norman identifies four kinds of constraints -- physical, cultural, semantic, and logical -- and all four are present: physical (private room in occupied home), cultural (personal comfort boundaries with strangers), semantic (stays over 30 nights change the legal and tax meaning), and logical (one person at a time is the only configuration that works for her life). If the listing creation flow foregrounds amenities and photos but buries availability constraints and guest-count limits as optional or advanced settings, it will violate this host's conceptual model of what her listing IS. For owner-occupant hosts, the listing is a fortress, not a storefront.",
      "solution": "For owner-occupant hosts, invert the listing creation hierarchy: constraints come first, features second. The first screen of listing creation should ask: (1) How many guests at a time? (2) Maximum stay duration? (3) When is the space available? (4) Any non-negotiable rules? Only after constraints are established does the flow move to features (room description, amenities, photos). This inversion serves two purposes: it signals to the host that the platform understands their primary concern (safety and control), and it enables the platform to enforce constraints in proposal management -- filtering out incompatible guests before the host ever sees them. Norman's principle of 'constraints that force the desired behavior' applies: the platform should use the host's constraints to prevent incompatible proposals from reaching her, not just record them for display.",

      "problem": "Hemeden sets a nightly rate of $75 (13:28), but this single input conceals a complex system of interactions that are invisible to her. Stays under 30 nights trigger occupancy tax collection (05:36-06:53), but she does not know her local tax rate (06:36). The platform's fee structure affects her net income, but this is never shown. She nearly abandoned when told payment comes at end of stay (16:20) and only agreed when payment timing was adjusted to 24 hours after arrival (17:03). Norman states that 'feedback -- communicating the results of an action -- is a well-known concept' and that 'feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting.' Hemeden is asked to make pricing decisions with zero real-time feedback about their financial consequences. Her nightly rate of $75 could net her vastly different amounts depending on stay length, tax obligations, and platform fees -- but she cannot see any of this.",
      "solution": "Every pricing input must produce immediate, visible financial feedback showing the host exactly what they will earn under realistic scenarios. When the host enters a nightly rate, the platform instantly shows: (1) estimated net income per week and per month after platform fees, (2) the tax impact for stays under vs. over 30 nights (with the host's local tax rate pre-filled if possible, or a clear prompt to enter it), and (3) the payment timing -- when exactly the money arrives in their account. This feedback updates in real time as inputs change. The same principle applies during proposal review: show net income for this specific proposal, not just the gross nightly rate. During active leases, payment notifications must arrive within 24 hours of guest arrival, not at end of stay. Norman's refrigerator analogy applies: the host's pricing and duration controls interact in non-obvious ways, and the platform must make these interactions visible rather than forcing the host to discover them through trial and error.",

Every external verification requirement is evidence that the platform's system image is incomplete -- it cannot answer the host's question internally, so the host must go elsewhere.

(2) For tax obligations, integrate local tax rate lookup by zip code so the host can see their estimated tax impact within the platform, eliminating the research homework. (3) For payment timing, present multiple options with clear consequences (e.g., '24 hours after arrival: you get paid Tuesday for a Monday check-in' vs. 'end of stay: you get paid Saturday for a Monday-Friday stay') so the host can decide immediately rather than deferring.

      "problem": "Hemeden's entire conceptual model of Split Lease is constructed from a phone call with the COO and Bryant. She understands: a service that finds one guest at a time, protects her legally with a signed clause, handles payment 24 hours after arrival, and manages taxes. She is a novice ('I just started doing this,' 13:48) with no prior hosting framework to draw on. Norman states that 'the designer expects the user's model to be identical to the design model, but because designers cannot communicate directly with users, the entire burden of communication is on the system image.' When Hemeden encounters the platform for the first time, every element she sees must reinforce -- not contradict -- the model she built from the call. If the call said 'payment 24 hours after arrival' but the platform says 'payment upon stay completion,' her conceptual model fractures. If the call used plain language ('we collect the payment from the guest') but the platform uses legal or technical language, the mapping from verbal model to digital experience breaks. Hemeden even signals residual uncertainty: 'I think you've answered almost all the questions I have' (17:08) -- the word 'almost' marks open loops that will become fracture points if the digital experience contradicts rather than closes them.",
      "solution": "Audit every platform touchpoint against the vocabulary, promises, and structure communicated during host calls. Create a verbal-to-digital concordance that ensures: (1) Platform terminology matches call terminology. If Bryant says 'cleaning fee,' the platform must not say 'hospitality preparation charge.' If the COO says 'guests explicitly agree the property is not a primary residence,' the platform must surface this exact framing, not a paraphrase that alters the meaning. (2) Platform workflows match call-described processes. If the call described payment as '24 hours after guest arrives,' the platform's payment flow must show this timing explicitly at every relevant touchpoint (proposal acceptance, booking confirmation, payment notification). (3) The two-person structure from the call (COO for legal, Bryant for operations) must be reflected or simplified on the platform. If the host's contact was Bryant, Bryant's name and role should be visible. If legal questions were handled by the COO, the legal section should reference that authority. (4) Retention depends on conceptual model consistency. If the first hosting experience matches the call-based model, the host returns. If it diverges, the model breaks and the host leaves.",

Without structured checkpoints, the host must continuously assess whether the arrangement is working, which demands ongoing cognitive effort from someone who is already time-constrained. Norman's feedback principle applies: rather than continuous monitoring (which is draining and unsustainable for a part-time host), the platform should provide structured moments where the host evaluates the status and decides whether to continue.
