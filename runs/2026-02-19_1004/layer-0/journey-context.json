Norman's feedback principle is central: during an active lease, the host needs continuous, timely feedback on payment status, guest compliance, and lease duration. Hemeden explicitly rejects end-of-stay payment (16:20: 'I'm going to have to think about that') and only agrees when payment is moved to 24 hours after arrival (17:03-17:08). This is a feedback-timing issue: the host needs the feedback signal (payment received) to arrive BEFORE the uncertainty window (will I get paid?) becomes anxiety-producing. Norman: 'Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting.' For payment, the delay is not a tenth of a second but the difference between 'before the stay' and 'after the stay' -- and this difference nearly caused a dropout. The 4-week review option (11:44: 'would it be fair to say you would review it after those four weeks?') is a feedback mechanism for lease continuation: the host gets a decision point to evaluate whether to extend.",

Norman's constraint framework (Chapter 4: 'Constraints That Force the Desired Behavior') applies: the platform must encode and enforce these constraints as first-class design elements, not as secondary filters. If the listing creation, proposal management, and active lease phases do not foreground constraint enforcement, this type of host will perceive the platform as unsafe."

If the platform's system image (UI, terminology, workflow) contradicts what she was told in the call, the conceptual model fractures. The most dangerous gap: the call used plain language ('we collect the payment from the guest,' 'guests explicitly agree the property is not a primary residence'), but the platform may use technical or legal language that breaks the mapping."

She explicitly negotiated payment 24 hours after arrival instead of at the end of the stay. This pattern extends across phases: at pricing, she needs immediate feedback on net income; at proposal management, she needs immediate confirmation of accepted terms; during active lease, she needs immediate payment notifications; at retention, she needs a clear financial summary proving the model worked as promised.

Each external verification is evidence that the platform's system image is incomplete. These deferrals span multiple phases and each represents a break in momentum where the host leaves the platform context and may not return. The library already identifies human-to-digital trust transfer as a high-risk pattern (works-004); this call adds a new dimension: trust transfer must also bridge from platform to external authority and back."

Hemeden's experience reveals multiple broken mappings: (1) Setting a nightly rate does not map clearly to net income because tax and fee interactions are invisible (06:57: the 30-night threshold changes the entire financial model). (2) Setting a max stay duration interacts with tax obligations in non-obvious ways (under 30 nights = tax collection required, over 30 nights = squatter risk). (3) Accepting a proposal does not map clearly to what happens next (the call ends with 'send me the documents and I'll have a lawyer look at it' -- the post-acceptance flow is not mapped).
