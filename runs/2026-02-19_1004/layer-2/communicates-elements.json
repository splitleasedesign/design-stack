      "problem": "Hemeden's entire call is organized around boundaries, not features. She specifies: no multiple guests (00:30), no stays over a month (02:50), one person only (01:05), available only after September 10th (08:59), works 9-to-5 so cannot manage complexity (09:43). Traditional listing architectures foreground property features (photos, amenities, room description) and treat constraints as secondary filters or advanced settings. For an owner-occupant host who lives in the space, constraints ARE the listing. Norman's four constraint types -- physical (private room in occupied home), cultural (personal comfort with strangers), semantic (stays over 30 nights change legal meaning), and logical (one person at a time is the only workable configuration) -- are all present and all primary. If the information hierarchy presents amenities before boundaries, it signals that the platform does not understand this host type.",
      "solution": "Invert the default information hierarchy for owner-occupant hosts. The primary information layer on every listing-related screen must be the host's constraints: max guests, max stay duration, availability window, and non-negotiable rules. The secondary layer is property features. The tertiary layer is amenities and extras. This hierarchy must persist across phases: in listing creation, constraints are set first; in proposal management, constraint compatibility is shown before guest details; in evaluation materials, the platform's ability to enforce constraints is communicated before its feature set. The principle is: what the host will NOT accept is more important than what the space offers, because for owner-occupants the space is also their home.",

Norman states that 'people need some way of understanding the product or service they wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening, and what the alternative actions are.' The platform's protections are affordances that exist but lack signifiers: the anti-squatter clause exists in the agreement, the damage deposit is held by the platform, payment guarantees are in place -- but none of these are perceivable to the host before she asks.

The COO explains that stays under 30 nights trigger occupancy tax (05:36-06:53), but Hemeden does not know her local rate (06:36). The COO then explains that staying over 30 nights avoids tax but increases squatter risk (06:57). This is Norman's refrigerator problem: two controls (price and duration) that appear independent but interact in non-obvious ways. Norman's refrigerator had two controls -- one labeled 'freezer,' one labeled 'refrigerator' -- but they were not independent: each affected both compartments. Similarly, Hemeden's nightly rate and stay duration interact through tax thresholds, platform fees, and legal risk. The current information architecture presents these as separate data points (rate here, duration there, tax somewhere else), hiding the interactions that determine the host's actual outcome. The host cannot make an informed pricing decision because the information needed to understand the consequences is scattered across separate, disconnected presentations.",

(2) On proposal review, show the specific net income for that proposal's duration, including any tax impact. (3) On the listing screen, if the host sets a max duration under 30 nights, display a note: 'Stays under 30 nights may include occupancy tax. Your estimated tax rate: [rate or prompt to enter].'

If the platform's proposal information architecture presents guest profiles first and constraint compatibility second, it forces the host to invest cognitive effort reading details about a guest she will instantly reject once she discovers the date mismatch.

      "problem": "Hemeden's entire conceptual model of Split Lease was built from a phone conversation. She heard specific terms: 'cleaning fee' for the trial night (12:10), 'we collect the payment from the guest' (15:08), 'guests explicitly agree the property is not a primary residence' (03:01), '$75 a night' (13:28), and 'review it after those four weeks' (11:44). She is a novice ('I just started doing this,' 13:48) with no prior hosting framework. Norman warns that 'when the system image is incoherent or inappropriate, the user cannot easily use the device. If it is incomplete or contradictory, there will be trouble.' If the platform uses different terminology from the call -- 'hospitality preparation charge' instead of 'cleaning fee,' 'disbursement upon stay completion' instead of 'payment after guest arrives,' 'periodic tenancy agreement' instead of 'booking agreement' -- the host's call-based conceptual model fractures. She must rebuild her understanding of the system, and may not succeed. The information architecture must treat the call vocabulary as canonical and map every platform term to it.",
      "solution": "Create and enforce a verbal-to-digital concordance: a mapping between the terms used in host calls and the terms displayed on the platform. Every platform-facing label, heading, button text, and notification must use the same vocabulary the host heard during her call or initial interaction. Specifically: (1) If the call says 'cleaning fee,' the platform says 'cleaning fee' -- not 'turnover cost,' 'preparation charge,' or 'service fee.' (2) If the call says 'payment 24 hours after guest arrives,' the payment notification says 'Payment for [guest name] -- received 24 hours after arrival, as discussed.' (3) If the call says 'review after 4 weeks,' the checkpoint prompt says 'Your 4-week review is here. Would you like to extend?' (4) For any platform term that was NOT discussed in the call, the platform must introduce it with a brief explanation on first encounter, not assume the host knows what it means. The principle is: the host's first contact with the platform should feel like a continuation of the conversation, not a new context.",

      "problem": "Hemeden works 9-to-5 (09:43), lives in her rental space, and is new to hosting. She cannot monitor the hosting situation continuously. The call reveals her need for specific, structured feedback moments: payment confirmation (negotiated to 24 hours after arrival, 17:03), the 4-week review checkpoint (11:44), and the trial night as a low-risk evaluation before commitment (12:10-13:17). Norman warns that 'poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all, because it is distracting, uninformative, and in many cases irritating and anxiety-provoking,' and that 'too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little.' The information architecture must distinguish between high-priority feedback that demands attention (payment received, lease ending soon) and low-priority feedback that should be available but not intrusive (guest check-in confirmed, routine status). Without this tiering, the host either drowns in notifications and ignores all of them, or receives too little and feels uninformed.",
      "solution": "Design a three-tier feedback architecture for active leases that matches feedback priority to the host's decision needs and time constraints. Tier 1 (immediate, push notification): events that require host awareness within hours -- payment received, payment failed, guest arrived, lease ending in 48 hours, 4-week review due. These are proactive and cannot be missed. Tier 2 (available on dashboard, no push): routine confirmations that the host can check on her schedule -- guest check-in confirmed, cleaning completed, next payment date approaching. These are visible when the host visits the platform but do not interrupt her day. Tier 3 (available on demand): historical records and detailed status -- full payment history, lease agreement details, past communication with the guest. These are accessible when needed but never surfaced proactively. The principle is: feedback priority must match the urgency of the host's decision need. A first-time owner-occupant host needs to know she got paid (Tier 1) but does not need a notification every time the guest enters the space (which would be anxiety-inducing, not helpful).",
