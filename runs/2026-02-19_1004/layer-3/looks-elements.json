      "problem": "Hemeden cannot discover what protections the platform offers without verbally interrogating the COO. The anti-squatter clause, damage deposit, and payment guarantee are all real affordances that lack visual signifiers. She asks about legal protections at 03:01, requests the document at 04:44, and needs her lawyer to verify because she never saw these protections in a scannable, trustworthy visual format. Norman states signifiers are more important than affordances because they communicate how to use the design. For a novice host who lives in her rental space, trust-critical protections that are invisible are protections that do not exist in her mental model. The visual challenge is: how do you make legal and financial protections perceivable at a glance, so the host's first scan of any trust-decision screen immediately communicates safety without requiring reading, clicking, or asking?",
      "solution": "Create a consistent protection badge system using mono typography on an accent-light background to signal data-backed, verifiable claims. Each protection badge presents one protection in a single line of plain language, visually differentiated from surrounding content through font family change (mono signals precision) and a subtle container with left-border accent. Badges appear on every screen where the host faces a trust decision: evaluation pages show 'Anti-squatter clause included,' proposal cards show 'Guest signed non-residency agreement,' payment screens show 'Payment within 24 hours of arrival.' The visual pattern is: icon + mono text + accent-light background = verifiable protection signal. The badge is not a button or a link -- it is a static visual signifier that communicates safety passively, mirroring how a safety certification mark works on a physical product.",

      "problem": "Hemeden defines her listing entirely through constraints: no multiple guests (00:30), no stays over a month (02:50), one person only (01:05), available only after September 10th (08:59). She works 9-to-5 (09:43) and has limited attention. Traditional listing UI foregrounds property photos and amenities, treating constraints as secondary settings or advanced options. For an owner-occupant host, the visual hierarchy must invert: constraints should be the most visually prominent elements because they define the listing's identity. Norman's constraint taxonomy (physical, cultural, semantic, logical) maps to Hemeden's boundaries. The visual challenge is: how do you make constraints feel like the primary content rather than restrictions, while keeping the interface warm and inviting rather than restrictive?",
      "solution": "On listing-related screens, present host constraints as visually prominent, pill-shaped elements using sans bold typography at a size larger than surrounding body text. Each constraint is a short, scannable statement in a bordered container: '1 guest max,' 'Up to 4 weeks,' 'Available Sep 10+,' 'Owner-occupied.' Use the surface-warm background for the listing card and give constraint pills a border-strong outline with ink-soft text, making them feel like defined characteristics rather than warnings. Constraints appear in a horizontal row at the top of the listing card, above the property description and photos. On proposal cards, the same constraint pills appear as a compatibility check: green accent tint for matches, amber tint for near-matches, no color for violations.

      "problem": "Hemeden sets a nightly rate of $75 (13:28) but cannot see what she will actually earn. Tax obligations depend on stay duration (30-night threshold, 06:57), she does not know her local tax rate (06:36), and platform fees are invisible. She nearly abandoned over payment timing (16:20). Norman's refrigerator analogy applies: her pricing and duration controls interact in non-obvious ways but are presented as independent. The visual challenge is: how do you show the host her net income in real time as she adjusts inputs, revealing the interactions between price, duration, and tax without overwhelming her with financial complexity? The display must be immediate (Norman: feedback must be immediate), concrete (dollar amounts, not percentages), and scenario-comparative (under 30 nights vs. over 30 nights).",
      "solution": "Create a financial feedback panel that lives alongside any pricing input, showing two scenario columns side by side: 'Under 30 nights' and '30+ nights.' Each column displays three numbers stacked vertically: gross per night (serif, large), estimated deductions per night (mono, muted, smaller), and net per night (mono, accent, bold, largest). The net income number is the visually dominant element -- largest type size, accent color, mono font -- because it answers the host's real question: 'what will I earn?' The two-column layout makes the interaction between controls visible: the host can see that the same nightly rate produces different net income depending on stay duration. All numbers update within 1 second of any input change using the spring easing token for smooth transitions. A subtle divider separates the two scenarios. Below the columns, a single line in ink-muted shows the tax rate source: 'Estimated for [city name]. Verify with local authority.' This closes the information gap that sent Hemeden on an external research mission.",

Each deferral sends her outside the platform context. Norman's system image principle states the entire burden of communication is on the system image. The visual challenge is: how do you contain all decision-relevant information within a single visible surface so the host never needs to navigate away, scroll extensively, or open external resources to make a standard decision? The host must perceive the decision surface as complete -- everything she needs is visible here, in this one container.",
      "solution": "Create a contained decision card pattern used at every point where the host must commit: agreeing to terms, choosing payment timing, confirming pricing. The card has a white surface background with shadow-md for elevation, creating a distinct visual container separated from the page. Inside the card, the layout follows a strict vertical sequence: (1) context line in serif at 16-18px explaining what decision this is and why, (2) key information block showing the 2-3 data points needed to decide, using mono for numbers and sans for labels, (3) action area with primary button and a secondary 'learn more' text link. The card never scrolls internally -- all content fits within the viewport. A bg-deep page background behind the card creates the visual separation that communicates: 'this card is the decision -- everything outside it is context.' The pattern ensures the host's attention is contained within the decision boundary, reducing the impulse to look elsewhere for missing information.",

She ends with qualified satisfaction (17:08: 'I think you've answered almost all the questions I have'). Norman warns that 'when the system image is incoherent or inappropriate, the user cannot easily use the device.' When Hemeden first opens the platform, every visual element must reinforce -- not contradict -- the model built from the call. If the call said 'Bryant' but the platform shows no mention of Bryant, if the call said '$75 a night' but the first screen shows a different number format, the system image fractures. The visual challenge is: how do you create recognition anchors -- visual elements that immediately connect the digital experience to the verbal conversation -- so the host's first 5 seconds on the platform feel like a continuation, not a new beginning?",
      "solution": "On the host's first authenticated screen, create a personalized welcome header that contains three recognition anchors drawn from the call or onboarding conversation: (1) the agent's name and role in sans at 14px ('Bryant, your hosting coordinator'), (2) the key terms from the host's conversation displayed as familiar summary chips (e.g., '$75/night,' '4 weeks max,' 'Sep 10+'), and (3) a single-sentence next step using the vocabulary from the call ('Bryant mentioned sending you the booking agreement -- here it is'). These recognition anchors use the same sans typography as the rest of the interface but are presented in a surface-warm container with a subtle top border to create a gentle landing zone. The agent's photo or avatar appears at 32px beside their name. The summary chips use the same visual treatment as the constraint pills from looks-002, creating cross-screen recognition.
