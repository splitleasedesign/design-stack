      "problem": "Hemeden nearly abandoned the entire hosting relationship when told payment would arrive at the end of the guest's stay (16:20: 'I'm going to have to think about that'). She only re-engaged when payment timing was shifted to 24 hours after guest arrival (17:03). For an owner-occupant host who lives in the rental space, payment is not just compensation -- it is the primary feedback signal that the system is working and that she made the right decision. Norman states that 'feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up.' Payment timing for a first-time host is not a billing detail; it is the interaction pattern that determines whether the host perceives the platform as trustworthy or risky. Any gap between guest arrival and payment confirmation creates an anxiety window where the host is hosting a stranger in her home with no financial confirmation that the system is functioning.",
      "solution": "Show an optimistic payment status indicator the moment a guest's arrival is confirmed. The pattern proceeds in three stages: (1) On guest arrival confirmation, immediately display a payment status card reading 'Payment processing -- your payout of $X will arrive within 24 hours' with a progress indicator. This is optimistic UI: the host sees forward momentum before the transaction fully settles. (2) When payment clears, replace the processing state with a confirmed state: 'Payment received: $X deposited to your account.' Use Tier 1 notification treatment (accent-light background, serif headline, left accent border) so the host cannot miss it. (3) If payment fails or is delayed, show an explicit error state with the reason and a clear next step, never leaving the host in ambiguity. The pattern must also apply to subsequent weekly payments during an active lease: each payment triggers the same three-stage sequence. Norman's principle: feedback must be immediate, informative, and prioritized. Payment is the highest-priority feedback signal for this host type.",

She evaluated Jade on duration before any personal assessment (10:54). Her decision pattern is binary: does this proposal violate my constraints? If yes, reject immediately. If no, evaluate the person. But without automated constraint gating, the host must manually perform this filter for every proposal, wasting cognitive effort on proposals she would instantly reject. Norman's signifier principle requires that 'signifiers must be perceivable, else they fail to function' -- if constraint compatibility is not the first perceivable signal on a proposal, the host is forced into detective mode. For an owner-occupant host who works 9-to-5 (09:43) and has limited attention, every incompatible proposal that reaches her inbox is a trust-eroding event that signals the platform does not respect her boundaries.",

Layer 2 (host-side): proposals that are near-matches (e.g., dates overlap partially, duration is close to the limit) are shown with constraint compatibility indicators at the top of each card, using the three-band visual structure from looks-004. The interaction pattern when a proposal arrives: (1) push notification with the compatibility verdict in the first line ('New proposal from Jade -- all constraints match'), (2) proposal card opens with Band 1 (compatibility indicators) visible before any guest details, (3) tapping a mismatch indicator expands an inline explanation ('Requested 8 weeks -- your max is 4 weeks.

The COO then describes how duration and tax interact: 'we go certain nights and everybody wins because you don't have to pay uncle Sam or we go less certain nights and then I have to collect the texts on your behalf' (06:57).

Norman states: 'the two controls are not independent. The freezer control also affects the fresh food temperature, and the fresh food control also affects the freezer.'

The net income number is the visually dominant element (largest type, accent color, mono font). (2) When the host adjusts max stay duration on the listing screen, the financial calculator reflects the tax implications instantly: switching from 35 nights to 25 nights triggers the tax scenario to highlight, with a plain-language note: 'Stays under 30 nights include estimated occupancy tax of ~$X per night.'

      "problem": "Hemeden spent a significant portion of the call extracting information about protections she could not discover independently: the anti-squatter clause (03:01-04:44), the damage deposit (15:08), and the payment guarantee. She then requested the legal document for lawyer review (04:44), indicating that verbal disclosure alone was insufficient. Norman states that 'people need some way of understanding the product or service they wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening, and what the alternative actions are.' Every protection that required a phone call to discover represents a failed interaction pattern. The interaction challenge is: how do you reveal protections progressively at the exact moments when the host faces a trust decision, so that each protection appears when it is most relevant and most needed -- not all at once (overwhelming) and not only when asked (too late)?",
      "solution": "Tie protection reveals to trust commitment points using a 'show the shield before asking for the step' pattern. The interaction sequence at each trust decision: (1) BEFORE the host is asked to commit (enter personal information, agree to terms, accept a guest), a protection badge animates in from the left margin, visually entering the host's field of view with purpose. The badge shows the relevant protection in plain language. (2) The commit action (button, toggle, signature) appears AFTER the protection badge has been visible for at least 2 seconds -- enforcing the see-then-act sequence. (3) Tapping a protection badge expands an inline detail panel with the relevant clause in plain language, plus a link to the full document. The detail panel slides down with spring easing, feeling responsive. (4) Dismissing the detail panel collapses it with easing-out and the badge returns to its compact state, still visible. The principle is: at evaluation, show 'Anti-squatter clause included' before asking the host to create an account. At onboarding, show 'Damage deposit held by Split Lease' before asking the host to agree to terms. At proposal acceptance, show 'Guest has signed non-residency agreement' before the accept button becomes active.",

She is a novice (13:48: 'I just started doing this') with no prior hosting framework. Norman warns that 'when the system image is incoherent or inappropriate, the user cannot easily use the device. If it is incomplete or contradictory, there will be trouble.' The first time Hemeden opens the platform after the call, every element she encounters either reinforces or contradicts the model she built from the conversation. If the platform presents a generic onboarding flow with unfamiliar terminology, the host must reconcile two competing system images -- the verbal one from the call and the digital one from the platform. This reconciliation is cognitive work that a novice host may not succeed at, leading to confusion and dropout. The interaction challenge: how does the platform behave as a continuation of the conversation, not a new beginning?",

The interaction sequence: (1) The welcome screen opens with the agent's name and a brief note: 'Bryant set up your hosting profile based on your conversation. Here is what we have so far.' (2) Below the note, the host's key parameters are displayed as editable summary chips (matching the constraint pill visual from looks-002): '$75/night,' 'Max 4 weeks,' 'Available Sep 10+,' '1 guest.' The host can tap any chip to adjust, but the defaults match what was discussed. (3) Below the chips, the pending next steps from the call are listed as a brief checklist: 'Review booking agreement (sent to your email),' 'Confirm your local tax rate,' 'Meet Jade (trial night pending).' Each item links to the relevant platform action. (4) The host taps 'Looks right -- let's continue' to proceed to the dashboard, which preserves the same terminology and parameters. The principle is: the first digital interaction must feel like the conversation is continuing, not starting over. The platform demonstrates that it listened by reflecting back what was discussed.",
