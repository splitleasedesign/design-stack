      "problem": "During listing creation, each wizard step is a micro-death of privacy and a micro-birth of the host identity. If the transition between steps feels abrupt (instant page swap) or uncertain (no confirmation of saved state), the host loses the character armor of completed work and faces the new step undefended. If the transition is too slow or ceremonial, the host lingers at the impasse layer and may retreat.",
      "solution": "On 'Save & Continue,' the current card performs a soft exit: content fades to 80% opacity over 200ms while the progress indicator advances (the completed step dot transitions from accent-bright to accent fill over 300ms using easing-out). After a 100ms hold, the new step card fades in from 0% to 100% opacity over 250ms. Total transition: 550ms. Critically, the save is confirmed by a brief 'Saved' micro-label that appears beside the progress dot for 1.5 seconds — this is the platform's acknowledgment that the character work is preserved. If the host navigates away mid-step, auto-save fires on field blur, and on return the wizard resumes at the exact state left — no work is ever lost.",

If the host adjusts above default (>20% higher), a different note: 'At this price, your listing may take longer to receive proposals.'

If the re-listing flow requires re-entering data, re-uploading photos, or re-navigating the full wizard, the character-work cost of recommitment is too high — the host experiences the full existential weight of listing creation again, but this time with experiential knowledge of what it actually entails. The returning host needs the re-listing flow to honor their prior investment.",
      "solution": "The re-list CTA (on the Legacy Summary page) opens a single confirmation screen — not a wizard. The screen displays the existing listing as a compact review card: listing title, main photo, price, key terms — all pre-populated from the previous lease. The host can tap any section to edit (inline expand, not page navigation), but the default action is 'Re-list as-is' — a full-width accent button. If the host wants to adjust pricing based on their experience, the price section opens with the same slider interaction (behaves-005) but now shows 'Previous price: $X | Recommended: $Y' where Y may have been updated by the algorithm. The entire flow should be completable in under 60 seconds for a host who re-lists without changes.",
