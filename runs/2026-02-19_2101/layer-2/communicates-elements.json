The host needs their character defenses intact to proceed; a flat, all-at-once form strips those defenses away.",
      "solution": "Sequence the wizard using progressive disclosure that mirrors Perls' four neurotic layers in reverse — start with safe cliche-level information (title, location, property type), advance to role-playing inputs (amenities, features via 'Load Common'), delay the impasse-layer content (photos, house rules) until momentum is established, and only present the death-layer content (pricing, go-live confirmation) when the host has invested enough character-work to sustain the final exposure.",

Each step shows only its own fields plus a progress indicator showing completed steps as green checkmarks (character work already invested) and upcoming steps as neutral dots (future vulnerability not yet confronted). The 'Load Common Features' shortcut provides a cliche-layer escape — the host can adopt pre-written descriptions rather than exposing their own words.",
      "cognitive_load_constraint": "Maximum 4 input fields per wizard step. Photo upload step shows a 2x3 grid with the first slot pre-labeled 'Main photo' and remaining slots labeled by room type based on property type selected in step 1. House rules step provides toggleable presets (No smoking, Quiet hours, No pets) rather than free-text composition — preset rules are borrowed armor, reducing the cognitive and emotional cost of articulating personal boundaries.",
      "scan_order": "Step title (serif, large) -> brief reassurance subtitle ('This helps guests know what to expect') -> input fields -> primary action button ('Save & Continue').

Lead with the guest's identity and credibility signals (photo, verified badge, review count, prior stay count), then present the proposal terms (dates, duration, schedule, price), then show the guest's message/intent statement, and finally present the action bar (Accept, Counter, Decline).

The guest's review history is shown as a compact timeline (3 most recent reviews visible, expandable for more). Counter-offer fields are hidden until the host taps 'Counter' — showing negotiation controls prematurely signals that the proposal is inadequate and amplifies doubt.",
      "cognitive_load_constraint": "The guest identity card must convey trustworthiness in 5 data points or fewer: photo, name, verification badge, review score, and stay count. No dense paragraphs of guest bio — the host's vigilant state cannot process narrative text.
