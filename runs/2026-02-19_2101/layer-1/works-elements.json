Each step removes one thin layer of character armor while simultaneously providing a platform-mediated replacement defense (progress indicator, saved state, pre-populated defaults). The completion percentage badge on the listing card converts overwhelming vulnerability into a simple, actionable number — transforming terror into a to-do list.",

Display guest verification status, review history from prior hosts, stay count, and a structured intent summary (dates, schedule, purpose) above the fold. An experienced guest's track record functions as borrowed character armor — past hosts' survival becomes the current host's confidence.
