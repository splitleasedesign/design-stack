      "emotion_rationale": "Becker writes that character defenses 'support a grand illusion' and that the host is 'driven toward things that support the lie of his character.' The listing wizard's emotional job is to support the grand illusion that listing creation is ordinary. The host who completes the wizard should feel competent and organized — not brave, not vulnerable, not exposed. The moment the host feels the weight of what they are doing, they are at Perls' impasse layer, and the risk of abandonment spikes. The wizard must never let the host linger at the impasse; it must keep them moving through manageable pieces that feel routine.",

        "reassurance_subtitles": "Each step gets a single-line subtitle that reframes self-exposure as guest-utility: 'Help guests picture themselves here' (photos), 'Guests filter by these features' (amenities), 'Set expectations upfront' (house rules). The host is told they are helping someone else, not exposing themselves.",
        "field_labels": "Neutral, specific, brief: 'Listing title,' 'Number of bedrooms,' 'Monthly price.' No questions ('What makes your space special?') — questions invite self-reflection, and self-reflection at this stage activates the fear of self-knowledge that Becker identifies as the root of character defense.",
        "completion_nudge": "The completion percentage label on the listing card says 'X% complete' — not 'Almost there!' or 'You're so close!' Enthusiasm reads as pressure during a vulnerable process.",

The progress indicator advances with a gentle fill, not a checkmark slam. On final submission ('Publish'), a brief moment of warmth: the card background washes to accent-light (#e8f0eb) for 500ms before transitioning to the listing detail view. This is the single celebratory moment — a controlled, warm pulse that acknowledges the accomplishment without dramatizing it.",

        "tension_source": "The host is progressively shedding character armor — each step exposes more of their private world to public view. The photo step is the peak tension point: converting private space into public image.",
        "relief_mechanism": "Each 'Save & Continue' provides a micro-relief: the 'Saved' label confirms the work is preserved, the progress indicator shows forward movement, and the new step's fresh card provides a psychological reset. The wizard never shows all remaining steps at once — the host only sees 'what I've done' (green dots) and 'what's next' (single upcoming dot), never the full scope of what remains. The biggest relief comes at publish: the accent-light wash is the platform saying 'You did it, and it's safe.' The wizard then disappears entirely — the host lands on their listing detail page, which reframes the exposed content as a finished product rather than a series of vulnerable disclosures.",
        "failure_recovery": "If the host abandons the wizard mid-step, no guilt-inducing follow-up. The listing card on the dashboard shows 'X% complete' neutrally. After 48 hours, a single email: 'Your listing draft is saved. Pick up anytime.' The language is patient, not urgent — the platform waits for the host's character defenses to regroup."

      "emotion_rationale": "Becker describes the terror of 'billions of individual organismic appetites' — each proposal is one such appetite requesting entry. The host's natural response is hypervigilance: scanning every detail for threat signals. The emotional design must channel this vigilance into a structured assessment framework rather than allowing it to spiral into uncontained anxiety. The host should feel their vigilance is supported and contained by the platform's vetting infrastructure — they are making a decision, not defending a fortress.

        "counter_offer_prompt": "'Adjust the terms to work for you' — this positions the counter-offer as the host exercising rightful authority, not as a rejection of the guest's needs. The framing supports the host's character armor: they are in control of the terms of their own vulnerability.",

On acceptance, the accent-light confirmation modal fades in gently (200ms) — not a celebration, but a resolution.

Each piece of information that checks out lowers the threat level incrementally. The biggest relief comes from the verification badge and review history — these are the platform saying 'we have already stood between you and the unknown.' The counter-offer mechanism provides relief through control: the host can reshape the terms of their vulnerability (shorter duration, different dates) without accepting or rejecting the person. On acceptance, the confirmation modal with specific dates and lease terms provides relief through concreteness: the unknown future is now a defined, bounded plan.",
        "failure_recovery": "If the host opens a proposal, becomes anxious, and closes the app without acting: the proposal remains in its original state on the dashboard. No 'You didn't respond!' alarm. After 12 hours, one gentle nudge. After 36 hours, a second. No further pressure. The host's psychological processing time is respected — rushing a decision that involves admitting a stranger into one's home is worse than a delayed response."

The pricing default IS that transcendent system. The host who accepts the default is performing what Becker calls 'embedding in other-power' — delegating the terror of self-valuation to the platform's authority. This should feel like relief, not defeat. The host who adjusts is performing what Becker calls 'flirtation with anxiety' — testing their own judgment within a safe range.

It is simply there, as if it always was. This 'already decided' presentation reduces the host's sense that a decision is needed at all. The acceptance animation (scale-up with spring easing) adds a subtle physical emphasis — the number becomes slightly larger, as if the platform is affirming 'Yes, this is right.' The slider, when used, moves smoothly with real-time price updates — creating a sense of continuous, controlled exploration rather than discrete, anxious choices.",

The 'Based on X similar rooms' trust line provides contextual relief — the host's space is being valued by comparison to peers, not in isolation. The guaranteed income projection provides security relief — the number connects the price to predictable, controllable revenue. The fee structure is hidden until after price acceptance (communicates-005, Tier 3) — this sequencing prevents the betrayal anxiety from contaminating the self-valuation moment. The acceptance animation provides closure relief — the brief scale-up is the period at the end of the sentence; the decision is made.",

The cleaning photo ritual is the host's self-preservation instinct given a concrete, completable form. During active lease, the host lives with chronic low-grade anxiety about their space — Is it being respected? Is it being damaged? Will it be returned as I left it? Each cleaning photo review answers these questions visually and definitively. The approval action is not administrative; it is the host performing a ritual confirmation that their hero system is intact.

These three elements (color shift, overlay, haptic) should create a compound moment of satisfaction that is brief (under 1 second total) but perceptually rich. No confetti, no celebration, no sound effect — the register is professional satisfaction, not party joy. The 48-hour persistence of the confirmed card in the reassurance zone provides an afterglow: each time the host opens the dashboard and sees the green-bordered, checkmarked card, the repression of space-invasion anxiety is re-engaged.",

The approval button converts the multi-photo visual assessment into a single, definitive action — all the micro-judgments ('kitchen looks fine, bathroom looks fine, bedroom looks fine') are consolidated into one conclusive 'Approve.' This compression of many small reliefs into one large relief creates the ritual satisfaction.",

      "target_emotion": "Informed equilibrium — the host should feel that everything is accounted for, nothing is slipping through the cracks, and the platform is watching alongside them. The emotion is not relaxation (the stranger is still in the home) but controlled vigilance — the equanimity of a pilot scanning instruments, not the anxiety of a parent checking a baby monitor.",
      "emotion_rationale": "Becker describes the 'strange power of living in the moment and ignoring and forgetting' — the 'grim equanimity' that comes from having a manageable world with clear routines. The active lease dashboard is this manageable world. During active lease, the host cannot truly relax — a stranger inhabits their hero system. But they can achieve equanimity if the platform provides a complete, current, trustworthy picture of the situation. The dashboard's emotional job is to convert the diffuse anxiety of 'stranger in my home' into the contained task-orientation of 'here are your action items, here is what's going well.' The urgency stack addresses threats; the reassurance zone sustains the vital lie. Together, they produce a state where the host's self-preservation instinct is satisfied without being alarmed.",

        "time_indicators": "'Due today,' '2 hours ago' (overdue), 'In 3 days' — specific, not vague. Not 'Soon' or 'When you can.' Temporal precision supports the host's sense of control.",

        "reassurance_content": "'$X,XXX earned this month,' 'Next arrival: [Guest Name], March 15,' 'Latest review: 5 stars from [Guest Name].' Each item is a data point of survival — financial, operational, reputational.",
        "empty_urgency_state": "'All caught up — nothing needs your attention right now.' Followed by the reassurance zone. This is the best possible dashboard state, and the copy should feel like a deep breath — permission to stop scanning.",
        "error_or_issue_state": "If a lease issue is in progress (support ticket, dispute): a dedicated card appears in the urgency stack with signal-info styling: '[Issue type] — support is handling this. Last update: [time].' The host must feel the platform is actively managing the issue, not passively recording it."
      },
      "animation_feel": "The dashboard's motion language is functional and steady. Urgency cards do not pulse, flash, or bounce — they are present and still, waiting to be addressed. The traffic-light left-border system (looks-003) provides the urgency signal through color, not motion. When an urgency card is resolved (e.g., cleaning photos approved), it transitions: the card smoothly slides down from the urgency stack to the reassurance zone over 400ms, border color shifting from warn/danger to accent green during the slide. This physical movement from 'urgent' to 'resolved' is the most emotionally significant animation on the dashboard — it is the visual enactment of threat-to-safety, and the host feels the relief of watching a task move from the worry list to the all-clear list. No other motion on the dashboard — scrolling reveals content, cards expand and collapse smoothly, but nothing moves unsolicited.",
      "tension_relief": {
        "tension_source": "The host lives with the chronic knowledge that a stranger occupies their sanctuary. Every day of active lease is a day the vital lie that 'I control my home' is tested. The dashboard is the host's primary mechanism for reasserting that control.",
        "relief_mechanism": "The urgency stack provides task-based relief: each completed action item is a micro-victory of control. The reassurance zone provides narrative relief: 'everything else is on track' tells the host their hero system is functioning. The 'all caught up' empty state provides the deepest relief: there are no threats, the system is working, the host can disengage temporarily. The card-slide animation from urgency to reassurance zone provides kinesthetic relief: the host watches the threat physically move to the safe zone.",
        "failure_recovery": "If the dashboard shows multiple overdue items (3+ red-bordered cards): the stack is ordered by severity but a summary line appears above: 'You have [X] items that need attention.' This prevents the host from being overwhelmed by a list of individual threats — the summary contains the anxiety in a single, manageable count. After addressing all items, the summary disappears and 'All caught up' appears — the full emotional reset."
