Possible causes: the income number does not feel impressive enough, the 'guests welcomed' framing does not resonate, or the review snippets are not sufficiently positive. If scroll depth is low (<60%), the page is too long or the hero income number is not compelling enough to motivate further reading.

The host should encounter it naturally when they next open the app after lease end. The income hero number should be the first element visible without scrolling.
