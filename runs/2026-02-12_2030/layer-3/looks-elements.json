      "problem": "When guests reschedule dates, they create invisible consequences for hosts (blocked dates, opportunity cost). Norman's research shows users cannot predict outcomes when system models are hidden. Brad has no feedback showing his rescheduling action blocks dates. The current calendar is monochromatic, treating all dates as equivalent. This visual uniformity hides the financial complexity beneath rescheduling decisions, making opportunity cost invisible to guests and creating host frustration that accumulates until policy changes.",
      "solution": "Use color-coded calendar visualization to make opportunity cost visible through instant recognition. GREEN dates: 'Your Feb 1-8 dates will become available for other guests' (opportunity recaptured). YELLOW dates: 'Your Feb 1-8 dates may remain blocked for 2-3 days' (neutral impact). RED dates: 'Your Feb 1-8 dates cannot be rebooked this season' (opportunity cost). The color system uses warm amber for warnings (not alarming red), forest green for positive outcomes (trust, growth), and warm neutrals for base states. This creates informative feedback without emotional manipulation, following taste model principle of 'warm, not cold.'",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_creation", "negotiation", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Norman's feedback research shows feedback must be immediate (under 0.1 second), yet digital interfaces often provide delayed or absent acknowledgment of user actions. When guests interact with date selectors, pricing calculators, or request submission buttons, absence of immediate visual response creates uncertainty: 'Did it work? Should I click again?' This uncertainty compounds anxiety during crisis moments (rescheduling under time pressure) and creates perception that platform is slow or unresponsive compared to instant conversational feedback from phone calls.",
      "solution": "Implement micro-animations for every interactive element following taste model animation philosophy: fast response (<100ms acknowledgment), gentle settle (300-500ms). Button press: scale down to 0.97 in 80ms (ease-out), settle back to 1.0 in 400ms (spring easing). Date selection: checkmark icon fades in over 200ms (ease-out) with subtle 5-degree rotation. Input field focus: border color transitions from border (ink-ghost) to accent in 150ms (ease-in-out) with subtle glow (0 0 0 4px accent at 20% opacity). Request submission: button content fades to spinner over 100ms, spinner rotates continuously (linear), success checkmark scales in from 0 to 1.0 over 400ms (spring). Never bounce—all easing is spring or ease-out for gentle, confident motion.",

In Split Lease, guests encounter multiple system images: Bryant's phone explanation, platform listing page, email notifications. Each uses different visual language. Phone call creates expectation for human warmth; generic platform UI feels cold and corporate by contrast. This fragmented system image forces guests to construct hybrid conceptual model that may be erroneous, increasing cognitive load and breaking trust transfer from human to digital touchpoint.",
      "solution": "Create consistent illustrative language across all touchpoints to unify system image. Use warm, hand-drawn-style illustrations with rounded, organic shapes that echo the 'warm, not cold' taste model. Color palette: accent green and surface-warm with ink-soft outlines. Illustration style: simplified geometric shapes (circles, rounded rectangles) suggesting people, buildings, and calendar elements—not photorealistic, not abstract icons, but approachable middle ground. Apply illustrations to: (1) Email headers showing Bryant's avatar with illustrated background, (2) Empty states on platform showing illustrated scenarios ('No proposals yet' with illustrated mailbox), (3) Listing page headers showing illustrated neighborhood context. Consistent stroke weight (2px) and corner radius (8px) across all illustrations creates visual rhythm that signals 'same system' across touchpoints.",
