      "problem": "Guests seeking flexible housing (hybrid workers, uncertain end dates) require rescheduling capabilities, but listings provide no signifier indicating whether rescheduling is possible, under what conditions, or at what cost. The affordance may exist (host may allow rescheduling), but without signifiers, guests cannot discover it during search or evaluation. This forces guests to book based on incomplete information, then negotiate flexibility informally via text after booking, where hidden complexity (seasonal pricing, replacement vs addition models, opportunity cost) creates conflict and relationship breakdown.",
      "solution": "Make rescheduling policy a visible, structured signifier in the listing. This requires: (1) A policy field where hosts declare whether they allow rescheduling, under what conditions (replacement only, addition allowed, advance notice required), and whether pricing adjusts seasonally. (2) A visual badge or icon on search results indicating 'Flexible Rescheduling' for listings that support it. (3) During listing evaluation, a clear explanation of the host's rescheduling terms using the host's conceptual model (replacement vs addition, seasonal pricing windows). (4) A calculator tool that lets guests preview the cost of rescheduling before booking, making the hidden variable (seasonal pricing) visible. Norman's principle: signifiers are more important to designers than affordances. Guests need signals, not just possibilities.",

When guests request schedule changes, they have no conceptual framework to understand why the same space costs different amounts at different times, or why adding dates triggers different pricing than replacing dates.

      "problem": "Pricing has hidden complexity: seasonal variation, replacement vs addition models, opportunity cost calculations, host policy boundaries. If all this complexity is presented during listing evaluation, guests face cognitive overload and abandon. If complexity is hidden until rescheduling negotiation, guests feel deceived when 'simple date swap' triggers unexpected price changes. Norman's refrigerator example shows how false conceptual models (two controls, two compartments implies independent controls) make systems impossible to use. Current pricing presentation creates false model (price = fixed property of listing), then violates that model during active use (price = seasonal variable + usage type).",
      "solution": "Use progressive disclosure to reveal pricing complexity only when contextually relevant, while maintaining conceptual model consistency. This means: (1) Listing evaluation shows simplified model: 'Starting at $1,170/month. Rates vary by season.' Calendar shows high-level seasonal ranges (winter, spring, summer, fall) without daily granularity. (2) Proposal creation shows precise pricing for selected dates with seasonal context: 'Jan 15 - Feb 15: $1,170/month (winter rates).' (3) Rescheduling interface reveals full complexity because now it's relevant: seasonal pricing comparison, replacement vs addition models, opportunity cost indicators. (4) Use consistent conceptual model language throughout: always frame as 'seasonal pricing' not 'dynamic pricing' or 'variable rates.' The model is: prices change predictably with seasons, not arbitrarily.",
