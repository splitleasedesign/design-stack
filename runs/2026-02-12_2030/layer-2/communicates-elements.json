Showing all complexity during listing evaluation causes cognitive overload and abandonment. Hiding complexity until negotiation creates perceived deception when 'simple date swap' triggers unexpected price changes. Norman's refrigerator example demonstrates how false conceptual models (displaying two independent controls when they're actually interdependent) make systems impossible to use. Current pricing presentation creates false model (price = fixed) then violates it during active use (price = seasonal variable).",

Show 'Starting at $1,170/month. Rates vary by season.' Simple calendar shows seasonal ranges (winter/spring/summer/fall), not daily granularity. Establishes mental model: prices are seasonal. TIER 2 (Proposal Creation): Precise disclosure for selected context. Show exact pricing for chosen dates with seasonal framing: 'Jan 15-Feb 15: $1,170/month (winter rates).' Guest sees their specific cost, understands it's tied to season. TIER 3 (Rescheduling): Full complexity disclosure when contextually essential.

Proposal creation includes helper text for each field. High information density, progressive disclosure via tooltips/expandable sections. EXPERT PATH (Returning guests, 3+ listings viewed): Information-minimal with density optimized for scanning. Listing shows: price range, rescheduling badge, key amenities in bullets. No explainers unless requested. Proposal creation pre-filled based on prior behavior, minimal helper text.

TOUCHPOINT CONSISTENCY: Bryant uses these exact terms in calls. Platform displays them in listings, proposals, and rescheduling flows. Host dashboard uses same vocabulary. Email notifications echo the language. Documentation and help center match.
