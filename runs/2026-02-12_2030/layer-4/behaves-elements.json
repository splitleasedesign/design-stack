      "problem": "Norman's research shows feedback must be immediate (under 0.1 second), yet rescheduling requests are inherently asynchronous requiring hours or days while hosts check availability and calculate pricing. Current system provides zero feedback—guest texts host and waits in silence, violating fundamental interaction principle of immediate acknowledgment. This creates anxiety during crisis moments when guest urgently needs housing certainty.",
      "solution": "Design five-stage progressive feedback system that provides immediate acknowledgment even when final decision is asynchronous. Stage 1 (0 seconds): instant confirmation with timeline expectation. Stage 2 (1-4 hours): automatic status when host views request. Stage 3 (4-12 hours): proactive check-in explaining delay if no decision. Stage 4 (decision point): clear outcome with pricing comparison. Stage 5 (post-decision): next action clarity. Each stage provides new information, maintaining communication flow during waiting period.",
