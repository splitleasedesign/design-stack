      "problem": "When guests must reschedule due to work schedule changes, they experience acute housing uncertainty: 'I can't make it' transforms secure housing into immediate crisis. Current system provides zero feedback during hours-long wait for host response, amplifying anxiety and creating perception that platform cannot handle urgent situations. Guest's emotional state: crisis (housing insecure) → anxiety (waiting in silence) → relief (decision received) → either gratitude (approved) or stress (denied, searching for alternatives). Platform currently provides no emotional support during crisis or acknowledgment of stress during wait.",
      "solution": "Design rescheduling flow to transform crisis emotion into certainty emotion through progressive emotional relief. Stage 1 (instant acknowledgment): target emotion is ASSURED. Copy: 'Request received. Nneka typically responds within 24 hours.' Reduces acute crisis to manageable waiting. Stage 2-3 (during wait): target emotion is INFORMED. Proactive updates explain what's happening, converting anxious silence into transparent process. Stage 4 (approval): target emotion is RELIEVED. Large serif 'Available' in green with immediate confirmation: 'Your housing is secure.' Stage 4 (denial): target emotion is SUPPORTED. Show alternatives immediately, preventing relief-to-stress whiplash. Timing is critical: acknowledgment under 1 second to meet crisis urgency, proactive update within 4 hours to prevent anxiety spiral.",

When guests interact with date pickers, pricing calculators, or buttons, absence of instant visual acknowledgment creates doubt: 'Did it work? Is it broken? Should I click again?' This uncertainty compounds during emotionally charged moments (crisis rescheduling) and creates perception that platform is inferior to human interaction, damaging trust in platform's ability to handle important tasks like housing.",

Date selection: checkmark fades in over 200ms. Input focus: border color transitions to accent in 150ms with subtle glow. Request submission: spinner appears in 100ms, success checkmark springs in over 400ms. Every action acknowledged under 100ms, creating perception that platform is instant and capable.
