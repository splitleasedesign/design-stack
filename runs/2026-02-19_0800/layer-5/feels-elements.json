      "problem": "Kris delegates because he doesn't want to manage the platform. But delegation creates a secondary anxiety: 'Is it actually being handled?' When Christiana can't log in, when photos are bad, when pricing isn't set — Kris's delegation confidence erodes. The emotional challenge is not getting Kris to engage more, but reassuring him that his delegation strategy is working. The Nudge book's 'status quo bias' connects: Kris's default is delegation, and any signal that delegation is failing triggers anxiety that undermines the status quo.",
      "solution": "Design a persistent 'it's handled' emotional signal. (1) Every agent action on behalf of the host generates a brief, positive notification: 'Bryant updated your photos' / 'Bryant set your recommended price.' These are not action items — they are reassurance signals. (2) The dashboard should show a 'Listing Health' indicator that stays green/purple as long as the agent is active. Kris doesn't need to know the details — he needs to know someone competent is managing. (3) Copy voice: Calm, factual, slightly warm. Like a good assistant reporting back. (4) Never ask Kris to 'review' or 'confirm' unless absolutely necessary. The emotional signal of 'review this' is 'something might be wrong,' which undermines delegation confidence.",

(1) First encounter with a matched guest: Show the guest's profile with verification badges that FEEL substantial — not a small icon, but a full verification card with specifics: 'Credit score verified. 3 landlord references checked. $X payment pre-authorized.' (2) During active lease: Show a running 'Stay Report' with guest check-in confirmation, cleaning photo submissions, and review snippets from other hosts. This creates a narrative of safety, not just a badge. (3) Copy voice for protection: Measured, specific, factual. Avoid vague reassurances ('Your property is safe!'). Use concrete specifics ('Guest credit check: Excellent. Previous host rating: 4.8/5. Payment pre-authorized: $X.'). (4) If something goes wrong: Communicate immediately with the same calm tone. 'We noticed [issue]. Your agent Bryant has been notified and will contact you within 1 hour.'",

The Nudge book's framing effect shows that how information is presented changes how it feels. 'You're gone 3 weeks a month' feels like absence. '21 bookable nights generating $X income' feels like opportunity. The platform must reframe the host's self-perception from 'person with a weird schedule' to 'owner of a premium, high-demand space.'",
      "solution": "Design a framing-based emotional shift. (1) When the host enters their schedule, immediately show an income projection: 'Your availability: 21 nights/month. Estimated monthly income: $X.' Use excited but grounded copy. (2) After first booking: Show a real-time earnings tracker that counts up, not a static number. The counting-up animation triggers the same positive emotion as a rising stock ticker. (3) Frame earnings relative to the host's known reference: 'This month covers 85% of your rent.' This reframes the income from abstract to meaningful. (4) Use warm visual language: Gold accent (#D4A853) for earnings displays. The color signals 'premium value,' not just 'money.'",
