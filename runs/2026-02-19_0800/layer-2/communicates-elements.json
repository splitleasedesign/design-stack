      "problem": "The platform's information hierarchy leads with income potential (pricing, earnings projections). But Kris's primary information need is protection: how guests are vetted, what guarantees exist, how his art and property are safeguarded. Loss aversion research shows protection concerns carry 2x the emotional weight of income gains. The current hierarchy inverts the premium host's actual decision priority, forcing them to scroll past income data to find the protection information they need to feel safe.",
      "solution": "Restructure the information hierarchy to lead with protection for premium hosts. (1) Evaluation page scan order: 'How we protect your property' banner > vetting process summary (credit check, references, guarantee) > guest quality stats ('94% of our guests are working professionals') > then income projection. (2) Active lease dashboard: Guest verification badge and protection status indicator appear in the top-left (first scan position), not hidden in a profile tab. (3) Use progressive disclosure: Protection summary always visible; detailed vetting report available on tap. Income details in a secondary tab. (4) Frame the payment guarantee as a protection feature, not an income feature: 'Your rent is protected' not 'Your income is guaranteed.'",

The platform's current pricing step presents a blank field, requiring the host to anchor on their own number (which may be their rent, a guess, or an Airbnb comparison). Thaler and Sunstein show that anchors — even arbitrary ones — profoundly shape decisions. The platform must provide the right anchor before asking for input, or hosts will anchor on wrong numbers.",
      "solution": "Display comparable listing data before revealing the price input field. (1) Show 3-5 comparable listings in the host's area with their nightly rates, occupancy rates, and key features. (2) Highlight the recommended price as a large, prominent number above the input field — this becomes the anchor. (3) Show the host's cost basis ($5,500/mo) alongside the recommended nightly rate and calculate the implied ROI: 'At $X/night, your expected monthly income covers your rent and earns $Y extra.' (4) Frame the price relative to the host's rent, not relative to abstract market data. Kris thinks in terms of $5,500/mo — show him how the nightly rate maps to that frame.",

      "problem": "Information discussed on the phone call (property details, pricing expectations, schedule, concerns) does not persist into the platform experience. When Kris or Christiana logs in, the platform has no memory of what Bryant discussed. This creates an information gap: the host must re-enter or re-discover information that was already exchanged. The Nudge book emphasizes that choice architecture is inevitable — the platform's choice to show a blank dashboard instead of a call-informed dashboard is itself a choice that communicates 'we don't know you.'",
      "solution": "Bridge call information to platform display. (1) After an agent call, the platform should show a 'Your agent noted' section at the top of the dashboard with key call outcomes: recommended price, schedule captured, photos needed, concerns logged. (2) Agent name and photo visible on the dashboard — the platform inherits trust from the person. (3) Call-derived data pre-populates relevant fields: schedule from call notes fills the availability calendar; pricing discussion fills the recommended rate; property details fill listing description. (4) If any information is missing, the platform asks for it in the context of the call: 'Bryant mentioned your apartment has a rooftop — would you like to add photos of the rooftop to your listing?'",

The platform must reframe this information: Kris's 3-week absences are not empty weeks — they are 21 bookable nights per month. The Nudge book's framing effect shows that how information is presented changes decisions. 'You're away 3 weeks' feels passive. '21 nights available per month at $X/night = $Y/month' feels actionable. The platform's information architecture must translate the host's personal frame into a value frame.",

(1) Calendar view: Show Kris's schedule with his language ('Away: Feb 21 - Mar 14') but overlay the income calculation ('21 available nights = $X potential income'). (2) At listing creation: When the host enters their schedule, immediately show the income potential of that schedule. Don't wait for pricing to show value. (3) At proposal matching: Frame incoming proposals against the host's schedule: 'Guest request: Feb 22 - Mar 10 (17 of your 21 available nights). Potential income: $X.'
