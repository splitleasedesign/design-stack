      "problem": "Every decision point on the platform currently requires explicit multi-step confirmation: review options, select one, confirm, possibly re-confirm. For a delegator-host like Kris who wants to accept defaults, this interaction cost is a tax on the behavior the platform should encourage. The Nudge book shows that making the right choice easy (one button click) dramatically increases adoption. But pure one-tap risks accidental actions. The solution is optimistic action with undo — accept the default instantly, provide a brief undo window for errors.",
      "solution": "Implement an optimistic acceptance pattern for defaults and recommendations. (1) Default acceptance is one tap: 'Accept recommended price' or 'Accept proposal' — single button, immediate confirmation. (2) After acceptance, show a 5-second toast notification with 'Undo' button. The toast uses --secondary-purple background with white text. (3) After the undo window closes, the action is committed. No additional confirmation modal. (4) For high-stakes actions (accepting a guest for the first time), extend the undo window to 30 seconds and add a brief summary of what was accepted. (5) The undo button is visually prominent: white text on purple, right-aligned in the toast, minimum 48px touch target.",

(2) Kris taps the link, authenticates via phone number (SMS code — no password required), and sees a simplified dashboard: listing preview, pending proposals, earnings summary, and protection status. (3) The proxy view is read-heavy, action-light: Kris can approve/decline proposals and view but not edit the listing. Editing remains with the account holder.

For Kris, who wants 'one or two regular' guests, this forced re-decision at each lease end fights his natural status quo bias. The Nudge book's pension study shows that when the default is 'continue,' the median number of changes is zero. The platform should harness this by making renewal the default, requiring action only to change or stop.",
      "solution": "Design a status-quo-preserving renewal flow. (1) Default behavior: 30 days before lease end, send a notification: 'Your lease with [Guest] renews on [date] at the same terms. No action needed.' (2) If both parties take no action, the lease auto-renews. (3) To change terms, the host taps 'Modify terms' — which opens a lightweight adjustment screen (slider for price, date picker for schedule changes). (4) To end the lease, the host must tap 'End lease' which triggers a brief confirmation: 'Are you sure? [Guest] has been a great tenant for [N] months.' This is deliberate friction for the non-default choice. (5) The visual treatment: 'Renews automatically' is shown in calm, confident purple. 'End lease' is shown in muted gray, de-emphasized.",
