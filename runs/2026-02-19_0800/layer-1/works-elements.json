When the platform fails to provide defaults, hosts either abandon (depleted decision-makers default to denial) or accept random/poor outcomes. The current listing wizard starts blank; the pricing field starts blank; the proposal response requires active engagement. Every blank field is a choice architecture failure.",
      "solution": "Pre-fill every decision point with an intelligent default that produces a good outcome if accepted without modification. (1) Pricing: Pre-fill with a recommended nightly rate based on location comps, property type, and schedule. Show the default prominently with a 'Recommended' label and allow adjustment via slider, not blank input. (2) Listing details: Pre-populate from agent call notes and property address data (neighborhood description, nearby transit, building type). (3) Proposal response: Default to 'Accept' for proposals within the host's stated parameters, with a 'Review details' option rather than requiring active acceptance. (4) Lease renewal: Default to auto-renewal with the same guest, requiring opt-out rather than opt-in. Each default must be the choice a well-informed, attentive host would make.",

This three-person collaboration (property owner + account manager + agent) is forced through a single-user account model.

This creates a fragile dependency — if Christiana is unavailable, the listing stalls. The Nudge book warns that 'seemingly arbitrary decisions will have subtle influences on how the people who use the building interact.' The single-user account model is one such arbitrary decision with major downstream consequences.",

(1) Owner role: The property owner (Kris) can view the listing, receive proposals, approve guests, and see earnings — even if they did not create the account. Access via a simple invite link, no separate account creation required. (2) Manager role: The account holder (Christiana) can edit listings, manage photos, handle logistics. (3) Agent role: The assigned agent (Bryant) can edit photos, adjust pricing, and manage proposals on behalf of the host — with visibility but not ownership. (4) Each role receives appropriate notifications. The owner gets decision-requiring items (proposals, reviews). The manager gets operational items (photo requests, schedule changes).

(2) During active lease: Surface guest quality signals prominently — verified status, reviews from other hosts, credit check completion.

(3) During onboarding: Allow hosts to flag high-value assets (art, electronics, furniture) and receive a custom protection recommendation.
