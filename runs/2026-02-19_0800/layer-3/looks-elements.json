      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "listing_creation", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Kris describes a premium property (57th St between Park & Lex, 11.5ft ceilings, rooftop, art collection). But the platform's visual language treats all listings the same — same card layouts, same typography, same badge system. Premium hosts need a visual language that mirrors the quality of their property and communicates trust at the level they expect. The Nudge book's concept of 'everything matters' applies to visual design: the visual quality of the platform is itself a choice architecture signal. A premium host seeing a generic interface will question whether the platform can attract premium guests.",
      "solution": "Create a premium visual tier for high-value listings. (1) Use the deep purple palette (#31135D) for premium listing cards — this signals sophistication without adding new colors. (2) Typography shift: Use DM Sans at 600 weight for premium listing headlines (slightly more refined than Inter). (3) Photo treatment: Premium listings get full-bleed hero photos with the subtle purple gradient overlay from the style guide (--gradient-purple-dark). (4) Trust badges for premium listings: 'Verified Premium Property' using a gold/amber accent against the purple palette (use --accent-gold #D4A853 from proposed palette). (5) Spacing increases: Premium cards use --spacing-3xl padding instead of --spacing-2xl, giving content room to breathe — matching the 11.5ft ceilings Kris describes.",

      "journey_phases": ["pricing", "listing_creation", "proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "When the platform provides a default or recommendation (pricing, listing details, proposal response), the visual treatment must clearly signal 'this is the recommended choice' without appearing manipulative. The Nudge book's taxi tipping example shows that pre-calculated options with clear visual anchoring outperform blank inputs. But overly aggressive anchoring (like the 30% tip default) triggers reactance. The visual balance between 'clearly recommended' and 'not pushy' is critical.",
      "solution": "Design a recommendation visual pattern. (1) The recommended option is displayed in a card with --secondary-purple border (2px, using --border-width-thick) and a subtle purple-tinted background (--bg-off-white). Alternative options use --border-color (standard gray) and --bg-white. (2) A small 'Recommended' badge in --secondary-purple with white text appears above the recommended card — never inside the card to avoid clutter. (3) The recommended number (price, date, etc.) uses --text-2xl (28px) and --font-weight-bold. Alternatives use --text-lg (18px) and --font-weight-medium. Size difference creates visual hierarchy without aggressive framing. (4) Allow one-tap acceptance of the recommended option and require additional taps for alternatives — friction as nudge.",

For a loss-averse premium host, this visual absence IS the message: 'your property is not protected.'",
      "solution": "Create a consistent protection visual system. (1) Protection status uses a distinct visual treatment: a shield icon (Feather icon 'shield') paired with a status color — --secondary-purple for 'fully protected,' --status-warning (#C4841D from proposed tokens) for 'action needed.' (2) The protection indicator appears in a fixed position on the active lease dashboard — top-right corner, always visible, never scrolls away. (3) Guest verification cards use a vertical purple stripe on the left edge (4px, --secondary-purple) to visually distinguish them from general information cards. (4) On hover/tap, the shield icon expands to show the full protection summary: credit check status, references verified, payment guarantee active, insurance level.",

(4) Agent photo uses a subtle purple ring (2px --secondary-purple border) to visually distinguish from guest photos.
