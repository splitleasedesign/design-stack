      "similarity": "Both prescribe smart defaults as the primary UX pattern. The existing element frames defaults through ego depletion (Kahneman's parole judge study). The new element frames defaults through choice architecture (Thaler & Sunstein's opt-out vs opt-in research). Same prescription, different theoretical lens.",
      "combined_evidence": "Kahneman evidence: depleted judges default to denial. Nudge evidence: opt-out designs increase participation by 25%+. Kris evidence: explicitly asks for a pricing recommendation rather than making his own choice. Combined: Smart defaults work because users are both depleted AND behaviorally biased toward status quo — two independent mechanisms reinforcing the same design pattern.",

The new element frames it as choice architecture encoding (Thaler agent-as-designer). Both require the agent's call outputs to persist into the platform.",
      "combined_evidence": "Existing evidence: platform arrives as an unprimed stimulus; the agent must prime the digital experience during the call. New evidence: Bryant's recommendations (pricing, photos, scheduling) are ephemeral call outputs that the platform never captures. Combined: The agent must both prime the host for the platform AND encode their choice architecture into the platform. These are two sides of the same bridge.",

This run independently discovers the same pattern through Kris's art anxiety and the Nudge book's 2:1 loss aversion ratio.",

The new element applies it to guest relationships (recurring guests as default). Both use the same cognitive principle: continuity reduces cognitive cost.",

These are not contradictory per se, but they create a tonal tension: excitement is forward-leaning and energizing; safety is grounding and calming. The dashboard must balance both without creating emotional whiplash.",
      "evidence_comparison": "Both are well-evidenced. The safety emotion has stronger evidence from the call (Kris's art anxiety is more visceral than his income curiosity). Safety should take visual priority, with excitement as a secondary emotional layer.",

The primary through-line is CONFIDENCE, which makes sense for a delegator-host who needs to feel that everything is handled. Safety peaks during active lease (when the host's property is occupied). Excitement is a secondary thread tied to income milestones. The arc avoids negative emotions (urgency, anxiety, pressure) which aligns with the delegator persona. Overall: sound."
