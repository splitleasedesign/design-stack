      "similarity": "Both address the gap between what the platform shows and what the user needs to understand. The library's System 1 Trust Gate focuses on visual/associative coherence at transitions. This run's Self-Articulating UI focuses on verbal/rational coherence at decision points. Together they form a complete principle: the UI must pass both the automatic first-impression test (System 1) AND the deliberate comprehension test (System 2 via articulation).",
      "combined_evidence": "Library: phase transitions must signal continuity through visual consistency. New: every decision point must include rationale ('why this works this way'). Combined: the guest needs both visual trust (looks right) and verbal trust (explains itself).",

This run's element adds the dollar-value dimension — showing the concrete financial impact of each cleaning submission.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library: streak counter transforms obligation into pride via 'reward of the self.' New: savings counter transforms obligation into smart economics via visible dollar value. Combined: the weekly cleaning flow should show BOTH the streak (pride) and the savings (economics) — they serve different psychological needs.",

      "combined_evidence": "Library: agent-named emails feel personal and trustworthy. New: ALL status messages should name the agent and use first person.

      "combined_evidence": "Library: timeline format with dots gives structure to the between-stay period. New: pipeline format with nodes gives structure to the matching wait period.

The System 1 Trust Gate warns against introducing unfamiliar UI patterns that trigger threat detection. A comparison table on the homepage could feel like a marketing pitch rather than a trusted platform — potentially triggering System 1 rejection if it looks like an ad.",
      "evidence_comparison": "The comparison approach is strongly evidenced by Theodore's call (he literally couldn't distinguish SplitLease from Airbnb). The System 1 concern is theoretical at discovery phase. Recommendation: keep the comparison but ensure it doesn't LOOK like an ad (no marketing colors, no stock photos, just clean data).",
