      "problem": "Theodore's biggest anxiety was committing without seeing the space (04:07). The agent resolved it with a 3-step explanation: (1) sign lease, (2) 24-hour inspection, (3) full refund if unsatisfied. But this protection model is buried in terms or absent from the listing page entirely. Greever's 'set the context' principle (Ch 3) says the most important information must be presented before asking for commitment.",
      "solution": "Reveal the protection model progressively across phases: On listing pages, show a compact 'Protection Shield' with icons for each safeguard. On proposal confirmation, expand to show the full 3-step process. On acceptance, show a timeline of what happens next. The information architecture follows Greever's 'optimize for memory' — each phase reinforces the same 3 protections with increasing detail. Never make the guest feel unprotected at a decision point.",

'Your proposal tells hosts you're interested and at what price — they can accept, counter, or pass.' (2) How does it affect you? 'You'll hear back within 5-7 days. No obligation until you both agree.' (3) Why is it better? 'Unlike bidding wars, we match you 1:1 with compatible hosts.'

The agent spent 2 minutes explaining the core differentiator: no short-term occupancy taxes, minimum 6 weeks, split scheduling (06:22-06:53).
