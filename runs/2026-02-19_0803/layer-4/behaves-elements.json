      "problem": "Theodore objected to signing before seeing the apartment (04:07). The agent resolved it in real-time. The UI cannot have real-time conversations, so it must anticipate the objection and present the reframe at exactly the right moment — when the guest encounters the unfamiliar process. Current tooltip/popover patterns are informational, not persuasive.",
      "solution": "Implement contextual reframing tooltips that trigger at known objection points: (1) When the guest first encounters '24-hour inspection' language, show a non-modal tooltip anchored to the term with the Airbnb reframe. (2) Tooltip appears on first encounter, then auto-collapses to an info icon on return visits. (3) The tooltip should feel like a conversation, not a help article: 'Think about it like Airbnb — nobody sees the apartment before booking. But with us, you get 24 hours and your money back if it's not right.' (4) Dismissing the tooltip marks the objection as resolved — it won't reappear.",

      "journey_phases": ["negotiation"],
      "problem": "After submitting a bid, Theodore enters a 2-3 week void with zero feedback (08:40). The matching process is batched weekly, meaning real updates happen in bursts separated by days of silence. The UI must fill this void with meaningful status without fabricating progress. Greever's 'follow up fast' principle (Ch 9) applies: any communication is better than silence.",
      "solution": "Create a live tracker that combines real events with contextual information: (1) Default state shows the pipeline at 'Agent Review' with timestamp of last activity. (2) When batched matching runs, update to 'Scanning hosts with compatible schedules...' (3) Show partial results as they emerge: '3 potential matches found — your agent is reviewing compatibility.' (4) Include estimated next update time: 'Next matching batch: Monday.' (5) Between batches, show contextual content: 'While you wait: 4 new listings in Manhattan match your weekend pattern.' This keeps the page alive without fabricating progress.",
