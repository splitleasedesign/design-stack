      "problem": "The 24-hour protection model, security deposit held by SplitLease, and refund guarantee are the most persuasive trust signals in the guest journey (Theodore's entire call turned on these). But there's no visual language for financial protection. Trust signals compete with pricing, listing details, and photos for visual attention. Greever notes that 'being articulate imparts intelligence' — the visual treatment of protection must feel authoritative, not decorative.",
      "solution": "Create a 'Protection Shield' visual system: (1) A shield icon with 3 horizontal stripes (one per protection layer) in gradient purple. (2) Place it on a subtle off-white background (--bg-off-white) with a thin purple border. (3) Use DM Sans semibold for the protection labels — slightly softer than Inter to convey care rather than corporate authority. (4) Each protection point gets a checkmark icon in secondary purple. The visual weight should be equivalent to the price display — protection and price are co-primary.",

      "problem": "The UI currently presents information in two modes: headlines (big, bold) and body text (small, gray). But articulation microcopy — the conversational 'why this works this way' explanations — doesn't fit either mode. It needs to feel like the agent speaking, not like documentation or marketing. Greever distinguishes between 'what the design does' and 'why it's the right choice' — these require different visual treatments.",
      "solution": "Create a distinct visual treatment for articulation microcopy: (1) Use a subtle background tint (--bg-off-white or rgba(49,19,93,0.04)) to visually separate it from standard content. (2) Set in Inter 400, 13px, --text-description (#374151) — conversational weight, not instructional. (3) Maximum 2 lines. (4) Preceded by a small icon (info-circle or lightbulb in --text-light-gray). (5) Rounded corners (--rounded-lg, 8px) on the background container. This creates a 'quiet voice' that the eye can find when needed but doesn't compete with primary content.",
