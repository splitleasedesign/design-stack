      "problem": "Theodore responded most positively when the agent said 'I am your concierge' (10:45) and 'we pay a lot of attention to our customers being happy' (10:49-11:01). The UI has no equivalent emotional warmth — it's functional but impersonal. The gap between the agent's warm, personal tone and the platform's transactional interface creates an emotional drop-off when the guest moves from phone to screen.",
      "solution": "Infuse the agent's concierge tone into UI copy throughout the pre-lease journey. (1) Replace 'Submit Proposal' with 'Send Your Interest'. (2) Replace 'Matching in progress' with 'Robert is finding your best options.' (3) Replace 'No results found' with 'We haven't found your perfect match yet — Robert is expanding the search.' (4) Every status update should name the agent, use first person, and communicate care. The emotional target: the guest should feel like the app is Robert speaking to them, not a system processing them.",
