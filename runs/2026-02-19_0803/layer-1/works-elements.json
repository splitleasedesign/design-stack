      "problem": "Theodore's 14-minute call consisted entirely of the agent explaining things the UI should communicate: what SplitLease is (00:24), how bids work (07:35), why you can't see the apartment first (04:17), and what the 40% discount requires (12:43). The UI currently relies on human agents to 'articulate its design decisions' — the very failure Greever's book identifies as the #1 reason designs fail to get support. Every screen has information but lacks rationale.",
      "solution": "Every critical UI element must include its own 'why' — not just what it shows, but why it works this way. Implement 'articulation microcopy' at every decision point: (1) Next to the 24-hour inspection model, show 'Why do we do this? Same reason Airbnb doesn't show apartments before booking — but we give you 24 hours and a full refund.' (2) Next to the bid submission, show 'This tells us you're interested and your budget — we'll match you with hosts whose schedule complements yours.' (3) On discovery, show 'Not Airbnb. Not a lease. The affordable middle: 6+ week stays, split by days of the week, at 40-60% less than short-term rentals.' The pattern: information + articulation = understanding.",

      "problem": "Theodore's biggest objection was not seeing the apartment before signing (04:07-04:20).

That's a good point.' (04:50). The UI currently explains policies but doesn't reframe them. Explaining says 'here's how it works.' Reframing says 'it works like something you already trust.'",

(1) 24-hour inspection → 'Like Airbnb, but with a 24-hour satisfaction guarantee and full refund option.' (2) Bid/proposal system → 'Think of it like making an offer on a rental — you tell us what works for you, we find the match.'

During this time, the platform does significant work (batched matching, schedule analysis, host outreach), but the guest sees NOTHING. Greever identifies this as a severity-CRITICAL communication gap: 'Follow up fast' and 'Do something, even if it's wrong' (Ch 9). The guest's only update mechanism is calling the agent. Meanwhile, Airbnb provides instant booking confirmation. The 2-3 week silent period is the highest-severity dropout risk in the guest journey.",

(1) Upon bid submission, show a matching pipeline visualization: 'Your preferences → Scanning hosts → Filtering schedules → Ranking matches → Agent review → Introduction.' (2) Send weekly progress updates: 'We reviewed 12 potential hosts this week. 3 have compatible schedules. Your agent Robert is reviewing the best options.' (3) Show partial results early: 'We found 2 strong matches for your Friday-Sunday pattern in Manhattan. Your agent will reach out by Wednesday.'

Over 16 weeks of active lease, the guest does chores and accepts schedule flexibility without any ongoing reminder of what this effort is worth. Greever says 'managing expectations' is essential (Ch 10) — but here the expectation was set once and never reinforced. After week 4, the discount feels like an obligation rather than a bargain.",
      "solution": "At every weekly stay, show the guest a running 'Value Tracker' that articulates the bargain: (1) 'This week you saved $X by keeping the space clean and being flexible with your schedule.'

Most existing UI elements (day-badge selectors, match cards) are optimized for weekday patterns because most guests are hybrid workers.
