      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "Each guest arrival disrupts the host's solitude; each departure restores it. These transitions are the highest-anxiety micro-moments in the host's week. Csikszentmihalyi describes how Susan Butcher's 'routines demand that her consciousness be focused on manageable tasks all of the time -- thereby making life a continuous flow experience' (lines 420-422). Without structured transition rituals, the host's consciousness wanders: 'Is the guest coming? Did they leave the space clean? When exactly are they arriving?' This is the psychic entropy of unstructured social transition -- 'worries are always hovering at the periphery of attention' (lines 210-212). The journey map specifies that guests notify arrival and send cleaning photos, but the host-side interaction pattern for receiving and acknowledging these signals is unspecified. The host currently receives raw notifications (a message saying 'I am arriving') without a structured response pattern. This lack of ritual produces the 'unstructured solitude' Csikszentmihalyi warns is so difficult to manage (lines 197-202) -- except here it is unstructured social transitions that generate the entropy.",
      "solution": "Design arrival and departure as structured interaction rituals with clear host actions that bookend each stay cycle. Arrival ritual: when the guest sends an arrival notification, the host receives a compact card in the Stays Manager with the guest's arrival message, the arrival time, and a one-tap acknowledgment button: 'Got it -- welcome.' Tapping the button sends a confirmation to the guest and transitions the corresponding day on the rhythm strip from 'transition' to 'guest-present.' The acknowledgment is the ritual act -- a small, concrete action that structures the transition from solitude to shared space. Departure ritual: when the guest sends cleaning photos, the host receives a card with the photos displayed as a compact gallery (tappable thumbnails) and a one-tap acknowledgment: 'Looks good' or a 'Note to guest' text option for issues. Acknowledging transitions the rhythm strip day from 'guest-present' to 'guest-absent' and triggers the per-stay micro-review prompt. The departure acknowledgment is the second ritual act -- it formally returns the space to the host's solitude. Both rituals are time-bounded: if the host does not acknowledge within 4 hours, the system acknowledges automatically and notifies the host: 'Your guest arrived -- you can review anytime.' This prevents the ritual from becoming an obligation. The rituals' emotional function is Csikszentmihalyi's 'structuring time' principle: they convert anxiety-laden transitions into predictable, manageable micro-actions.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "When a host wants to modify a proposal's terms, the current interaction is a rejection-and-resubmission pattern: decline the original, send new terms. Csikszentmihalyi describes Mark's encounter with robbers (lines 139-168) as an example of how 'a social situation has the potential to be transformed by redefining its rules' (lines 160-162). The counter-proposal should embody this principle -- the host is not rejecting the guest but creatively redefining the arrangement to match their own flow parameters. However, a decline-and-resubmit interaction feels like rejection, not transformation. The guest receives a decline notification, which triggers anxiety and potential abandonment, even if new terms follow immediately. The user stories confirm that 'a vague or incomplete proposal creates friction' -- and a rejection notification is the ultimate friction. The interaction must preserve the relational warmth of the proposal exchange while giving the host creative control over the terms.",
      "solution": "Design the counter-proposal as an in-place editing interaction on the proposal card, not as a separate action. When the host taps 'Suggest changes' on the proposal card, the terms column becomes editable. Each field (dates, duration, nights per week, price) transforms from display to input with a smooth visual transition (border appears, background shifts to accent-light at 5% opacity, 200ms ease-out). As the host adjusts any field, the impact is calculated and displayed inline below the changed field: 'Changing from 16 to 10 weeks reduces total income by $5,100 but gives you 6 fewer weeks of hosting.' A personal message field appears at the bottom, pre-populated with: 'I would love to host you with a small adjustment --' (editable). The guest's social profile remains visible in the right column throughout editing, maintaining the social context. When the host taps 'Send suggestion,' the system sends the modified proposal to the guest as a 'Host suggestion' -- not as a counter-offer, not as a rejection. The guest receives: 'Jessica made an adjustment to your proposal' with the side-by-side comparison. The interaction frames the host as a creative collaborator, not a gatekeeper.",

      "problem": "The Stays Manager is visited 13+ times during a 3-month lease. Csikszentmihalyi's central warning applies: 'One cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long. We grow either bored or frustrated' (derived from lines 728-735 on relationship staleness). If the Stays Manager presents identical interactions on visit 1 and visit 13, the host emotionally disengages by mid-lease. Their hosting skill grows with each visit (they know the layout, understand the payment cycle, have navigated date changes), but the interaction complexity remains flat. Csikszentmihalyi explicitly addresses this dynamic in families: 'boredom and frustration will inevitably set in, and then the relationship is likely to break up unless there are strong external factors keeping it together' (lines 654-655). The 'strong external factor' for the host is the lease contract -- but Csikszentmihalyi argues this extrinsic binding cannot sustain enjoyment. The user stories' urgency-first principle addresses what to show, but not how the Stays Manager evolves over time.",

The layout skeleton (rhythm strip at top, main content area, reference footer) remains identical across all phases -- preserving the 'clarity' from Csikszentmihalyi's autotelic family context. Only the content within each zone changes. Phase 1 -- Orientation (Weeks 1-3): the main content area features a getting-started checklist with interactive items: 'Review House Manual with guest in mind,' 'Confirm arrival notification process,' 'Send a welcome message.' Each item is a tap-to-complete interaction with a satisfying check animation. The checklist provides low-challenge, high-feedback interactions that match the host's low platform skill. Phase 2 -- Rhythm (Weeks 4-9): the checklist is replaced by per-stay micro-review prompts, a date-change management tool (if any requests are pending), and a stay-cycle progress visualization. The progress visualization shows completed cycles as accent-filled segments in a horizontal bar, with the current cycle highlighted. Tapping a completed segment reveals that cycle's review and guest feedback. Phase 3 -- Reflection (Weeks 10-13): new interactions surface: a cumulative review composition prompt ('Write a final review of your hosting experience'), a lease renewal consideration card with comparison data, and a forward-looking challenge card (from L2's growth narrative). Phase transitions happen silently -- no 'Phase 2 unlocked!' notification. New content appears naturally on the next visit as the calendar advances.",

Static rules set before the host has experienced actual cohabitation become stale or irrelevant. A rule about 'quiet after 10pm' may prove unnecessary when the guest is out every evening. A missing rule about kitchen cleanup may become critical after three messy stays. The user stories identify that 'Pause preserves the work' -- the host's investment in listing content should persist and evolve. But the House Manual's investment is lost if it cannot be updated based on lived experience. Csikszentmihalyi's family dynamics apply: 'without concentration, a complex activity breaks down into chaos' (line 870).

Each section (house rules, space description, neighborhood tips) has an 'Edit' affordance visible only to the host. (2) Editing uses inline text editing -- the host taps a section, the text becomes editable with a subtle background shift (same pattern as counter-proposal editing), and a 'Save & notify guest' button appears. (3) When the host saves a change, the guest receives a notification: 'Your host updated the House Manual -- [section name] changed.' The notification links directly to the changed section with the modification highlighted. (4) A change log is maintained at the bottom of the House Manual, showing when each section was last updated. This gives both parties confidence that the document reflects the current arrangement, not the pre-lease assumptions.

Csikszentmihalyi frames this through the solitude lens: 'Every rule has its exceptions, and even though most people dread solitude, there are some individuals who live alone by choice' (lines 367-368). A host who pauses their listing is choosing solitude -- retreating from the social complexity of hosting to recover their private equilibrium. This is Csikszentmihalyi's 'taming solitude' in action: the host has decided that their current capacity for social engagement is depleted, and they need time alone. The platform must honor this as a healthy, natural part of the hosting rhythm -- not as a failure or abandonment. But the current interaction around pausing may feel like giving up. And the return interaction -- reactivating after a pause -- may feel like starting over. Both feelings work against the host's willingness to pause when they need to and return when they are ready.",
      "solution": "Design pause as a dignified, one-tap action with full state preservation, and return as an equally effortless one-tap reactivation with a welcoming status summary. Pause interaction: a 'Pause listing' button in the listing management view, visually neutral (surface background, ink-soft text, border outline -- not red, not warning-colored). Tapping it opens a brief confirmation: 'Your listing will be hidden from search. All your work -- photos, rules, pricing -- is preserved. You can bring it back anytime.' A single 'Pause' button confirms. The listing card on the host's dashboard shows a 'Paused' badge in ink-muted with a subtle clock icon. Return interaction: the paused listing card shows a 'Reactivate' button in accent. Tapping it opens a brief status summary: 'Your listing is ready to go live. Here is what has changed since you paused: [number] days paused, [any platform changes]. Review or go live now.' Two options: 'Review listing' (opens the wizard at the first step with all data preserved) or 'Go live' (reactivates immediately). The emotional principle: pausing is resting, not quitting. Returning is resuming, not restarting. Csikszentmihalyi: 'unless a person learns to enjoy [solitude], much of life will be spent desperately trying to avoid its ill effects' (lines 474-476). A host who can pause without penalty learns to enjoy the oscillation between hosting and solitude.",
