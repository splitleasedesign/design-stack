      "journey_phases": ["listing_creation", "active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "The host's entire journey is a continuous negotiation between solitude and social presence, but the platform provides no tools for managing this oscillation. Csikszentmihalyi opens Chapter 8 by establishing the paradox: 'Whether we are in the company of other people or not makes a great difference to the quality of experience' (lines 30-31), and warns that 'unless one learns to tolerate and even enjoy being alone, it is very difficult to accomplish any task that requires undivided concentration' (lines 44-46). The host who lists a room has voluntarily disrupted their solitude, but the disruption is not binary -- it oscillates. During active lease, the guest is present on specific days and absent on others. The Date Change Tool controls dates but not the psychological rhythm. A host who has no visibility into when they will have solitude versus company cannot maintain the 'order in the mind' that Csikszentmihalyi identifies as essential. The user stories confirm the host needs urgency-first surfacing: 'Unread proposals, pending actions -- that's what a host needs to see the moment they log in.' But the missing piece is temporal rhythm visibility: when is the guest here, when am I alone, how does my week look? Without this, the host experiences the 'psychic entropy' of unstructured social expectation -- 'worries about one's love life, health, investments, family, and job are always hovering at the periphery of attention, waiting until there is nothing pressing that demands concentration' (lines 210-212). The host's version: 'Is the guest coming tonight? Did they confirm? Will I have the kitchen to myself this morning?'",
      "solution": "Build a solitude-companionship rhythm view into the host's Stays Manager that makes the oscillation between privacy and sharing visible, predictable, and controllable. Specifically: (1) A weekly rhythm strip showing which days the guest is present (filled segments) and which the host has to themselves (open segments), updated in real time based on confirmed stays. This converts the abstract anxiety of 'when will they be here?' into concrete, scannable information. (2) Arrival and departure notification rituals that structure transitions: the guest's arrival notification triggers a brief host-side acknowledgment ('Guest arriving today'), and the cleaning photos at departure trigger a 'space returned' confirmation. These rituals are what Csikszentmihalyi describes Dorothy doing in her cabin: structuring time to prevent entropy (lines 396-398). (3) The Date Change Tool should surface the solitude-companionship impact of any proposed change: 'This change gives you 3 consecutive days alone instead of 1.' The host evaluates date changes not just as scheduling logistics but as privacy management. (4) During listing creation, the House Rules step should include a 'quiet hours' and 'private spaces' section that lets the host articulate their solitude boundaries before the guest arrives -- this is the differentiation work Csikszentmihalyi describes: 'each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits, maximize personal skills, set individual goals' (lines 668-669). The host's unique trait is how they balance solitude and company.",

      "title": "Differentiation Wizard: Listing Creation as Structured Self-Expression",
      "journey_phases": ["listing_creation", "pricing"],
      "problem": "Listing creation asks the host to perform what Csikszentmihalyi calls differentiation -- 'each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits, maximize personal skills, set individual goals' (lines 668-669) -- but the 6-step wizard treats this as a data-entry exercise. The host must translate intimate knowledge of their space (what it feels like to live here) into the platform's categories (number of bedrooms, parking type). This is a challenge that exceeds most hosts' skills not because they lack knowledge but because they have never articulated their living environment to a stranger. Csikszentmihalyi describes Dorothy who 'personalized her surroundings to an uncommon degree' with 'flower tubs, garden gnomes, discarded tools' (lines 386-388). Every host has similarly personalized their space, but the listing wizard does not help them express this personalization -- it asks for facts (square footage) when the host's real differentiation is qualitative (my quiet mornings, my garden, the way light comes through the kitchen window). The user stories confirm: 'Completion percentage is a good host nudge. Hosts need to know what's unfinished before a listing goes live.' But completion is only feedback on quantity (how many fields filled), not on quality (how well the listing expresses the host's unique offer). A host who fills every field with generic answers has 100% completion but zero differentiation. Meanwhile, 'Pause matters more than delete' signals that hosts abandon the differentiation challenge when it overwhelms -- they need to be able to retreat to solitude and return, not lose their work.",
      "solution": "Redesign the listing wizard to scaffold differentiation as a progressive self-expression exercise rather than a form-filling task. Specifically: (1) Reframe the wizard steps as expression challenges, not data fields. Step 1 (Space Snapshot) stays factual, but Step 5 (House Rules) should be prompted by questions that draw out the host's personality: 'What does a good morning look like in your home?' rather than 'Select house rules from the following list.' Step 6 (Photos) should guide the host to capture what makes the space theirs, not just document room dimensions. (2) Provide differentiation feedback alongside completion feedback. After each step, show how the listing compares to others in the area -- not competitively, but as calibration: 'Most hosts in Williamsburg mention kitchen access. You have not yet -- want to add it?' This helps the host understand what information guests use to differentiate between listings. (3) Implement the pause function as a solitude-recovery mechanism. The host can close the wizard at any step, and all work is preserved. On return, a 'where you left off' summary shows what was completed and what remains -- making re-entry effortless. Csikszentmihalyi: 'the ultimate test for the ability to control the quality of experience is what a person does in solitude' (lines 281-282). A host who pauses the wizard is retreating to solitude to process the self-expression challenge; the platform must welcome them back without penalty. (4) Default pricing values serve as Csikszentmihalyi's 'laws' that liberate: 'to be completely free one must become a slave to a set of laws' (lines 637-638). The pricing default frees the host from the paralyzing calculation of what their privacy is worth by providing a market-derived constraint they can accept or adjust.",

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "Csikszentmihalyi identifies three conditions for flow in relationships: 'common goals, reciprocal feedback, matched challenges and skills' (synthesized from lines 656-702, 968-972). Active lease is where these conditions must be actively maintained between host and guest, but the platform provides only the infrastructure (Stays Manager, messaging, cleaning photos) without ensuring the flow conditions are met. The journey context identifies the core risk: 'Entropy is the basic condition of group life, just as it is of personal experience. Unless the partners invest psychic energy in the relationship, conflicts are inevitable, simply because each individual has goals that are to a certain extent divergent from those of all other members of the family' (lines 697-700). Host and guest have divergent goals (the host wants quiet mornings; the guest wants to cook breakfast). Without active goal alignment and reciprocal feedback, these divergences amplify into conflicts. The user stories do not address active lease directly -- they focus on pre-commitment phases -- but the cross-activation principle applies: 'Every review is a past guest activating a future one.' Per-stay reviews during active lease are the reciprocal feedback mechanism that keeps the cohabitation relationship in the flow channel. Csikszentmihalyi warns against the 'basic delusion that home life takes care of itself naturally' (lines 855-856). A host who assumes the lease will manage itself -- that rules set at listing creation will be followed without reinforcement -- is subject to this delusion.",
      "solution": "Build a cohabitation flow engine that actively maintains the three conditions for relational flow throughout the lease. (1) Common goals: at the start of each stay cycle, the Stays Manager should surface a shared-goal reminder that connects the host's expectations to the guest's upcoming visit. This is not a rule reminder -- it is a goal statement: 'A clean, respectful stay benefits both of you.' The House Manual serves as the shared goal document, but it must be living -- the host should be able to update it based on feedback from previous stays, and the guest should be notified of changes. (2) Reciprocal feedback: per-stay reviews should be bidirectional. The guest sends cleaning photos and a brief experience note; the host acknowledges and rates the stay. This creates the 'open channels of communication' that Csikszentmihalyi identifies as essential for preventing entropy (lines 693-695). If either party stops providing feedback, the platform should gently prompt: 'Your guest completed their stay -- how did it go?' (3) Challenge-skill balance: the cohabitation challenge should escalate appropriately. Early stays are simple (follow the rules, respect the space). Mid-lease stays should introduce complexity: the date change tool allows schedule adjustments that require negotiation skill. Late-lease stays should surface the renewal question, which is the highest-complexity cohabitation challenge. This progression matches Csikszentmihalyi's insight: 'The only way to restore flow to the relationship is by finding new challenges in it' (lines 734-735). A lease that presents identical challenges from week 1 to week 13 will produce the 'boring routine' that Csikszentmihalyi warns 'might be kept alive by mutual convenience, but is unlikely to provide further enjoyment' (lines 731-733).",

      "problem": "Csikszentmihalyi identifies the autotelic personality as someone who 'rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favorable external environment to enjoy the moment' (lines 295-297). Most hosts begin with purely extrinsic motivation -- income from an unused room. The platform currently treats hosting as a transaction: list, receive proposals, accept, collect payments. This transactional framing cannot sustain retention because extrinsic motivation is fragile -- it collapses when better alternatives appear or when the social cost exceeds the financial reward. Csikszentmihalyi warns explicitly: 'extrinsic reasons are not the only ones for staying married... There are great opportunities for joy and for growth that can only be experienced in family life, and these intrinsic rewards are no less present now' (lines 593-596). For hosts, the parallel is exact: a host who continues solely for income will eventually find the social cost (disrupted solitude, cleaning management, rule enforcement) exceeds the financial reward. The user stories do not directly address retention, but the pause mechanism signals the need: 'Pause preserves the work, keeps the door open, and costs nothing.' A host who pauses is retreating to solitude to recover. The question is whether they return -- and that depends on whether they discovered intrinsic rewards during their hosting experience.",
      "solution": "Build an autotelic development arc into the host journey that progressively surfaces intrinsic rewards alongside the extrinsic income. (1) During active lease, surface non-financial hosting milestones: 'Your guest left a 5-star review,' 'You have hosted 3 guests successfully,' 'Your response time is in the top 20% of hosts in your area.' These milestones acknowledge the host's growing social skill -- the competence at managing cohabitation that Csikszentmihalyi would recognize as skill development in a flow activity. (2) At lease end, frame the retrospective not just as a financial summary but as a growth narrative: 'Over 13 weeks, you managed 13 stay cycles, resolved 2 date changes, and maintained a 4.8 average rating. Your hosting skills have grown.' This narrative helps the host recognize their intrinsic development -- they are not just richer, they are more skilled at managing social complexity. (3) For retention, offer escalating challenges that match the host's developed skill. A first-time host who completed one successful lease should be invited to optimize their listing (higher differentiation), try flexible pricing, or mentor a new host. These are the 'new challenges' that Csikszentmihalyi says are necessary to prevent boredom (lines 734-735). A host who re-lists with the same listing for the same type of guest will find 'the obvious challenges have been exhausted' (line 729). (4) The pause function serves as what Csikszentmihalyi calls 'taming solitude' -- a host who pauses is exercising their ability to enjoy solitude after a period of social intensity.

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "Proposal management is where the host evaluates whether a specific stranger will create flow or entropy in their household. Csikszentmihalyi warns: 'The same person can make the morning wonderful and the evening miserable. Because we depend so much on the affection and approval of others, we are extremely vulnerable to how we are treated by them' (lines 120-124). Every proposal is a concrete person asking to enter the host's life. The host is not just reviewing dates and prices -- they are performing a social assessment: will this person respect my space, follow my rules, contribute to household flow or generate psychic entropy? The user stories confirm that proposal quality determines host activation: 'A well-structured proposal -- clear dates, schedule, pricing, intent -- activates the host to respond. A vague or incomplete one creates friction.' The flow lens explains why: a structured proposal demonstrates the guest's capacity for ordered consciousness. A vague proposal signals psychic disorder -- the guest cannot articulate their needs, which the host instinctively reads as a threat to their ordered environment. But the platform provides the host with insufficient social assessment tools. Guest profiles may be incomplete. Reviews may be absent. The proposal may contain dates and prices but no information about the guest's lifestyle, schedule, or compatibility with the host's cohabitation style. The host must make a high-stakes social decision with low-quality social information.",
      "solution": "Redesign proposal presentation to surface the social assessment information the host needs to evaluate whether this specific guest will contribute to household flow. (1) Proposal quality indicator: show the host a visual signal of how well-structured the proposal is (percentage of fields completed, presence of a personal message, whether dates align with the listing's availability). This is Csikszentmihalyi's 'feedback' condition applied to the host's evaluation task: before engaging with the proposal details, the host can assess whether the guest invested sufficient psychic energy in composing it. (2) Guest social profile: alongside the proposal terms, surface the guest's platform history -- previous stays, reviews given and received, verification status, response time in prior communications. This is the 'flexibility of relationships' (lines 135-136) data that helps the host assess whether this particular social arrangement is within the flow channel or in the anxiety zone. (3) Counter-proposal as creative flexibility: the counter-proposal mechanism should be framed not as rejection but as Csikszentmihalyi's 'redefining the rules of the social situation' (lines 160-162). The host who changes duration from 16 to 10 weeks is exercising social creativity -- defining the parameters within which cohabitation flow can occur. The platform should make countering feel empowering, not adversarial. (4) Urgency surfacing: pending proposals should appear first on the host dashboard with clear time-sensitivity signals, matching the user stories principle that 'urgency should surface first.'",

      "journey_phases": ["retention"],
      "problem": "Csikszentmihalyi's final section on the wider community reveals a retention pathway invisible through other lenses: 'A person is part of a family or a friendship to the extent he invests psychic energy in goals shared with other people. In the same way, one can belong to larger interpersonal systems... the larger the social arena one moves in, the greater the challenges it presents' (lines 1050-1060). A host who only hosts is operating at the 'family' level of social complexity -- managing one household relationship at a time. This level of challenge eventually exhausts itself: 'the obvious challenges have been exhausted' (line 729). The host has learned to manage cohabitation, but there are no new challenges at the individual hosting level. Without escalation, Csikszentmihalyi predicts 'boredom and frustration will inevitably set in' (lines 654-655). The user stories identify cross-activation at the individual level ('When someone who has already used Split Lease applies to a host who has never had a guest, that guest's reputation does the selling'). But cross-activation currently operates passively through reviews and profiles. There is no active community infrastructure where experienced hosts invest psychic energy in shared goals with other hosts or with the platform itself. This means the platform's highest-skill hosts -- those who have mastered individual hosting and are ready for greater challenges -- have nowhere to grow. They either repeat the same hosting experience (boredom) or leave (under-challenge).",
      "solution": "Create a host community layer that provides escalating social challenges beyond individual hosting. (1) Host mentoring: pair experienced hosts (2+ successful leases) with new hosts in their area. The mentor receives a new challenge -- guiding someone else through the hosting journey -- that requires higher social skill than individual hosting. The mentee receives the benefit of local, experienced guidance. This is Csikszentmihalyi's wider community in action: 'trying to optimize the goals of unrelated individuals involves complexities an order of magnitude higher' (lines 1062-1063). (2) Neighborhood hosting networks: hosts in the same area can share overflow demand, coordinate on pricing, and collectively improve the hosting experience in their neighborhood. This creates the 'common goals' that Csikszentmihalyi identifies as necessary for group flow (line 656): the shared goal of making their neighborhood a desirable hosting destination. (3) Platform contribution: experienced hosts should be invited to contribute to listing standards, house rule templates, and pricing guidance -- investing psychic energy in the platform's evolution. This is the highest level of social complexity: 'the larger the social arena one moves in, the greater the challenges it presents.' (4) Each community role should be voluntary and intrinsically rewarding. The mentor who helps a new host succeed experiences flow through the social challenge, not through a badge or discount.",
