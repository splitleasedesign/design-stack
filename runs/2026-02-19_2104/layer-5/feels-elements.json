      "journey_phases": ["listing_creation"],
      "problem": "Listing creation asks the host to perform the most intimate act in their journey: articulate what makes their home unique and then invite a stranger into it. Csikszentmihalyi describes Dorothy who 'personalized her surroundings to an uncommon degree' with 'flower tubs, garden gnomes, discarded tools' and notes that 'as extensions of Dorothy's taste, this junk creates a familiar environment where her mind can be at ease. In the midst of untamed nature, she has introduced her own idiosyncratic style, her own civilization' (lines 386-394). Every host has similarly introduced their civilization into their space. But the listing wizard treats this personal expression as a data-collection exercise: select room type, check amenities, upload photos. The emotional experience is bureaucratic, not creative. The host is documenting their home for a database, not painting a self-portrait for a potential cohabitant. The user stories confirm the emotional gap: 'Completion percentage is a good host nudge' -- but a nudge toward completion is not a nudge toward expression. A host who fills every field with minimum-effort generic answers achieves completion without achieving differentiation. They have done the paperwork without doing the self-expression. The emotional cost is that the listing fails to attract guests who would actually enjoy the host's 'civilization,' and the host never experiences the flow of articulating their identity.",
      "solution": "Transform the wizard's emotional tone from data collection to guided self-expression. Each step should feel like a conversation about the host's home, not a form about a property. Step 1 (Space Snapshot) can remain factual, but the transition to Step 5 (House Rules) should feel like a deepening: 'Now, the personal stuff -- what makes living here, living here?' Prompt questions should be concrete and answerable: 'What is your kitchen like at 8am?' rather than 'Describe your space.' Photo guidance should help the host see their space through a guest's eyes: 'Show us the view from the bedroom window -- that is what a guest will wake up to.' The emotional arc of the wizard should be: factual (space details) to personal (how you live here) to invitational (come see for yourself). Copy should avoid the word 'listing' in favor of 'your space' or 'your home.' The completion percentage provides progress feedback; the differentiation prompts provide quality feedback; but the emotional tone of the prompts, questions, and copy provides the creative energy that makes the wizard a flow activity rather than a chore.",

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The host's deepest emotional need during active lease is not information but predictability. Csikszentmihalyi opens the chapter by establishing that 'whether we are in the company of other people or not makes a great difference to the quality of experience' (lines 30-31). The host has voluntarily disrupted their solitude, but the disruption is tolerable only if it is predictable. Unpredictable social intrusion generates what Csikszentmihalyi calls the 'nearly intolerable sense of emptiness' in reverse -- not emptiness from being alone, but the chaos of not knowing when you will be alone versus when a stranger will be in your kitchen. The user stories' urgency-first principle addresses action items, but the emotional need underneath urgency is control: 'I know what my week looks like, I know when I have space to myself, I know when to expect company.' Csikszentmihalyi describes Dorothy's strict routines as the mechanism that 'keeps control in an alien environment' (line 401). The host's active-lease environment is alien -- it has been transformed by the guest's recurring presence. The rhythm strip is the host's routine-equivalent: visual proof that the pattern is known, controlled, and manageable.",
      "solution": "The rhythm strip's emotional function is to be the first thing the host sees on every Stays Manager visit -- a reliable, predictable visual anchor that immediately communicates 'Your week is ordered. You are in control.' The emotional design should prioritize calm and clarity over information density. Guest-present days should feel warm (the accent green creates a living, natural association -- like plants growing, not like warning lights flashing). Guest-absent days should feel spacious (the open, light surface-warm cells communicate breathing room, personal space). Today's highlighted day should feel grounded (the accent bottom border says 'you are here, right now'). The emotional rhythm the strip creates is: solitude, companionship, solitude, companionship -- not as a burden but as a pattern the host has chosen and can see. When a date change proposal appears as a pulsing outline on affected days, the emotional message is: 'Something might shift -- but you can see exactly what, and you decide.' The rhythm strip should feel like the host's personal calendar for the most important recurring event in their week: the oscillation between having their space to themselves and sharing it.",

Csikszentmihalyi describes the vulnerability of social assessment: 'Because we depend so much on the affection and approval of others, we are extremely vulnerable to how we are treated by them' (lines 122-124). The host is about to invite someone into their home -- a decision that will affect their daily quality of life for weeks. But the proposal interface treats this as a transaction: here are the terms, accept or reject. The social dimension -- the human being behind the proposal -- is visually subordinate to the financial terms. The emotional experience is one of processing paperwork, not evaluating a potential cohabitant. This mismatch between the emotional weight of the decision (inviting a stranger into my life) and the emotional weight of the interface (reviewing a form) creates a disconnect that either trivializes the decision (leading to poor guest selection) or amplifies anxiety (the host feels the weight but the interface provides no emotional support).",
      "solution": "Reframe proposal evaluation emotionally as selective hospitality: the host is choosing whom to welcome into their home, not processing an application. The guest's photo and name should be the first visual element the host encounters -- before the terms, before the dates, before the price. The emotional sequence should be: 'Who is this person?' (photo, name, verification) then 'What do others say about them?' (reviews from previous hosts) then 'What are they proposing?' (terms). This inverts the typical transactional hierarchy (terms first, person second) in favor of a hospitality hierarchy (person first, terms second). Copy on the proposal card should use hospitality language: 'Jessica would like to stay in your home' not 'New proposal received.' The accept button should read 'Welcome Jessica' not 'Accept proposal.' The counter-proposal option should read 'Suggest adjustments' not 'Counter-offer.' The decline button should read 'Not this time' not 'Decline.' Each word choice reinforces the emotional frame: this is a personal invitation decision, not a business transaction.",

He warns against social arrangements that 'mimic friendship relations, but provide few of the benefits of the real thing' (lines 909-910). A hosting arrangement where host and guest merely coexist -- the guest follows rules, the host collects payments, neither engages beyond the minimum -- is the household equivalent of 'drinking buddies.' It prevents entropy but does not produce growth. The emotional risk of active lease is not conflict (which the platform's tools can address) but indifference -- the host going through the motions of hosting without investing the psychic energy that would make it enjoyable. Csikszentmihalyi: 'entropy is the basic condition of group life. Unless the partners invest psychic energy in the relationship, conflicts are inevitable' (lines 697-698). But even before conflicts arise, the absence of investment produces a flatness that makes the host resent the disruption to their solitude without gaining any social reward.",

The host should feel that each week of hosting is building something -- not just collecting rent, but developing a well-functioning cohabitation arrangement.

The one-sentence note option ('The kitchen was spotless -- Jessica mentioned she found the herb garden delightful') gives the host a channel for noticing positive details, which Csikszentmihalyi identifies as the basis for enjoyment: paying attention to what is happening, not just enduring it. The stay-cycle progress visualization (completed segments filling with accent green) creates a visual narrative of growing experience. The host sees their hosting competence accumulating: '7 of 13 stays completed -- more than halfway, and your average rating is 4.8.' This is not gamification; it is visible evidence of invested psychic energy producing results.

      "journey_phases": ["retention"],
      "problem": "The lease ends, the guest departs, and the host returns to full solitude. This is a complex emotional moment. Csikszentmihalyi describes it precisely: 'the ultimate test for the ability to control the quality of experience is what a person does in solitude, with no external demands to give structure to attention' (lines 281-282). The host who has spent 13 weeks with structured social demands (arrivals, departures, reviews, date changes) suddenly has no external structure. The Stays Manager goes quiet. The rhythm strip shows 7 empty days. The emotional risk is the 'nearly intolerable sense of emptiness' (line 179) that Csikszentmihalyi identifies -- not because the host is lonely, but because the purposeful structure of hosting has been removed. If the platform treats lease end as an expiration -- 'Lease ended. Your listing is inactive.' -- the host's emotional experience is one of loss. If it treats lease end as a harvest -- 'Here is what you grew over 13 weeks' -- the experience shifts to accomplishment. The user stories' pause mechanism ('Pause preserves the work, keeps the door open') is the retention safety net, but the emotional design of the lease-end moment determines whether the host pauses with pride or pauses with exhaustion.",
      "solution": "Design the lease-end moment as a harvest celebration followed by a gentle transition to chosen solitude. The growth narrative from L2 (communicates-005) provides the content; the emotional design provides the feeling. When the lease ends, the Stays Manager transitions from its active-lease state to a lease-end summary view. The transition should feel like arriving at a lookout point after a long hike: a moment to pause, look back at the journey, and appreciate the distance covered. The stay-cycle timeline (all 13 segments filled in accent green) appears prominently -- a complete visual record of sustained engagement. Guest feedback quotes in Instrument Serif italic create a warm, personal tone. Milestone icons in accent provide visual markers of achievement. The financial summary is present but compact -- the number is acknowledged, not celebrated. Below the summary, the forward-looking challenge cards create a bridge to the future: 'What comes next?' The emotional transition from 'active host' to 'resting host' is supported by copy that honors both states: 'You hosted Jessica for 13 weeks and earned a 4.8 rating. Your space is yours again. When you are ready, your listing is here.' The 'Pause' and 'Re-list' buttons appear side by side, equally weighted -- neither is the 'right' choice. The host chooses their next chapter: solitude (pause) or renewed social engagement (re-list).",
