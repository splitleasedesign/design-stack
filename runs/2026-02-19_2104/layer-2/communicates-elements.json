      "title": "Solitude-Companionship Rhythm Strip: Temporal Information Architecture for the Host's Week",
      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The host's primary information need during active lease is not what happened (past stays) or what is owed (payments) but what is coming: when is the guest here, when am I alone, when does my week shift between shared space and private space? Csikszentmihalyi establishes that 'keeping order in the mind from within is very difficult. We need external goals, external stimulation, external feedback to keep attention directed' (lines 199-201). The host's Stays Manager currently provides administrative information (dates, payments, messages) but not the temporal rhythm information that structures their lived experience. Without a scannable weekly rhythm, the host's attention wanders into speculation: 'Is the guest arriving tonight? Will I have the kitchen to myself tomorrow morning?' This is the psychic entropy Csikszentmihalyi warns about -- 'worries are always hovering at the periphery of attention' (lines 210-212). The user stories confirm that 'urgency should surface first on the dashboard,' but urgency (what needs action now) is only half the temporal picture. Rhythm (what my week looks like) is the other half -- and it is the half that directly shapes the host's daily quality of life.",
      "solution": "Design a weekly rhythm strip as the Stays Manager's primary visual information element. The strip displays 7 days in a horizontal row, with each day showing one of three states: guest-present (filled, indicating shared space), guest-absent (open, indicating solitude), and transition (half-filled, indicating arrival or departure day). Below each day, a single line of contextual text: 'Guest arrives 3pm' or 'Space is yours.' Above the strip, the current day is highlighted with a subtle marker. The rhythm strip is always visible at the top of the Stays Manager without scrolling. It answers the host's primary question -- 'What does my week look like?' -- in under 3 seconds. When a date change request is pending, the affected days pulse gently to signal that the rhythm may shift, and tapping them shows the proposed change alongside the current schedule. The strip evolves across the lease: early weeks show the first few stay cycles as the host learns the rhythm; mid-lease shows the established pattern with variation markers; late-lease shows the winding-down period with lease-end clearly visible.",

Csikszentmihalyi describes differentiation as 'each person is encouraged to develop his or her unique traits' (lines 668-669), and Dorothy's personalization of her surroundings (lines 386-394) illustrates what genuine self-expression looks like. But a host filling out the wizard has no information about whether their listing will stand out or blend in. They do not know what guests look for, what other hosts in their area emphasize, or whether their house rules are standard or distinctive. The completion percentage is a flow-feedback mechanism (lines from user stories: 'a visible progress indicator creates just enough friction to get them to finish'), but it measures effort, not quality. A host who completes 100% of fields with generic answers receives the same completion signal as a host who writes distinctive, personality-rich descriptions. The information architecture fails to guide differentiation because it provides quantity feedback without quality calibration.",
      "solution": "Add a differentiation calibration layer to the listing wizard that shows the host how their choices compare to the local market -- not competitively, but informationally. After each wizard step, surface 1-2 brief calibration signals. Step 1 (Space Snapshot): 'Most listings in your area include kitchen access -- you have not mentioned it. Want to add it?' Step 5 (House Rules): 'You selected 3 standard rules. Hosts in Williamsburg who add personalized rules (like quiet hours or shared-space schedules) receive 15% more proposals.' Step 6 (Photos): 'Listings with 5+ photos showing both rooms and common spaces get 25% more engagement.' These calibration signals are informational, not evaluative. They help the host understand the information landscape guests use to differentiate between listings. The signals appear as collapsible hints below each step's completion confirmation -- visible for hosts who want guidance, dismissible for those who do not. Pricing calibration follows the same pattern: the default price is shown alongside the local range ('$850/night -- similar listings range from $750-$1,050'), giving the host the context to evaluate whether the default serves their goals.",

      "problem": "Csikszentmihalyi identifies 'clear feedback' and 'open channels of communication' as essential for maintaining flow in family relationships: 'If a husband does not know what bothers his wife, and vice versa, neither has the opportunity to reduce the inevitable tensions that will arise' (lines 694-696). Per-stay reviews are the mechanism for this reciprocal feedback in the host-guest relationship, but the information architecture around them is missing. The host does not know whether the guest found the space clean, whether the house rules were clear, or whether the stay met expectations -- unless a formal review is submitted. And reviews typically happen at lease end, when the feedback is retrospective rather than actionable. Csikszentmihalyi's family flow requires ongoing feedback, not post-mortem assessment: 'without concentration, a complex activity breaks down into chaos' (line 870). A 13-week lease with feedback only at week 13 means 12 weeks of unmonitored cohabitation where small irritations can compound into relationship-breaking conflicts. The user stories' cross-activation principle applies: 'Every review is a past guest activating a future one.' But per-stay micro-reviews also serve as mid-lease communication -- each one tells the host how the current relationship is going, not just how it went.",
      "solution": "Design a per-stay micro-review information architecture that makes reciprocal feedback lightweight, regular, and actionable. After each stay cycle (guest departs and sends cleaning photos), both host and guest receive a brief feedback prompt. The host's prompt: 'How was this stay?' with a 5-point scale and an optional one-sentence note. The guest's prompt: the same. Both responses are shared with the other party after both have submitted (preventing influence bias). The information architecture surfaces this feedback in three locations: (1) The rhythm strip: completed stay-cycle segments on the rhythm strip show a small indicator if a review was submitted (green dot) or is pending (amber dot). The host can tap a completed segment to see the guest's review for that stay. (2) The Stays Manager body: a 'recent feedback' section shows the last 2-3 micro-reviews from the guest, so the host can track the relationship's trajectory. An upward trend in ratings signals flow; a downward trend signals entropy that needs attention. (3) The lease-end summary: all per-stay micro-reviews aggregate into a narrative timeline that shows how the cohabitation experience evolved. This is both retrospective feedback for the host and prospective trust data for future guests.",

The proposal contains terms (dates, price, duration) but the host's actual question is social: 'Will this person respect my space? Will they follow my rules? Will cohabitation with them be flow or entropy?' The user stories identify that 'a well-structured proposal activates the host to respond' while 'a vague one creates friction.' But even a well-structured proposal with no guest context leaves the host guessing about the person behind the dates. The host in this phase is performing what Csikszentmihalyi calls social assessment -- the same evaluation any family makes when a new person enters the household: 'genetic programming may predispose us to attachment to family members, the cultural context will have a great deal to do with the strength and direction of that attachment' (lines 521-525).

This dual-column layout ensures the host can assess terms and person simultaneously, without navigating between screens. A proposal quality indicator (compact visual -- a completeness bar or rating) appears at the top of the proposal card, allowing the host to triage multiple proposals before diving into any one. For counter-proposals, the terms column becomes editable: changed elements are highlighted with the impact shown inline ('Changing from 16 to 10 weeks saves you 6 weeks of hosting but reduces total income by $5,100').

Did hosting make me more capable, more connected, more skilled at managing social complexity -- or just more tired? The platform currently provides only financial summaries at lease end (total income, payments processed). This frames hosting as a transaction, reinforcing extrinsic motivation.
