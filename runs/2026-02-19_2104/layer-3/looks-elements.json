      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The host's primary active-lease anxiety is temporal uncertainty about when their space is shared versus private. L1 (works-001) defines the rhythm management process; L2 (communicates-001) specifies the information architecture. The visual design challenge is creating a scannable, emotionally resonant representation of the host's weekly rhythm that communicates at a glance: 'When is my space mine, and when is it shared?' Csikszentmihalyi describes Dorothy structuring her time with strict routines (lines 396-398) and emphasizes that 'more important than structuring space, perhaps, is structuring time.' The rhythm strip must visually structure the host's time, transforming abstract schedule data into a felt pattern. It must be warm enough to feel like a personal calendar, not a corporate Gantt chart, while remaining precise enough to answer specific questions ('Is the guest arriving today?').",
      "solution": "Design the rhythm strip as a 7-day horizontal bar with three visual states per day. Guest-present days use a filled cell in accent (#2d5a3d at 15% opacity background with a solid accent left-border, 3px). Guest-absent days use an open cell with surface-warm (#fdfcfa) background and a subtle dashed left-border in ink-ghost (#bdb8b0). Transition days (arrival or departure) use a half-filled gradient -- accent-light (#e8f0eb) fading to surface-warm -- with a small Feather arrow-right icon (16px, ink-soft) for arrivals or arrow-left for departures. Today's cell is distinguished by a 2px bottom border in accent (#2d5a3d) and slightly elevated shadow (shadows.sm). Each cell contains a day abbreviation in Outfit at 12px/font-weight-medium in ink-soft, and below it a single contextual line in Outfit at 11px in ink-muted: 'Guest arrives 3pm' or 'Space is yours' or nothing for standard present/absent days. Pending date changes are indicated by a subtle pulsing outline on affected days -- signal-warn (#c17a28) at 40% opacity, 2s cycle, respecting prefers-reduced-motion. The entire strip sits in a surface (#ffffff) card with radius.md (10px) corners, shadows.sm, and spacing.md (16px) internal padding. It occupies full width at the top of the Stays Manager, below the urgency action band.",

      "problem": "L1 (works-002) requires differentiation scaffolding in the listing wizard; L2 (communicates-002) specifies calibration signals as collapsible hints. The visual challenge is introducing guidance without making the wizard feel cluttered or evaluative. Csikszentmihalyi describes how Dorothy 'personalized her surroundings' with 'flower tubs, garden gnomes, discarded tools' (lines 386-388) -- the wizard must encourage this kind of personal expression, not suppress it under form-field rigidity. The completion percentage already provides quantitative feedback; the differentiation prompts provide qualitative calibration. Visually, these must occupy a distinct but subordinate layer: present for hosts who want guidance, invisible to those who do not. The user stories note: 'Completion percentage is a good host nudge... creates just enough friction to get them to finish -- without being in the way.' The differentiation prompts must achieve the same balance: helpful without being in the way.",

The card is collapsed by default -- showing only the first line of the hint with a 'Learn more' affordance in accent. Expanding reveals the full calibration data point (e.g., 'Listings with personalized rules receive 15% more proposals'). Each card has a dismiss affordance (small X in ink-ghost) that collapses it permanently for that step. The completion percentage lives as a persistent horizontal bar at the top of the wizard -- a thin (4px) accent-colored fill against a bg-deep (#eae7e1) track, with a percentage label in Outfit 12px font-weight-semibold in ink-soft. For pricing, the market range appears inline next to the price field: a compact span in Outfit 13px ink-muted showing '$750-$1,050 in your area' -- no card, no icon, just contextual text that grounds the default value.",

Surface-warm background keeps the card warm and inviting. The scale-pulse animation on selection is the card's 'one signature animation' -- restraint over spectacle. The overall feel matches the style guide's 'trust and sophistication' principle: the review process is dignified and appreciated, not gamified or pressured."

      "problem": "L1 (works-004) requires an autotelic development arc; L2 (communicates-005) specifies a growth narrative as the primary lease-end information. The visual challenge is creating a summary that feels like a meaningful reflection on a lived experience -- not a data dashboard, not a report card, but a narrative that helps the host see their own growth. Csikszentmihalyi describes the autotelic personality as someone who has 'passed the test for having achieved a creative life' (lines 295-297). The visual design must help the host feel this achievement -- not through celebratory graphics but through the quality and presentation of their hosting story. The financial summary is secondary; the growth narrative is primary. This inversion of typical platform summaries (income first, everything else second) requires a visual design that makes the growth section feel substantial and the financial section feel compact.",
      "solution": "Design the lease-end summary as a single-column page with three visually distinct sections. Section 1 (Growth Narrative, primary): opens with a full-width surface (#ffffff) card with radius.lg (16px) and shadows.md. A timeline visualization runs horizontally across the top: 13 small circles (each representing a stay cycle) connected by a line, with completed cycles in accent (#2d5a3d) and the current position marked by a larger circle. Below the timeline, milestone cards appear in a vertical stack: each milestone is a compact row with a Feather icon (check-circle, star, message-circle, etc., 20px, accent) and descriptive text in Outfit at 15px ink-soft. Examples: 'First successful lease completed,' 'Maintained 4.8 average across 13 stays,' 'Managed 2 date changes smoothly.' Below milestones, guest feedback highlights appear as styled quotes: the guest's words in Instrument Serif at 16px italic ink-soft, with attribution in Outfit at 12px ink-muted. Section 2 (Financial Summary, secondary): a compact card in surface-warm (#fdfcfa) with radius.md. A single row shows total income, per-night average, and platform fee in Outfit at 14px ink-soft, with the total income highlighted in Outfit at 18px font-weight-bold ink. Expandable detail available via a 'See breakdown' link in accent. Section 3 (Forward-Looking Challenges, action): 2-3 cards in a horizontal row (mobile: vertical stack), each with accent-light (#e8f0eb) background, radius.md, and a challenge title in Outfit at 15px font-weight-semibold ink plus a one-line description in Outfit at 13px ink-soft. Examples: 'Optimize your listing,' 'Try flexible pricing,' 'Mentor a new host.' Each card has a subtle arrow-right affordance in ink-muted.",

      "brand_alignment": "The use of Instrument Serif for guest quotes creates a moment of visual warmth and distinction -- the guest's voice is literally rendered in a different typeface, signaling its importance. This follows the design philosophy of 'trust and sophistication' -- guest feedback is treated as valuable testimony, not as data points. The accent-light challenge cards at the bottom create an open, inviting visual field -- they do not demand action but make continued engagement feel natural. The overall page design avoids the 'congratulations' aesthetic (no confetti, no badges) in favor of thoughtful reflection -- matching Csikszentmihalyi's tone of quiet, purposeful self-assessment."
