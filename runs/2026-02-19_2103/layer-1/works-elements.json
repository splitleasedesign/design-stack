      "journey_phases": ["move_in", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "The guest journey during active_lease is not a single linear experience but a recursive loop: each stay within the lease has its own arrival, navigation, communication, cleaning, and departure. Campbell describes the Road of Trials as 'Dragons have now to be slain and surprising barriers passed -- again, again, and again. Meanwhile there will be a multitude of preliminary victories, unretainable ecstasies, and momentary glimpses of the wonderful land' (lines 428-431). Each stay is a dragon. But the platform currently treats each stay as a flat operational event -- arrive, stay, leave -- without acknowledging that every return is a threshold crossing, every host interaction is a goddess encounter, and every successful departure is a trial survived. The user stories document identifies that each stay has its own cycle (arrival notification, active stay, cleaning photos, review), yet the platform does not build the emotional and informational scaffolding that helps the guest experience each stay as cumulative progress rather than repetitive obligation. Without this scaffolding, the tenth stay feels identical to the first, which violates Campbell's insight that the Road of Trials produces 'preliminary victories' -- the guest should feel that each successful stay adds to their initiation, not merely to their calendar.",
      "solution": "Design the stay cycle as a mini-hero-journey with visible progression. (1) Each arrival notification should reference the guest's cumulative history: 'Stay 7 of 12 -- you have successfully completed 6 stays in this space.' This transforms arrival from an operational event into a milestone on the Road of Trials. (2) Post-stay reviews should accumulate into a visible trial record: the guest sees their own arc of reviews, improving comfort, deepening familiarity. (3) The cleaning photo submission should be framed not as a chore but as the ritual proof of honorable trial completion -- Campbell's hero emerging and presenting evidence of victory. (4) The Date Change Tool (add, remove, swap) should be positioned as the guest's primary amulet for navigating the trial landscape, framed as 'adjusting your schedule' rather than 'requesting permission.' (5) Each successful stay should produce a micro-reward signal -- a brief visual confirmation that this trial has been passed, this dragon slain.",

      "problem": "Move-in is the Belly of the Whale -- the guest physically enters a stranger's home and confronts the gap between the listing's representation and the space's reality. Campbell describes the hero who 'instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold, is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died' (journey-context, citing lines 155-156). The guest at move-in is being swallowed: they leave their known environment and enter a 'landscape of symbolical figures (any one of which may swallow him).' The Inanna descent (lines 349-396) maps to the guest's progressive confrontation with reality: the neighborhood is not quite as pictured, the building entrance differs, the room is smaller or larger than expected. By the time the guest stands in the space, 'all the garments of ladyship' of their prior expectations have been removed. The user stories document's emphasis on 'Reality vs. listing expectations' gains its full weight here. The platform currently provides the House Manual, but this sacred text of the new world is often accessed only at the moment of crisis rather than before arrival. The guest is Inanna standing naked before the throne, and the House Manual is the instruction that should have been given at the first gate.",
      "solution": "Design move-in as a structured descent through seven preparatory gates, each stripping one layer of uncertainty. (1) Gate 1 (48 hours before): Send neighborhood orientation -- transit, nearby landmarks, what to expect on the street. This removes the 'crown of the plain' of idealized location. (2) Gate 2 (24 hours before): Send building access details -- entry codes, key pickup, parking. This removes the 'rod of lapis lazuli' of logistics uncertainty. (3) Gate 3 (12 hours before): Send the House Manual with highlight summary -- the three most important rules. This removes the 'small lapis lazuli stones' of behavioral uncertainty. (4) Gate 4 (at arrival): Prompt the guest to confirm arrival via the app. This is the threshold moment -- the guest crosses from outside to inside. (5) Gate 5 (first hour): Surface the full House Manual with a 'settling in' frame -- Wi-Fi, thermostat, trash schedule. (6) Gate 6 (first evening): Prompt a brief check-in message to the host -- 'Everything OK?' This is the first post-threshold communication, the hero's first words in the new world. (7) Gate 7 (morning after): A brief prompt: 'How was your first night?' with one-tap response options. This confirms the guest survived the Belly and is ready for the Road of Trials. Each gate is a stripping of uncertainty, and the guest arrives at the seventh gate knowing the space -- not as a listing, but as a lived reality.",

Campbell describes the goddess as 'the incarnation of the promise of perfection; the soul's assurance that, at the conclusion of its exile in a world of organized inadequacies, the bliss that once was known will be known again' (lines 482-484). The host IS this figure: they hold what the guest seeks. But the tale of Niall and the hag at the well (lines 694-731) reveals the danger: Fergus, who sees only the ugly surface of the counter-offer ('sooner than give thee a kiss I would perish of thirst!'), gets no water. Only Niall, who embraces the terms as they are, finds the hag transformed into 'Royal Rule.' The platform currently presents counter-offers as term modifications -- duration changed from 16 to 10 weeks, new total price calculated. But this presentation strips the negotiation of its relational meaning. The guest sees numbers changing, not a person responding. The counter-offer IS the goddess revealing her true terms, and the guest must see through the surface (a shorter duration, a different price) to the underlying partnership being offered.",
      "solution": "Redesign negotiation to surface the relational dimension alongside the transactional one. (1) When a host counter-offers, present the counter alongside a brief explanation space where the host can share their reasoning. The platform prompts the host: 'Would you like to add a note about your counter-offer?' This converts the cold term change into a dialogue -- Campbell's ritual exchange between hero and goddess. (2) Surface the counter-offer's impact clearly but warmly: 'The host suggests 10 weeks instead of 16. Here is what that means for your nightly rate, total cost, and schedule.' Transparency is the antidote to Fergus's ugliness -- the guest who can see the full picture can embrace the terms. (3) Frame the guest's response options as relational, not transactional: 'Accept these terms,' 'Suggest a different arrangement,' 'Ask the host about this.' The third option (messaging) is critical -- it is the hero's chance to dialogue with the goddess rather than accepting or rejecting in silence.

In negotiation, the host is a counterparty (counter-offers, terms). In move_in, the host is a physical or communicative presence (key handoff, welcome message). In active_lease, the host is a recurring relational figure. But the platform does not design for this transfiguration -- the host's representation remains static across phases. The listing photo and name that appeared in search appear identically in the proposal view, the negotiation view, and the active lease dashboard. The guest's relationship with the host deepens across phases, but the host's platform representation does not deepen correspondingly.

The transformation reflection mechanism is the antidote: it helps the guest discover their own position in the larger pattern -- not just a tenant, but a participant in a shared-living community who has developed real skills and earned real trust."
