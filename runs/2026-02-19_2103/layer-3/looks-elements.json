      "problem": "Campbell's Road of Trials is defined by recursion -- 'again, again, and again' (line 429) -- but the visual treatment of active_lease stays currently presents them as a flat, undifferentiated list. Each stay card looks identical: same styling, same weight, same visual presence. This produces what Campbell warns against: the hero loses sight of the wonderful land because each trial blurs into the next. The guest cannot see their own progression. The user stories document identifies that the guest's accumulated history -- 'reviews, familiarity with how things work' -- is a valuable asset, but the visual system does not render this asset as a visible arc. The result is visual monotony that maps to emotional monotony: the guest's 10th stay looks exactly like their 1st, which contradicts the reality that the guest is more confident, more competent, and more established by stay 10.",
      "solution": "Design a horizontal timeline component where each stay is a node, and the visual treatment of each node reflects its status. (1) Completed stays: filled circles in accent (#2d5a3d), connected by a solid line in accent-light (#e8f0eb). Each filled circle is a dragon slain. (2) Current stay: a larger, pulsing circle in accent-bright (#3a7a52) with a subtle shadow-md glow. This is the dragon currently being faced. (3) Future stays: outlined circles in border (#e2dfd9), connected by a dashed line. These are the dragons yet to come. (4) Milestone stays (stay 3, stay 6, final stay): slightly larger nodes with an inner marker, accompanied by a brief label ('First month,' 'Halfway,' 'Final stay'). These are Campbell's 'momentary glimpses of the wonderful land.' (5) The overall visual arc should move left-to-right, with completed stays gently receding (smaller opacity) and the current stay in full visual focus. The timeline lives at the top of the stay dashboard, providing instant orientation before any detail is consumed.",

Campbell describes how the goddess can appear 'terrible and benign' simultaneously (line 627) -- and the counter-offer IS this dual revelation. Changed terms are the 'terrible' face (the guest's desired arrangement is altered). The host's willingness to engage is the 'benign' face (the host cared enough to counter rather than decline). The visual treatment determines which face the guest sees first. A ledger-style presentation (old terms crossed out, new terms in bold) foregrounds the terrible. A person-centric presentation (host photo, message, engagement signals) foregrounds the benign. Campbell's insight that the goddess is 'redeemed by the eyes of understanding' (line 673) demands that the visual system give the guest 'eyes of understanding' -- a visual frame that presents the host as a person before the terms as numbers.",

Each changed term has a one-line contextual note in ink-soft (#4a4640) at 12px. Connecting line between old and new uses border (#e2dfd9), not a strikethrough (which reads as rejection). (3) Bottom zone: three equal-weight response buttons. 'Accept' in accent (#2d5a3d) filled. 'Suggest different terms' in outline. 'Message [Host Name]' in outline with a message icon.

Currently, platform notifications use a single visual template regardless of context: the same card style for a marketing message, a date change alert, and a move-in orientation message. This visual uniformity means the guest cannot distinguish the sacred rites of the descent from ordinary platform communication. Campbell's gatekeeper declares 'Extraordinarily have the decrees of the nether world been perfected. Do not question the rites' (lines 354-356) -- the visual system must convey this gravity without creating anxiety.",

The cleaning photos are the guest's proof that they have treated the host's space with respect -- the equivalent of Campbell's hero presenting the trophy.

(3) Move-in: contextualized avatar -- 56px circle, same accent-light ring, accompanied by a 'Your Host' label in ink-muted (#8a857e) at 12px sans. Below: communication channel indicator (message icon). The host is a guide. (4) Active lease: relational avatar -- 48px circle (returns to standard size for dashboard integration) with a stay-interaction indicator: a small dot showing recent communication status (accent for 'active in last 24h,' ink-ghost for 'no recent activity'). The host is a relationship. The progressive system ensures the host's visual presence grows with the guest's knowledge, never remaining frozen.",

          "quote": "As he progresses in the slow initiation which is life, the form of the goddess undergoes for him a series of transfigurations... By deficient eyes she is reduced to inferior states; by the evil eye of ignorance she is spellbound to banality and ugliness. But she is redeemed by the eyes of understanding.",
          "insight": "The avatar system IS the 'eyes' through which the guest sees the host. A static avatar system is 'deficient eyes' that spell-bind the host to banality. The progressive system provides 'eyes of understanding' -- each phase reveals more of the host as a person, redeeming them from the flatness of a listing-page thumbnail."

          "insight": "The avatar enhancement at negotiation phase (engagement ring, response time badge) is a credibility signal made visual. The guest sees not just the host's face but their engagement behavior, and this visual evidence contributes to the trust-building that the user stories identify as critical."

          "insight": "The active-lease communication status dot addresses the four aspects: an accent dot shows the benign, present host. An ink-ghost dot shows the absent host. The visual system does not judge -- it reflects reality, allowing the guest to see the host clearly rather than projecting."

The transfiguration is felt as 'I keep seeing the same person, but I understand them better each time.'",
      "brand_alignment": "The progressive avatar system reflects the design system's principle of 'trustworthy, not corporate' -- it uses subtle, human-centric enhancements (ring borders, communication dots) rather than badges or labels that feel institutional.
