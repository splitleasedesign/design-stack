The critical target phases are move_in (Crossing the First Threshold / Belly of the Whale), active_lease (Road of Trials as recurring stay cycles, Meeting with the Goddess as encounters with the host-as-guardian), and the implicit retention arc (Apotheosis / Ultimate Boon as the transformation that makes the guest want to continue). Negotiation maps to the Meeting with the Goddess because the host controls access to the boon (the space). The Initiation lens uniquely illuminates what happens AFTER acceptance: the guest's life inside the shared space is a succession of trials (each stay a new test), meetings with the host-as-goddess (each communication a potential revelation or rebuke), temptations to flee or settle for less, and — if the initiation succeeds — a transformation that makes the guest no longer a stranger but a resident, no longer anxious but at home."

      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Discovery is the Call to Adventure. The guest hears about Split Lease and something stirs — a dissatisfaction with their current housing situation that Campbell would recognize as the 'blunder that reveals an unsuspected world.' The guest is still in the Ordinary World: Craigslist, Facebook groups, Airbnb, word-of-mouth roommate searches. These are the 'familiar life horizons' that have become insufficient. Campbell writes that the hero 'moves in a dream landscape of curiously fluid, ambiguous forms' once they cross the threshold — but in discovery, the guest has not yet crossed. They are hearing the call. The user stories document confirms this with 'Value before the ask — always': the guest in discovery needs to see a glimpse of the extraordinary world (the platform's listings, the promise of matched housing) before they will answer the call. Campbell's Initiation chapter is clear that the hero is 'covertly aided by the advice, amulets, and secret agents of the supernatural helper whom he met before his entrance into this region' — in discovery, these helpers are referrals, social proof, and the platform's first impression. The guest has not yet begun the initiation; they are being summoned to it.",

The user stories document reveals that 'listing cards want more layers' — richer hover states, image counters, availability indicators, neighborhood labels — because the guest is navigating a labyrinth and needs wayfinding tools. Campbell describes the hero's helpers: 'the advice, amulets, and secret agents of the supernatural helper.' In search, these are the map ('The map should feel alive' — user stories), the filters, the AI matching. The user stories insight that 'the AI should consider budget, schedule, and location holistically so that results feel genuinely matched — not just filtered' maps to Campbell's concept of the supernatural helper who aids the hero through the landscape.

The guest must confront their own assumptions — about what they need, what they can afford, what they are willing to share. The user stories document reveals that 'verified reviews and host credibility signals activate guests' — this is Campbell's 'benign power' manifesting: past guests who have survived their own trials serve as the supernatural helpers who reassure the current hero.

The journey map shows this involves a 'duration selector dropdown' and 'day-of-the-week selection' — each a parameter the guest must actively set, each a decision point where the hero shapes the terms of their own trial. Campbell's description of the hero being 'flung at spikes of white shell' by the Sun-father (lines 1191-1195) maps here: the proposal is the hero throwing themselves at the guardian, and the proposal terms are the 'life-feathers' they clutch tightly. The user stories document confirms that 'the proposal itself is a cross-activation event' — a well-structured proposal activates the host to respond, while a vague one creates friction. This is Campbell's insight about readiness: the hero who is properly prepared (with clear terms, pre-populated details) survives the trial; the one who is not (vague, incomplete) fails.

The host IS this figure for the guest: the host controls access to the space (the boon), and the negotiation is the test of whether the guest is worthy to receive it. The journey map shows the host may counter the proposal — changing duration from 16 weeks to 10 weeks — and the guest must decide whether to accept, counter back, or walk away. This is the 'mystical marriage' test: Campbell writes that the goddess 'can never be greater than himself, though she can always promise more than he is yet capable of comprehending. She lures, she guides, she bids him burst his fetters' (lines 666-668). The host's counter-offer is this luring and guiding: it reshapes the guest's expectations and tests whether they can adapt. The tale of Niall and the ugly hag at the well (lines 706-731) is directly applicable: the brothers who refuse to kiss the hag (refuse the host's counter-terms) get no water; only Niall, who embraces the terms as they are, finds the hag transformed into Royal Rule.

Campbell's Atonement with the Father is about 'the abandonment of that self-generated double monster — the dragon thought to be God (superego) and the dragon thought to be Sin (repressed id)' (lines 1136-1138). For the guest, acceptance means abandoning two dragons: the dragon of impossible expectations (the fantasy of a perfect space at a perfect price) and the dragon of fear (the terror of commitment to a stranger's home). The journey map shows acceptance involves clicking 'Accept Host Terms' and confirming with 'Yes, Proceed' — this confirmation dialog is the ritual moment of atonement. Campbell writes that 'atonement (at-one-ment) consists in no more than the abandonment of that self-generated double monster' (lines 1135-1136). The guest and host become 'at-one': their terms are unified, their commitment mutual. The platform then sends lease documents — the formal seal of the atonement. Campbell's insight about the father-as-initiator is crucial here: 'the invested one has been divested of his mere humanity and is representative of an impersonal cosmic force.

      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Active lease is the CORE of the Initiation — the Road of Trials proper. Campbell writes: 'Dragons have now to be slain and surprising barriers passed — again, again, and again. Meanwhile there will be a multitude of preliminary victories, unretainable ecstasies, and momentary glimpses of the wonderful land' (lines 428-431). Each stay cycle within the active lease IS a trial: the guest arrives, navigates the space, communicates with the host, cleans, sends photos, departs, and reviews. Then it repeats. Campbell's 'again, again, and again' maps precisely to the recurring stay structure that the journey map describes. The host-as-goddess is now fully present: not as a listing photo or counter-offer, but as a living person whose communication patterns, expectations, and temperament define the quality of each trial. Campbell's concept of the goddess having both 'good' and 'bad' aspects — 'the nourishing, the comforting, the good mother' and 'the absent, unattainable mother, the hampering, forbidding, punishing mother' (lines 485-499) — maps to the host who is sometimes responsive, warm, and accommodating (the benign goddess) and sometimes absent, demanding, or inflexible (the terrible goddess). The Date Change Tool (add, remove, swap dates) is the hero's magical instrument for negotiating with the forces of the trial-world. Campbell describes how the hero is 'covertly aided by the advice, amulets, and secret agents of the supernatural helper' (lines 22-24): the platform's tools — the Leases page, the payment tracker, the messaging system — are these amulets. The cleaning photos the guest sends after each stay are the ritual proof that the trial has been honorably completed — Campbell's hero emerging from each trial and presenting evidence of victory. The stay review is the hero's reflection on the trial: 'the clue to what we must do to be saved' (line 175). Woman as the Temptress also manifests here: the temptation is not sexual but existential — the temptation to see the arrangement as 'merely transactional' rather than transformative, to treat the shared space as a hotel room rather than a home, to disengage emotionally and count the days. Campbell warns that 'every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid, in the end, to a restriction of consciousness' (lines 813-814).

For the guest, this is the moment when shared living stops feeling like a compromise and starts feeling like a discovered way of being. The guest who reaches Apotheosis does not merely tolerate the arrangement — they are TRANSFORMED by it. They understand shared space differently. They know how to live with a stranger. They have been 'twice-born' (line 1354) as a person who can navigate the social complexity of co-habitation. The Ultimate Boon, Campbell says, is 'the indestructible essence of existence' (line 2641).
