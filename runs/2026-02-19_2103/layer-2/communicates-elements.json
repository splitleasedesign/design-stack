      "problem": "Move-in is the Belly of the Whale -- the guest crosses the threshold from digital evaluation into physical habitation. Campbell's Inanna is stripped at seven gates, each removing a layer of adornment before she stands 'naked before the throne' (lines 393-396). For the guest, move-in strips away each layer of listing-page expectation and replaces it with physical reality. The information architecture challenge: what to disclose when, so that each layer of uncertainty is addressed at the right moment in the guest's descent. Currently, the House Manual is delivered as a single document after acceptance -- a monolithic information dump that corresponds to Inanna being stripped of all garments at once rather than gate by gate. The guest either reads everything (cognitive overload) or reads nothing (arrives unprepared). Neither outcome supports the structured initiation that Campbell's model prescribes.",
      "solution": "Decompose move-in information into seven sequential disclosures, each timed to the guest's psychological readiness and physical proximity to the space. Gate 1 (post-acceptance, 48h before): neighborhood overview -- transit, walkability, local landmarks. Gate 2 (24h before): access logistics -- building entry, key/lockbox, parking. Gate 3 (12h before): top 3 house rules distilled from the full manual. Gate 4 (arrival): prompt arrival confirmation. Gate 5 (first hour): full House Manual surfaced with a 'settling in' navigation frame. Gate 6 (first evening): host check-in facilitation. Gate 7 (next morning): first-night debrief. Each gate provides information that strips one layer of the guest's uncertainty, converting the raw unknown of a stranger's home into a structured, comprehensible environment.",

Without a progression-aware information hierarchy, each stay is a disconnected trial with no sense of where the guest stands on the road.

      "journey_phases": ["negotiation"],
      "problem": "When a host counter-offers, the guest sees changed numbers: duration reduced, price adjusted, dates shifted. Campbell's tale of the five brothers at the well reveals what happens when the hero sees only the surface: Fergus encounters the hag and says 'sooner than give thee a kiss I would perish of thirst!' (line 700). He sees the ugly surface (unfavorable terms) and rejects the offer. Only Niall, who sees past the surface to the person, discovers 'Royal Rule.' The information architecture of the counter-offer screen determines whether the guest is Fergus or Niall. Currently, counter-offers foreground the transactional delta (what changed) and background the relational context (who changed it and why). This creates a Fergus architecture: the guest's first impression is 'my terms were rejected' rather than 'the host is proposing a different partnership.' Campbell warns that the goddess is 'reduced to inferior states' by 'deficient eyes' (line 671) -- the counter-offer architecture is the lens through which the guest sees the host, and if the lens is transactional, the host is reduced to a number.",

Show the host's name, photo, and any note they attached to the counter. If no note, show the host's response time and engagement pattern ('This host responded within 4 hours -- they are actively engaged'). (2) Second scan zone: a side-by-side comparison of original terms and proposed terms, with the delta highlighted in neutral (not red/negative) visual treatment. Each changed term should include a brief contextual note: 'Duration: 16 weeks --> 10 weeks. This affects your nightly rate: $X --> $Y.' (3) Third scan zone: response options that include messaging as a primary path, not a secondary one. 'Accept,' 'Suggest different terms,' 'Message [Host Name] about this.'

The platform's tools during active_lease -- the Date Change Tool, the messaging system, the cleaning photo submission, the Stays Manager -- are these amulets. But the platform currently presents them as operational requirements rather than aids. 'Submit your cleaning photos' reads as compliance. 'Request a date change' reads as permission-seeking. The information architecture frames the guest as a subject of the platform's rules rather than a hero equipped with the platform's tools. This framing produces what Campbell identifies in the Woman as Temptress section: 'every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid, in the end, to a restriction of consciousness' (lines 813-814). The guest who sees the tools as constraints restricts their consciousness to mere compliance; the guest who sees them as amulets expands their consciousness to active navigation.",

(2) Cleaning photos: rename from 'Submit Cleaning Photos' to 'Show Your Space Is Ready.' The frame shifts from compliance to ritual completion -- the hero presenting evidence of their trial's honorable conclusion. (3) Arrival notification: rename from 'Notify Host of Arrival' to 'Mark Your Arrival.' The guest is the one marking the threshold crossing, not reporting to the host. (4) Stay review: frame as 'Reflect on This Stay' rather than 'Rate This Stay.' The review becomes the hero's own reflection on the trial, not a score assigned to the host.

Reviews are shown to hosts; stay counts are stored in databases; trust scores are calculated behind the scenes. The guest who has completed 20 stays across two leases has undergone genuine transformation, but the platform reflects none of this back to them.

Hosts describe you as [composite adjective from reviews].'

This block is the hero's trophy presented at the next threshold.
