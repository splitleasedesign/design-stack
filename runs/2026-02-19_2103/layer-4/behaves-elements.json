      "journey_phases": ["acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "The seven-gate move-in orientation (L1, works-002) requires a time-sequenced delivery mechanism that respects the guest's psychological readiness at each stage. Campbell's Inanna does not choose her pace through the gates -- the gatekeeper governs each transition. But the platform must govern this pacing without making the guest feel controlled. Currently, platform notifications arrive based on system events (acceptance confirmed, lease activated), not based on the guest's proximity to move-in. A guest who accepts a proposal 3 weeks before move-in receives the same notification cadence as one who accepts 2 days before. This temporal insensitivity means the seven gates either arrive too early (the guest forgets them by move-in) or too compressed (the guest is overwhelmed with 7 messages in 48 hours). Campbell's gatekeeper delivers each gate's instruction at precisely the threshold moment -- the platform must do the same.",
      "solution": "Implement a countdown-anchored notification sequence triggered by the move-in date, not the acceptance date. (1) Gate 1 fires at T-48h: neighborhood orientation push notification + in-app card. (2) Gate 2 fires at T-24h: access logistics. (3) Gate 3 fires at T-12h: top 3 house rules. (4) Gate 4 fires at T-0 (move-in morning): arrival confirmation prompt. (5) Gate 5 fires 1 hour after arrival confirmation: full House Manual surfaced. (6) Gate 6 fires at 6pm on move-in day: host check-in prompt. (7) Gate 7 fires at 9am the morning after: first-night debrief prompt. Each gate is delivered as a gate notification card (L3, looks-003) with contextual timing. If the guest does not open a gate notification, it persists as an unread card on their dashboard but does not block subsequent gates -- the descent continues regardless, as Inanna's passage through each gate was not contingent on her understanding why the garment was removed.",

          "insight": "The gatekeeper's refrain is non-negotiable: the rite proceeds regardless of the guest's questioning. This maps to the notification sequence being time-anchored rather than engagement-contingent. If the guest does not open Gate 2, Gate 3 still arrives at T-12h. The descent is structured; the guest may engage at their own pace but the structure does not wait."

The interaction pattern is: surface information at the moment it matters, not before."

The platform's current interaction for counter-offers is typically binary: accept or decline, with messaging as a secondary afterthought. This interaction pattern produces Fergus scenarios: the guest sees changed terms, cannot easily explore why, and defaults to rejection. The user stories document identifies that 'messaging before proposals is a natural step' and that messaging 'reduces abandonment when someone is not ready for a proposal.' The same principle applies to counter-offers: messaging before acceptance or rejection reduces abandonment when someone is not ready to decide.",

(1) Accept path: single tap on 'Accept These Terms.' Optimistic UI transition (per reference behaves-001 pattern from prior runs) -- immediate visual confirmation. The guest has embraced the hag. (2) Counter path: tap 'Suggest Different Terms' to open an inline term editor pre-populated with the host's counter-offer. The guest adjusts specific fields (duration, dates) and submits. This is a new offering at the well -- 'I will not just kiss you, I will offer a different embrace.' (3) Message path: tap 'Message [Host Name]' to open inline messaging within the counter-offer context. The message thread shows the counter-offer summary above the compose field, so the host sees what the guest is responding to. This path is critical: it is the mechanism by which the guest can ask 'Why 10 weeks instead of 16?' and discover the partnership behind the terms. All three paths are visually co-equal (same button size, same prominence) and all three dismiss the counter-offer card once initiated (accept commits, counter navigates to editor, message navigates to thread).",

Completion triggers the warm background shift and checkmark. (3) Reflection beat: 24 hours after departure (or after evidence submission, whichever is later), the review prompt surfaces. Frame: 'Reflect on This Stay.' The review is not a rating form but a brief reflection -- overall feeling (one-tap emoji scale), one optional sentence, and a private note option for platform-only feedback.

Campbell describes the hero's amulets as aids that 'the hero is covertly aided by' (line 22) -- instruments of agency, not instruments of compliance.

This framing contradicts the amulet metaphor -- a hero does not 'request permission to use their sword.' The user stories document's emphasis on 'authentication should be invisible until it matters' extends to all platform mediation: the approval process should be invisible in the interaction's framing, even if it exists in the backend. Campbell's Woman as Temptress section warns that 'every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid to a restriction of consciousness' (lines 813-814).

Changes appear immediately on the calendar in a 'pending' visual state (accent-light background instead of full accent). (3) Confirmation: when the guest is satisfied with their adjustments, they tap 'Confirm Changes.' A brief summary shows what changed: 'Adding Tuesday Feb 24, Removing Thursday Feb 26.'

But transcendence requires a mirror -- the hero must see their own transformation to complete it. The guest who has completed 8 of 12 stays has undergone genuine growth: they know the space intimately, they have a working relationship with the host, they navigate the stay cycle with ease. But nothing in the platform reflects this growth back to them. Without the mirror, the Apotheosis cannot occur -- the guest completes the lease feeling 'done' rather than 'transformed.' The user stories document identifies that cross-activation depends on the guest's history being visible to future hosts, but the prerequisite is that the guest's history is visible to the guest themselves -- you cannot share a transformation you have not recognized.",
      "solution": "Design two reflection surfaces that appear at mid-lease and at lease end. (1) Mid-lease reflection (fires at the midpoint stay): a dashboard card that summarizes the journey so far. Content: 'You are halfway through your lease with [Host Name]. You have completed [X] stays, exchanged [Y] reviews, and spent [Z] nights in this space.' Tone: warm, narrative, not statistical. Visual: timeline (L3, looks-001) with the midpoint marker highlighted. One optional interaction: 'Share what is working' (a brief freeform input that goes to the host as a positive mid-lease check-in). (2) End-of-lease reflection (fires after the final stay's review is submitted): a fuller summary card. Content: 'Your journey with [Host Name] is complete. [X] stays, [Y] nights, [Z] mutual reviews. Here is what your hosts have said about you: [composite quote from reviews].' Below: 'Your experience is now part of your Split Lease profile. Future hosts will see your [X] completed stays.' This is the Apotheosis moment: the guest sees themselves as initiated. One optional interaction: 'Continue with [Host Name]' (re-lease inquiry) or 'Explore new spaces' (search, carrying their credential forward).",
