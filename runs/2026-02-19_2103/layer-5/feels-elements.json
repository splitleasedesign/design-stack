      "problem": "Move-in is the most emotionally intense moment of the guest journey. The guest stands at the threshold of a stranger's home and experiences what Campbell describes as 'I stood before a dark cave, wanting to go in, and I shuddered at the thought that I might not be able to find my way back' (lines 176-178). The listing photos promised one reality; the physical space delivers another. Inanna was stripped naked before the throne of Ereshkigal and 'they fastened their eyes upon Inanna -- the eyes of death' (lines 395-396). The guest's first moments in the space are this stripping: every assumption is tested, every expectation confronted. The dominant emotion is acute vulnerability -- the guest has committed financially, traveled physically, and is now alone in an unfamiliar environment. The platform currently does almost nothing to mediate this moment. The House Manual is a static document; the host may or may not be present; the space speaks for itself. The guest's emotional experience is determined almost entirely by chance.",
      "solution": "The platform must convert the Belly of the Whale from an unmediated crisis into a guided descent where vulnerability is expected and supported. The target emotion is not comfort (that would be dishonest -- move-in IS uncomfortable) but prepared vulnerability: the guest feels the discomfort but knows they are not alone and that the discomfort is part of the process. The seven-gate orientation (L1, works-002) is the mechanism; the emotional design is the tone. Each gate should communicate: 'What you are about to feel is normal. Here is what will help.' The first-evening check-in prompt (Gate 6) should explicitly normalize the emotional experience: 'First evenings in a new space can feel strange. That is completely normal. Here is how to reach [Host Name] if you need anything.' The morning-after debrief (Gate 7) should acknowledge the threshold crossing: 'You made it through your first night. How are you feeling?' The emotional arc of move-in is: anxiety (pre-arrival) --> orientation (gates 1-3) --> threshold (arrival) --> stabilization (gates 5-7) --> readiness (morning after).",

      "problem": "When a host counter-offers, the guest's default emotional response is defensive: 'My proposal was not good enough.' Campbell's Fergus embodies this: confronted with the hag's demand for a kiss, he sees only ugliness and refuses. 'Sooner than give thee a kiss I would perish of thirst!' (line 700). The guest who sees a counter-offer as a rejection of their proposal perishes of thirst -- they walk away from an arrangement that could have worked. The user stories document identifies that 'pricing details surfaced at every decision point' is critical, but the emotional dimension goes deeper than pricing transparency. The guest needs to feel curiosity about the host's reasoning, not defensiveness about their own proposal's inadequacy. Campbell writes that 'the hero who can take her as she is, without undue commotion but with the kindness and assurance she requires, is potentially the king of her created world' (lines 674-677). The guest who can take the counter-offer 'as it is' -- with curiosity rather than offense -- discovers the partnership behind the numbers.",
      "solution": "The platform must shift the guest's emotional frame from 'my proposal was rejected' to 'the host is inviting me into a different arrangement.' The target emotion is relational curiosity: the guest wonders what the host is thinking, not whether their own proposal was flawed. (1) The counter-offer notification should use the host's name as the subject: '[Host Name] has a suggestion for your arrangement' (not 'Your proposal has been modified'). (2) The host's note (if provided) should be the first thing the guest reads -- the person before the numbers. (3) If the host did not provide a note, the platform should suggest a bridge: 'Want to ask [Host Name] about their suggestion?' This shifts the emotional trajectory from reaction to dialogue.

But if the platform treats every stay identically -- same notifications, same prompts, same emotional tone -- it prevents the guest from feeling their own growth. Campbell's Woman as Temptress warns of the opposite danger: 'every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid to a restriction of consciousness' (lines 813-814).

The Bodhisattva who 'permeated the whole texture of existence with the divine grace of his assisting presence' (lines 1811-1812) is the ultimate expression of this transcendence: the hero who has been initiated does not merely benefit from the initiation but radiates its benefits outward. For the guest, the Apotheosis is the moment shared living stops feeling like accommodation and starts feeling like identity -- they are not a person who rents a room, they are a person who knows how to live flexibly, share space respectfully, and navigate the relational complexity of co-habitation. But the platform does not cultivate this identity. The guest's emotional relationship with Split Lease remains transactional: they use the platform to find housing, not to develop a skill or claim an identity.

(1) The end-of-lease reflection should use language that names the transformation: 'You navigated 12 stays across 4 months in a shared space. That takes real skill.' (2) The guest's accumulated reviews should be synthesized into a character reflection: 'Hosts describe you as reliable, respectful, and easy to communicate with.' This is not flattery -- it is the Bodhisattva seeing their own compassion reflected back. (3) The forward-looking prompt should frame the guest's future in terms of their new identity: 'Your experience makes you a trusted guest on Split Lease. Wherever you go next, this goes with you.'

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "Campbell's Woman as Temptress is not about sexual temptation but about the temptation to restrict consciousness -- to see life (or the shared-living arrangement) through a narrow, defensive lens rather than an expansive, engaged one. 'Every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid, in the end, to a restriction of consciousness' (lines 813-814). For the guest during active_lease, the temptation manifests as transactional minimalism: treating the space as a hotel room, disengaging from the host, going through the motions of the stay cycle without emotional investment. This restriction is understandable -- emotional engagement with a stranger's space is costly. But it is also the path to dissatisfaction: the guest who restricts consciousness counts the inconveniences and ignores the benefits, ultimately leaving the arrangement feeling exploited rather than enriched. Campbell warns that 'generally we refuse to admit within ourselves the fullness of that pushing, self-protective, malodorous, carnivorous, lecherous fever which is the very nature of the organic cell' (lines 836-838) -- the guest who refuses to admit that shared living IS uncomfortable sometimes, who expects perfection, becomes the Hamlet who cries 'how weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world!' (lines 853-854).",
      "solution": "Design mid-lease touchpoints that gently expand the guest's consciousness beyond transactional minimalism. The target emotion is tempered agency: the feeling that the guest is an active participant in the arrangement, not a passive consumer of it. (1) Per-stay reflections (L4, behaves-003 reflection beat) should occasionally prompt expansive thinking: 'What worked well this stay?' rather than only 'Rate this stay.' The guest is invited to notice the positive, not just evaluate the neutral. (2) Mid-lease communication prompts should encourage the guest to engage with the host beyond logistics: 'Is there anything about the space that [Host Name] could help with?' This is not a complaint form -- it is an invitation to participate in improving the arrangement. (3) Date changes and schedule adjustments should be framed as the guest shaping their experience, not managing their obligations. (4) The cleaning photo ritual should carry a brief reflection prompt: 'This space was your home this week.' Not a question -- a statement that expands the guest's self-concept from 'tenant' to 'temporary resident.'",

          "insight": "The guest's 'ogres' during active_lease are the small frictions of shared living: the host's quirks, the space's imperfections, the schedule's constraints. These ogres are 'reflections of the unsolved enigmas of the guest's own humanity' -- their discomfort with sharing, with compromise, with impermanence. The platform cannot solve these enigmas, but it can help the guest see past them."
