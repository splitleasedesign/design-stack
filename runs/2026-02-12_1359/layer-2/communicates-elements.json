Jessica spent the first 3 minutes interrogating the business model ('Do you work with management companies?', 'I did look up split lease yesterday') because Robert's opening provided no substance—just 'I work for Split Lease.' Without visible authority markers (licenses, known clients, verifiable track record), the host's System 1 defaults to defensive questioning. This consumes cognitive bandwidth that could be spent on economic evaluation. The current discovery touchpoint lacks an authority credential stack that pre-authorizes the conversation.",

Tertiary layer (if host clicks through): Dedicated broker partnership page with testimonials from other brokers, case studies with conversion data, FAQ addressing broker-specific concerns (fee structure, confidentiality, approval processes). On calls, agents open with credential-establishing language: 'I'm Robert with Split Lease. We're a licensed platform that's helped 200+ brokers place inventory this year.'

      "problem": "At 08:42, Jessica states: 'I would need for you to sign something with me, a confidentiality agreement, something, because I have no way of knowing since you're not giving me any of the information of the client.' This demand for legal protection surfaces because Robert hasn't established trust through transparency about how Split Lease protects host relationships. Jessica operates in a high-trust environment where brokers protect their landlord relationships fiercely—if Split Lease bypasses her and contacts her landlords directly, she loses reputation and revenue. Her defensive posture ('I have no way of knowing') signals information asymmetry: she doesn't understand how Split Lease's process protects her interests. Information architecture challenge: How do we proactively address confidentiality concerns before hosts raise them defensively?",
      "solution": "Front-load confidentiality assurance as a PRIMARY information layer during evaluation, before onboarding begins. On broker partnership page, include 'How We Protect Your Relationships' section: (1) 'You control all landlord contact. Split Lease never contacts your clients directly.' (2) 'Your dashboard shows exactly who sees your listings and when.' (3) 'Standard confidentiality agreement available for all partnerships.' Include downloadable template confidentiality agreement so brokers can review terms before the evaluation call. During call, agent references this proactively: 'As you saw on our broker partnership page, we protect your landlord relationships. You control all contact, and we're happy to sign a confidentiality agreement with you.' Dashboard design: Show host a 'Relationship Protection' panel listing all parties who have viewed their listings, with timestamps. Information hierarchy: Confidentiality assurance FIRST (on partnership page, before call), template agreement SECOND (downloadable without signup), relationship visibility THIRD (dashboard panel showing who sees what).",
