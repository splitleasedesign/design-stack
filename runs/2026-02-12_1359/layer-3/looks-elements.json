Professional hosts operate in high-trust environments where visual authority markers (licenses, certifications, recognizable partnerships) trigger automatic credibility assessment. Without these visual signals, hosts default to defensive questioning, consuming cognitive resources that should be spent on economic evaluation. Cialdini explains that authority symbols (titles, uniforms, trappings) create automatic deference. The current discovery touchpoint lacks a visual credential hierarchy that pre-authorizes the conversation. Text-only descriptions ('I work for Split Lease') fail to leverage the visual processing advantages of authority symbols.",

Quantified credibility in sans typography (Outfit 18px medium) with ink-soft (#4a4640): '150+ properties | 200+ broker partners'.
