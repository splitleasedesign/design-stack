      "problem": "Professional hosts (real estate brokers, property managers) operate in high-trust environments where credentials determine partnership viability. When Split Lease reaches out via cold outreach, the host's System 1 immediately runs an authority check: 'Who is this company? What legitimacy signals can I detect?' Without visible authority markers (industry credentials, known brand, verifiable track record), the host's default response is skepticism and defensive questioning. Jessica spent the first 3 minutes of the call interrogating the business model because Robert's opening ('I work for Split Lease') provided no authority substance—only a title without supporting evidence. The current discovery touchpoint (outreach message) lacks authority symbols that would pre-authorize the conversation.",
      "solution": "Embed authority signals into the discovery touchpoint before the evaluation call begins. This means: (1) Outreach messages should include verifiable credentials: 'Split Lease is a licensed real estate platform (License #XYZ)' or 'We work with 150+ properties across Manhattan and Brooklyn.' (2) Include social proof from recognizable authorities: 'Our property partners include [Management Company Name]' or 'Featured in [Real Estate Publication].' (3) Provide a link to a dedicated broker partnership page that displays: testimonials from other brokers, case studies with conversion data, and FAQ addressing broker-specific concerns (fee structure, confidentiality, approval processes). (4) Train agents to open calls with authority-establishing language: 'I'm Robert with Split Lease. We're a licensed platform that's helped 200+ brokers place inventory this year. I saw your listing at [address] and wanted to discuss a partnership model that's working for brokers like [Name].' The pattern is: establish credentials first, then request engagement.",

      "problem": "Professional hosts evaluate Split Lease primarily through an economic lens: 'Will this partnership yield competitive returns vs. my traditional revenue streams?' Jessica spent 6+ minutes (06:29-12:52) negotiating the pricing model because the economics were unclear. Robert's initial answer ('$1,450-$1,500 per month') was immediately challenged by Jessica as unrealistic for Manhattan. The back-and-forth consumed cognitive resources and created uncertainty. When Robert finally explained the markup model ('You give me the price, which is already marked up with your fee. I don't want to know how much you marked up.'), he used autonomy language to build trust, but he also left Jessica without benchmarks. She doesn't know: (1) What markup percentage is typical? (2) How price-sensitive are Split Lease guests? (3) How long does conversion take? Without this data, Jessica is pricing blind, which increases her risk of either under-pricing (losing profit) or over-pricing (losing conversions).",
      "solution": "Provide transparent economic benchmarks during evaluation, before the host commits time to listing creation. This means: (1) The broker partnership page should include a pricing calculator: 'Enter your base rent, see estimated markup range that converts, see projected commission over 3/6/12 months.' (2) Share conversion data: 'Listings priced at $X convert in Y days on average. Listings priced above $Z convert in 2x days.' (3) Compare Split Lease economics to traditional broker fees with concrete examples: 'Traditional broker fee: 1 month rent upfront ($2,000). Split Lease model: $50/day markup over 6 months = $9,000 total commission. You earn 4.5x more, paid over time.' (4) Provide a 'recommended markup' based on property type, location, and lease duration. Allow hosts to override, but give them a starting point grounded in conversion data.

He then advised her to 'start with rooms or studios or one bedrooms. Try to go on the lower cost.' This honesty signal—Robert telling Jessica that her higher-priced inventory won't convert—built credibility and warmed the relationship. Jessica ended the call saying 'That sounds good to me. Thank you so much, Robert.' However, this pattern is agent-dependent (requires Robert's skill and judgment) and doesn't scale. Most hosts won't receive this honest, constraining advice, leaving them to discover through failed conversions that their inventory is mispriced.",

This means: (1) During listing creation, provide real-time feedback: 'Properties in this area at this price typically convert in 30+ days. Reducing price by 15% cuts conversion time to 10 days.' (2) Flag overpriced listings before they go live: 'This listing is priced 20% above comparable properties. Consider adjusting to improve conversion.' (3) After 7 days with no proposals, proactively reach out: 'Your listing hasn't received proposals yet. Based on our data, reducing the daily rate from $X to $Y would increase visibility 3x.' (4) Display 'recommended adjustments' in the host dashboard that show exactly what changes (price, photos, description) would improve conversion likelihood. (5) Use the same 'arguing against our own interests' frame: 'We want you to succeed, and that means sometimes telling you when a listing won't work as currently priced.'

This is a classic scarcity tactic designed to signal that Jessica's inventory is valuable and urgently needed. However, Jessica is a sophisticated operator who recognizes sales tactics. She doesn't blindly accept the scarcity claim; she's testing it conditionally ('I'll send a couple of listings by Friday'). If those test listings don't receive proposals quickly, Jessica will conclude the demand story was oversold, and the partnership will stall.
