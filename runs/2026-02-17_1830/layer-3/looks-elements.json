      "problem": "Susan demands physical inspection three times (2:14, 3:05, 3:42) because the listing's visual signifiers are insufficient to replace in-person verification. Her friend is flying from Oregon — the cost of a wrong decision includes an airline ticket, not just a booking fee. Susan's prior scam experiences ('you know how sometimes people give you all kind of run around,' 2:22) mean her System 1 default for remote housing is 'likely fraud.' Norman states that anti-affordances (the no-preview policy) must be discoverable and perceivable, with substitute signifiers prominently displayed. The listing page's visual hierarchy must place trust verification evidence — verified photos, cancellation guarantee, host identity — at the highest position in the visual hierarchy, above property features, amenities, and price. Currently, no visual pattern exists that structures trust evidence as the primary visual layer rather than supplementary detail.",
      "solution": "Design the listing page's visual hierarchy so that trust verification occupies the top of the visual stack, with three distinct visual signifiers forming an above-the-fold trust triad: (1) A full-bleed verified photo gallery with a purple 'Verified by Split Lease' badge (--primary-purple background, white text, --rounded-pill shape) anchored to the gallery's top-left corner. Photos must cover the exact elements Susan asked about: room, bathroom (1:08), common areas, building entrance. The badge uses --shadow-purple-sm for subtle elevation to distinguish it from photo content. (2) A first-night cancellation guarantee badge displayed with equal visual weight to the nightly price. The badge uses --bg-off-white background with --secondary-purple text and a Feather 'shield' icon at --icon-sm size. It sits immediately beside or below the price, not in a separate section. Norman: 'Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their visibility is critical.' (3) A host identity card with verified photo (--avatar-md, --rounded-full), name in --font-weight-semibold, response time in --text-gray, and guest count. The card uses --shadow-sm elevation on --bg-white with --border-color border. These three signifiers must be perceivable within 6 seconds of page load without scrolling.",

She does not understand the non-continuous nights model ('Like seven nights a week?' at 0:43). Norman warns that 'hand-lettered signs pasted on products are the equivalent of poor design' — when you need to explain what something is, the design itself has failed. The platform's visual identity carries no perceivable signifier that communicates 'part-time housing' to a first-time visitor. The system image is incoherent because no visual element consistently communicates what this service is across pages. Every page the guest encounters — landing, search results, listing detail — must carry a visually consistent identity signifier that functions like a wayfinding marker: it tells the guest 'you are in a part-time housing platform' before they evaluate any specific listing.",

Below it, a one-line subtitle in Inter --font-weight-normal at --text-lg (18px), color --text-gray: 'Part-time rooms and apartments, by the night.' (2) On listing cards in search results, a compact schedule badge appears as the first text element below the photo: a pill-shaped label (--rounded-pill, --bg-off-white background, --text-purple text) reading 'Weeknights' or 'Flexible' or 'Mon-Fri' — the available schedule pattern in 1-2 words. (3) On the listing detail page, the same schedule badge appears as a subtitle directly below the listing title, before the price. The pattern is: the identity signifier uses a consistent visual treatment (purple text on off-white pill) across all pages so the guest recognizes it as a system-level marker, not a listing-specific detail.",

      "problem": "Susan's first three questions in the call are about space composition: 'Is it a full apartment or is it a bedroom?' (0:43), 'What about a bathroom?' (1:08), 'Would somebody else be in the place when she's there?' (1:20). These three questions — space type, bathroom privacy, co-occupancy — constitute the primary decision variables for shared housing. Yet conventional listing card designs lead with photos, price, and location. For a platform where many listings involve shared spaces, the guest's first question is not 'Where is it?' or 'How much?' but 'What am I sharing and with whom?' Norman's signifier principle demands that the answer to this question be perceivable without effort. The visual design must surface space composition as a scannable, standardized label that the guest can evaluate in under 2 seconds per listing card.",
      "solution": "Design a three-part space composition label as the first text element on every listing card, immediately below the photo. The label uses a consistent visual format: three short descriptors separated by a mid-dot (·) character, each using a Feather icon prefix for rapid scanning.

(2) Typography: Inter --font-weight-medium at --text-sm (12px), color --text-dark for the space type and bathroom descriptors, color --text-gray for the co-occupancy descriptor. The co-occupancy element is intentionally softer because it is contextual information, not a hard attribute. (3) Icons: Feather 'home' for space type, Feather 'droplet' for bathroom, Feather 'users' for co-occupancy, all at --icon-xs (16px), color matching their text. (4) On the listing detail page, the same label appears as a horizontal bar below the listing title, with each descriptor expanding on tap/click to show details (e.g., 'Host present evenings' expands to 'Rita works 9-5. She is typically home evenings and weekends. Common areas are shared.'). (5) The label sits above price and location, because for shared housing, space composition is the prerequisite filter before budget evaluation.",

      "problem": "The Susan call contains a real-time negotiation with immediate verbal feedback at every exchange. The platform's negotiation is asynchronous — the guest submits a proposal and waits hours or days. Norman states: 'Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting.' When the phone call drops for 20 seconds at 2:42-3:05, both parties scramble with 'Can you hear me?' — trust erodes instantly from feedback loss. The visual design challenge is: how to make an asynchronous process feel transparent and progressing, rather than silent and abandoned. Every moment in the negotiation must have a visible, informative signifier. The visual pattern must distinguish between different urgency levels — a counter-offer requiring action looks different from a 'still waiting' status — so the guest develops a visual vocabulary for negotiation states.",
      "solution": "Design the negotiation status as a vertical timeline with discrete visual states, each with a distinct color and icon treatment that communicates urgency at a glance. Visual specification: (1) Timeline structure: a vertical line (2px, --border-color) with circular state nodes (--icon-sm size, 20px diameter) at each step. Completed states use a solid purple circle (--secondary-purple fill, Feather 'check' icon in white). The current state uses a larger pulsing circle (24px, --secondary-purple border, --bg-off-white fill) with a subtle pulse animation (scale 1.0 → 1.05, --transition-slow, infinite, ease-in-out). Future states use an empty circle (--border-color border, --bg-white fill). (2) State labels: each node has a one-line label (Inter --font-weight-semibold at --text-base, --text-dark) and a one-line context (Inter --font-weight-normal at --text-sm, --text-gray). Example: 'Host Reviewing' / 'Rita usually responds in 6 hours.' (3) Urgency differentiation: 'Your Turn' states use --accent-coral (proposed) or --protocol-danger as an attention color — the node circle uses coral/red border, the label is bolded, and a subtle left-border accent (3px, --accent-coral) highlights the entire row. 'Still Waiting' states use the neutral pulse. 'Resolved' states (accepted/declined) use --secondary-purple for acceptance or --text-gray for decline. (4) Counter-offer changes are shown as an inline diff: changed terms highlighted with --bg-off-white background and --secondary-purple left border, unchanged terms dimmed to --text-light-gray.",

The House Manual must deliver knowledge-in-the-world at the exact moment the guest needs it, organized by the guest's physical action sequence at arrival, not by topic category. The cancellation guarantee — which Bryant improvised at 3:16 — must be the most visually prominent element during the first 24 hours, because it is the safety net that made the entire booking possible.

When two roles (coordinator and occupant) share one booking, the interface must visually distinguish whose information is displayed and whose actions are available. Norman's signifier principle requires that 'people need some way of understanding what is happening and what the alternative actions are.' If the proxy sees her friend's check-in instructions mixed with her own payment details, the conceptual model breaks — she does not know which information is for her and which is for the friend.

Coordinator accent: --secondary-purple as a 3px border is decorative and does not carry text, so contrast against background is not applicable for text. Occupant accent: --accent-blue as a 3px border follows the same principle. Role badge: --white text on --secondary-purple = approximately 6.3:1 (AA pass). All text within role-colored zones uses --text-dark on their respective backgrounds: --text-dark on --bg-off-white = approximately 15.8:1 (AAA); --text-dark on --bg-info = approximately 15.4:1 (AAA). The subtle background color difference between coordinator (warm purple tint) and occupant (cool blue tint) zones is a supplementary signal, not the sole differentiator — the label prefixes ('Your' vs. 'Guest') and left-border accents carry the primary semantic distinction.",

Once activated, the coordinator section appears first (purple accent, 'Your' prefix) because the coordinator is the active user. The occupant section follows (blue accent, 'Guest' prefix). During the active lease, the role indicator badge at the top of the Stays Manager establishes context immediately ('Managing for [Friend's Name]'), and the role-colored panels below organize information by relevance to the current user's role.",
      "brand_alignment": "The coordinator role uses --secondary-purple, the brand's primary interactive color, because the coordinator is the actively transacting user. The occupant role uses --accent-blue, the style guide's secondary accent, maintaining the purple-centric palette while providing visual distinction. The --bg-off-white and --bg-info zone backgrounds are both already in the style guide's background color system, used here as role-semantic identifiers. The role indicator badge follows the pill badge convention (--rounded-pill) from the style guide. This approach avoids introducing new brand colors by reusing existing secondary colors with new semantic meaning."
