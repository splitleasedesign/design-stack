      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "search", "listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "The platform has no independent system image. Susan's entire interaction with Split Lease is mediated by Bryant — a human being who serves as the sole signifier for the service's identity, operational model, and trustworthiness. Susan misidentifies Split Lease as a real estate brokerage (4:55: 'Real estate Agent'), requiring Bryant to verbally correct her conceptual model. She never encounters the platform's interface, search page, or listing page. Norman's system image principle states that 'the designer of the product and the person using the product form somewhat disconnected vertices of a triangle' and 'the entire burden of communication is on the system image.' Split Lease's system image does not exist independently of Bryant. If Bryant is removed from the interaction, the user has no triangle vertex to form a conceptual model from — the system image collapses entirely.",
      "solution": "Build a system image that can communicate Split Lease's identity, purpose, and operational model without human mediation. This requires: (1) The landing page must signify what Split Lease IS within 5 seconds — not 'a marketplace' (too generic) but 'part-time housing: book the nights you need, not the ones you don't.' The signifier must be perceivable to someone whose existing conceptual model of housing is 'full-time occupancy.' (2) Every page must carry the core signifier: this is not a hotel, not Airbnb, not a real estate brokerage — it is schedule-native shared housing. The system image must be consistent across all touchpoints so the guest can form one coherent conceptual model. (3) The first interaction should not require Bryant. A guest who arrives at the site via a link, a search result, or a referral must be able to understand what actions are possible (Norman's discoverability) without calling anyone. (4) When a human intermediary IS involved, the platform should bridge from the human to the digital: Bryant's name, the listing discussed, and the terms mentioned should appear on the platform so it feels like a continuation of the conversation, not a disconnected system.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "negotiation", "acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "Susan demands to physically inspect the space three times in the call (2:14, 3:05, 3:42). She is told that pre-booking inspection is not allowed for privacy reasons. This creates an anti-affordance — a deliberate prevention of interaction — but the anti-affordance has no discoverable signifier explaining WHY it exists or WHAT substitutes are available. Norman states that anti-affordances must be discoverable and perceivable, or the user will walk into the glass wall. Susan's prior experience with housing scams ('you know how sometimes people give you all kind of run around,' 2:22) means her default conceptual model for remote housing is 'likely fraud.' The listing page's current signifiers — whatever they may be — are insufficient to overcome this default model. Susan explicitly proposes photos as a substitute signifier (3:42), and Bryant improvises a first-night cancellation guarantee (3:16), but neither of these critical affordances is discoverable through the platform itself.",
      "solution": "Build a layered trust signifier system that makes the anti-affordance (no pre-booking inspection) acceptable by making its substitutes prominently discoverable. This requires: (1) Verified photos as primary trust signifiers — not optional, not thumbnail-sized, but prominent, labeled as verified, and comprehensive (room, bathroom, common areas, building entrance). Susan specifically asked about the room and bathroom (1:08); the photos must cover exactly what guests ask about. (2) First-night cancellation guarantee as a prominently displayed signifier on the listing page and the acceptance screen. Bryant invented this on the fly (3:16); it must be a permanent, discoverable platform affordance. (3) Host identity verification signifiers — verified name, photo, response rate, reviews from prior guests. These replace the face-to-face meeting that Susan's friend cannot have because she is in Oregon. (4) An explicit signifier explaining the no-preview policy: 'For the host's privacy, we don't offer pre-booking tours. Instead, here's how we verify every listing...' Norman's principle: when you cannot make the anti-affordance invisible (like good glass), you must provide a signifier that explains it and directs the user to the substitute affordance.",

      "problem": "Susan thinks in calendar months ('one month or two months,' 0:11), weekday names ('Monday to Friday,' implied by 'five nights a week'), and space types ('full apartment or bedroom,' 0:43). The platform thinks in night counts ('30 night minimum,' 1:35), lease styles, and feature taxonomies. Bryant must perform the mapping between these two vocabularies in real time — twice for the non-continuous nights concept (0:19-0:35 and 1:35-2:00) and once for the minimum stay requirement. Norman's mapping principle states that 'natural mapping, taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding.' The platform's input controls must map to the guest's natural way of thinking about their stay, not require the guest to translate their needs into platform-native units. When the mapping is unnatural, the guest cannot operate the controls correctly — or at all.",
      "solution": "Design every input control to accept the guest's natural vocabulary and translate internally. This requires: (1) Duration selection: let guests select 'about 1 month' or 'about 2 months' and show the equivalent night count as secondary information ('approximately 30 nights'). Do not present a number field labeled 'nights.' (2) Schedule selection: provide one-click presets for common patterns — 'Weekdays (Mon-Fri),' 'Weekends (Sat-Sun),' 'Full week' — rather than requiring individual day toggles. Susan's friend needs 'Monday to Friday,' which should be a single tap. (3) Space type: use labels guests naturally use ('Private room with private bath,' 'Shared room,' 'Full apartment') rather than feature taxonomies. Susan asked 'is it a full apartment or is it a bedroom?' — those are the categories. (4) Location: show a map with neighborhood labels and transit proximity, not just a street address. Susan immediately oriented around the Lincoln Tunnel (5:35); the listing should signify proximity to landmarks the guest knows. (5) Every control should provide immediate visual feedback showing the mapping: 'Mon-Fri for 2 months = 40 nights, starting March 3.'

At every exchange, both parties receive immediate verbal feedback — acknowledgment, explanation, counter-proposal. The platform's negotiation flow must replicate this feedback density, but digital interactions are prone to feedback gaps: submitted proposals that show 'pending' for days, counter-offers that arrive with no notification, status changes that are invisible unless the guest happens to check. Norman states that 'feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting.' The call itself demonstrates this: when the phone connection drops at 2:42-3:05, both parties scramble with 'Can you hear me?' — trust erodes within seconds of lost feedback. Every minute a guest waits for a response to a proposal, a date change request, or a negotiation counter is a minute their trust decays.",
      "solution": "Design the negotiation and active lease flows with Norman's feedback hierarchy: immediate acknowledgment, informative status, and prioritized notifications. This requires: (1) Every guest action (submit proposal, request date change, send message, accept terms) must produce immediate visual feedback confirming the action was registered — not a spinner, but a contextual confirmation ('Your proposal has been sent to Rita. She typically responds within 4 hours.'). (2) Status updates must be pushed, not polled. The guest should never have to check whether something happened. Notifications must arrive via the guest's preferred channel (push notification, email, SMS) within minutes. (3) Feedback must be informative, not just confirmatory. 'Your date change was approved' is better than a green checkmark. 'Rita approved your date change. Your next stay is Monday March 10' is better still. (4) When delays are unavoidable (host has not responded), the platform must provide intermediate feedback: 'Rita has not yet responded. Most hosts respond within 6 hours. We will notify you immediately.' This is the digital equivalent of Bryant saying 'I'll keep you updated' (6:57).

She says 'I can give you a deposit on her behalf' (2:34), 'I'm setting up all appointments for her' (3:58-4:31), and 'before she puts her tickets' (2:14). The platform's conceptual model assumes the person searching, evaluating, proposing, and paying is the person who will stay. Norman's conceptual model principle states that 'a conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn't have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful.' The one-guest-one-user model is not useful when proxies are involved. The platform affords booking (you can fill out forms and pay), but it does not signify proxy booking (there is no discoverable way to indicate 'I am booking for someone else').

(2) In the proposal, capture both the proxy's information (Susan: contact person, local presence, deposit payer) and the guest's information (friend: actual occupant, arrival date, Oregon address). (3) During the active lease, afford dual communication: both the proxy and the guest should receive status updates, feedback, and action prompts. Susan is coordinating locally; the friend is occupying remotely. Both need different information at different times. (4) The acceptance flow must clearly signify who is committing to what: the proxy commits the deposit, the guest commits to the stay. These are different actions by different people and must be signified as such. (5) Norman's constraint principle applies: the proxy's affordances should be constrained to coordination actions (pay deposit, communicate with host, manage schedule), while the guest's affordances include occupancy actions (check in, submit cleaning photos, write reviews).",

      "journey_phases": ["move_in", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Susan's entire call is organized around preventing a catastrophic move-in failure. Her friend is flying from Oregon — the cost of a bad experience is not just the booking fee but an airline ticket, lost time, and a stranded person in an unfamiliar city. The listing page's signifiers (photos, description, price) make promises about the space. Move-in is the moment those promises are tested against reality. Norman distinguishes between 'knowledge in the head' (what the guest remembers from the listing) and 'knowledge in the world' (what is available in the environment at the moment of action). At move-in, the guest's knowledge in the head is limited and potentially distorted by the listing's signifiers. The guest needs knowledge in the world: how to enter the building, how to find the room, how to use the Wi-Fi, how to contact the host if something is wrong, and critically — how to exercise the cancellation guarantee if the space does not match the listing. None of this is discoverable from the space itself. The House Manual is the primary vehicle for delivering knowledge in the world, but only if it is accessible, complete, and organized around the guest's move-in sequence.",
      "solution": "Design the move-in experience as a signifier-to-reality bridge that provides knowledge in the world at the exact moment the guest needs it. This requires: (1) A digital House Manual that is accessible from the guest's phone, organized chronologically by move-in sequence: access the building → find the room → check the space → connect to Wi-Fi → review the cancellation terms → contact the host. Not alphabetically. Not by topic. By the guest's actual action sequence. (2) The cancellation guarantee must be the most prominent signifier in the move-in flow, not buried in terms and conditions. Norman: 'Affordances exist even if they are not visible. For designers, their visibility is critical.' The guest must know they can leave on night one if the space does not match. (3) A move-in checklist that asks the guest to verify key claims from the listing: private bathroom? check. Private room? check. Wi-Fi works? check. This serves dual purpose: it gives the guest a structured way to verify (reducing anxiety) and it gives the platform data on listing accuracy. (4) Co-occupancy must be disclosed and discoverable before and during move-in. Susan asked 'Would somebody else be in the place when she's there?' (1:20). If the guest arrives to unexpected co-occupants, every prior signifier is invalidated. (5) A clear, signified feedback channel for move-in problems: a button or contact method that is visible on the first screen of the House Manual, not buried three levels deep.",
