      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "search"],
      "problem": "Susan arrives with zero understanding of Split Lease. She misidentifies it as a real estate brokerage (4:55: 'Real estate Agent'). Her first encounter with the non-continuous nights concept produces confusion ('Like seven nights a week?' at 0:43). Norman warns that 'when the system image is incoherent or inappropriate, then the user cannot easily use the device.' The emotional consequence of an incoherent system image is not just confusion but alienation: the guest feels she is in the wrong place, that this service is not for someone like her. If the landing page fails to communicate what Split Lease is within seconds, the guest's emotional state transitions from open curiosity to dismissive confusion. The emotional challenge is not about explaining the product but about producing the specific feeling of 'oh, I get it' that prevents the guest from bouncing.",
      "solution": "The platform must produce comprehension relief within 5 seconds of first contact. Comprehension relief is the specific positive emotion that occurs when something initially unclear snaps into focus. The landing page headline ('Book the nights you need. Skip the ones you don't.') must trigger this snap. The voice is casual, direct, and assumes the guest is smart enough to understand immediately. It avoids educational tone ('Let us explain how Split Lease works') and instead speaks as though the model is obvious ('Of course you only book the nights you need'). The emotional arc is: arrive uncertain, read one line, feel 'oh, that makes sense.' The schedule badge on listing cards ('Weeknights' or 'Mon-Fri') reinforces this comprehension by making every listing confirm the model the guest just learned. The emotional principle is: clarity is a feeling, not just a state of understanding. The platform must make the guest feel smart for getting it quickly.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "negotiation"],
      "problem": "Susan is not just evaluating a listing. She is gatekeeping for a vulnerable friend who would fly across the country from Oregon. Her emotional state is protective vigilance: she has been scammed before ('you know how sometimes people give you all kind of run around,' 2:22), she is responsible for someone else's safety, and her default assumption about remote housing is 'likely fraud.' She demands physical inspection three times (2:14, 3:05, 3:42). This is not irrational distrust; it is learned protective behavior. The emotional challenge is that the platform must meet this vigilance without dismissing it, patronizing it, or trying to overcome it with cheerful reassurance. Norman's anti-affordance principle applies emotionally: the no-preview policy is an emotional glass wall. The guest hits it and feels blocked, unheard, and more suspicious than before. The platform must acknowledge the guest's protectiveness as legitimate and redirect it toward verification tools that satisfy the same emotional need.",
      "solution": "The listing page must communicate 'We understand why you are cautious, and here is how we address that' without ever using those words. The tone is matter-of-fact and evidence-based, not reassuring or sales-oriented. Trust signifiers (verified photos, cancellation guarantee, host identity card) should feel like evidence being presented, not like promises being made. The emotional arc at listing evaluation is: arrive vigilant, encounter evidence, feel 'they have anticipated my concerns.' The verification badge says 'Verified by Split Lease' — not 'Trust us!' or 'Don't worry!' The cancellation guarantee is stated as a fact ('Cancel within 24 hours if the space does not match') not as a comfort ('We are here for you if anything goes wrong!'). The no-preview policy explanation is transparent and unapologetic: 'For the host's privacy, tours are not available before booking. Here is how we verify every listing instead.' The emotional principle is: vigilant guests are not reassured by warmth. They are reassured by evidence, transparency, and the feeling that someone competent has already thought about their concerns.",

          "insight": "Susan's three-time repetition of the inspection demand is not stubbornness. It is the emotional expression of protective vigilance. Each repetition is a test: 'Are you hearing me? Are you taking my concern seriously?' The platform must pass this test on the first encounter."

She is not a passive consumer waiting for the platform to guide her. She is an active negotiator who needs to feel in control of the process. But the platform's proposal and negotiation flows are likely to be structured as linear forms ('fill this out, submit, wait') that strip the guest of the agency she demonstrated on the phone. Norman's mapping principle is emotionally relevant here: when controls map naturally to the guest's intentions, the guest feels powerful. When controls are arbitrary or constrained, the guest feels trapped. Susan's emotional need during proposal creation is not simplicity but agency: the feeling that she is configuring the stay on her terms, not filling out someone else's form.",

The schedule presets ('Weekdays,' 'Full Week') are presented as choices the guest makes, not options the platform permits.

The negotiation timeline shows the guest her position in the process with the same transparency a legal document provides: here is what you proposed, here is what the host said, here is what you can do. The tone is transactional and respectful, treating the guest as a peer in the negotiation rather than a supplicant awaiting approval. When the host counters, the changed terms are highlighted clearly so the guest can evaluate and respond with full information.

      "problem": "Susan's conditional readiness to commit ('I'll give you the deposit right there') reveals that acceptance is not a moment of celebration for this guest. It is a moment of heightened responsibility. She is committing money and her friend's travel plans. The emotional state is not excitement but a mix of resolve and lingering anxiety: 'I have decided to proceed, but the risk is still real.' The call ends without formal next steps (6:50: 'let me see if I can get my friend'), leaving Susan in an emotional limbo where commitment and uncertainty coexist. Norman's conceptual model principle applies emotionally: at acceptance, the guest needs a complete mental picture of what she has committed to, what happens next, and what she can do if things go wrong. Without this picture, the commitment feels precarious rather than grounded. The move-in phase amplifies this: the friend flies from Oregon, and the gap between listing signifiers and physical reality reaches its maximum.",
      "solution": "The acceptance confirmation and pre-move-in flow must produce grounded confidence: the specific feeling of 'I know exactly what I signed up for, what happens next, and what to do if something goes wrong.' The acceptance screen restates the key terms in plain language (schedule, duration, total cost, cancellation guarantee), not as legalese but as a clear summary. The tone is confirming, not celebrating. A brief 'What happens next' timeline shows the path from acceptance to move-in: 'You will receive check-in details 24 hours before arrival. Your first night is covered by the cancellation guarantee.' The pre-move-in notification (24 hours before) delivers only the access instructions, reducing cognitive load to one action: get into the building. The House Manual is organized as a chronological walkthrough that the guest opens on arrival, not a reference document to study in advance. The emotional principle is: after commitment, the guest does not need congratulations. She needs a roadmap that makes the unknown feel navigable.",

      "problem": "Susan's friend arrives in a new city, at a space she has never seen, having flown from Oregon. The emotional stakes at move-in are the highest in the entire journey. Every prior interaction (listing evaluation, negotiation, acceptance) was digital. Move-in is where digital promises meet physical reality. Norman calls this the signifier-to-reality gap. For this guest, the gap is amplified by distance (Oregon to New Jersey), by proxy (Susan coordinated but the friend is alone), and by vulnerability (medical appointments, no local support network). Susan has said three times that she needs to 'make sure everything is legit.' The friend now stands in the space and must confirm this herself, without Susan present. The emotional challenge is not just anxiety but isolation: the guest is alone, far from home, and the only tool she has is her phone. The platform must make her phone feel like an ally, not just an information source.",
      "solution": "The move-in experience must produce the feeling of 'I am not alone in this. The platform is walking me through it.' The House Manual opens to Step 1 (access the building) with clear, specific instructions. The verification checklist (Step 2) gives the guest a structured, empowering activity: check each listing claim against reality. Confirming an item produces a small positive feedback (checkmark animation, green border) that converts anxiety into verified trust, one item at a time. The cancellation guarantee banner stays visible for 24 hours, communicating 'you have an exit' without the guest having to search for it. The host contact button is always one tap away. The emotional arc at move-in is: arrive anxious, verify item by item, either confirm the space matches (building trust) or flag discrepancies (activating the safety net). Both paths feel supported. The tone throughout is calm, instructional, and companionable, like a friend who has done this before texting you step-by-step directions.",

      "problem": "Susan's friend will stay Monday through Friday, leave for the weekend, and return the following Monday. This creates a weekly cycle of mini-departures and mini-arrivals over 2 months. Each cycle is a micro version of the move-in experience: arrive, settle, use the space, leave. Norman's feedback principle warns that 'too much feedback can be even more annoying than too little.' During the active lease, the platform generates recurring feedback events: date confirmations, arrival notifications, cleaning reminders, payment confirmations, review prompts. If each of these demands the same attention as the initial move-in, the guest will experience notification fatigue and begin ignoring or resenting the platform. The emotional challenge is: how does the platform transition from the high-attention safety mode of move-in to the low-friction routine mode of an established stay? Susan's friend needs to feel that the platform supports her weekly rhythm without constantly demanding her attention.",
      "solution": "After the first successful week, the platform's emotional register should shift from 'protective guide' to 'quiet companion.' Notifications become shorter and less frequent. Weekly stay confirmations are a single line in the Stays Manager, not a push notification. Date changes (if the friend needs to adjust for medical appointments) use the same familiar presets from proposal creation, producing a feeling of mastery ('I already know how to do this'). Cleaning photo reminders, if required, are gentle and brief: 'Quick photo before you leave Friday?' not 'Reminder: Upload cleaning verification photos as required by your lease agreement.' Review prompts, following the micro-review pattern from prior design stack runs, are one-tap interactions embedded in the Stays Manager, not modal interruptions. The emotional principle is: as the guest's familiarity grows, the platform's presence should shrink.

      "problem": "Susan is performing an act of care: she is finding housing for a friend who is coming from Oregon for medical appointments. She is coordinating logistics, negotiating terms, offering to pay a deposit, and planning to set up all her friend's appointments. The platform's single-user model not only fails to support her operationally (as addressed in previous layers) but also fails to acknowledge her emotionally. Susan is a partner in this booking, not a side character. When the platform addresses only the guest-occupant and ignores the coordinator, Susan feels invisible. Norman's signifier principle has an emotional implication: when the platform does not signify the proxy role, it communicates 'this role does not exist here' which is emotionally equivalent to 'you do not matter.' The emotional challenge is not just accommodating the proxy pattern but honoring the human relationship behind it.",
      "solution": "The platform must acknowledge the proxy's role with emotional intelligence, not just functional support. When Susan selects 'Booking for someone else,' the platform should immediately communicate 'we support this' through its tone and structure. The coordinator's name appears throughout the booking: 'Managed by Susan' is visible on the booking summary. Status updates to Susan reference her role: 'Rita accepted your proposal for [Friend's Name]' not just 'Proposal accepted.' During the active lease, Susan receives coordinator-appropriate feedback that acknowledges her ongoing involvement: 'Your guest arrived Monday' or '[Friend's Name]'s stay this week went smoothly.' The emotional principle is: proxy bookers are performing an act of service for someone they care about. The platform should make them feel seen and valued for that act, not treated as an edge case or an afterthought.",
