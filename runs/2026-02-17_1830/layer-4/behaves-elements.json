      "problem": "Susan demands to physically inspect the space three times (2:14, 3:05, 3:42) because the listing cannot replace in-person verification. Bryant improvises a first-night cancellation guarantee (3:16) as a verbal compromise, but this affordance exists nowhere on the platform. The guest has no way to discover that she can leave if the space does not match the listing. Norman states that affordances must be discoverable and perceivable: 'If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required.' The cancellation guarantee is the single affordance that made Susan willing to proceed without physical inspection, yet it has no interaction pattern that surfaces it, responds to the guest's trust state, or adapts across journey phases. The interaction challenge is: how does the system behave differently when the guest is trust-anxious versus trust-satisfied, and how does the cancellation guarantee transition from a prominent safety signal to a background reassurance as trust builds?",
      "solution": "The cancellation guarantee behaves as a context-aware, phase-adaptive safety signifier that responds to the guest's trust trajectory. During listing evaluation, the guarantee badge responds to scroll depth: it begins as a static badge near the price, but if the guest scrolls back to photos more than once (a behavioral signal of hesitation), the badge subtly pulses once to recapture attention. During negotiation, the guarantee appears in the proposal summary as a confirmed term, not a policy footnote. During acceptance, confirming the booking triggers a success state that prominently restates the guarantee: 'You can cancel after your first night if the space does not match.' At move-in, the House Manual's persistent bottom banner displays the guarantee for 24 hours, with a single-tap 'Cancel Stay' action that opens a confirmation flow. After the first night, the banner transitions to a dismissible notification. The interaction principle is: safety affordances must be most visible when anxiety is highest and must gracefully recede as trust is established, but never fully disappear until the window closes.",

      "problem": "The Susan call operates at conversational speed: Bryant acknowledges every statement immediately, explains constraints in real time, and offers compromises within seconds. The platform's negotiation is asynchronous — proposals sit in 'pending' states for hours or days. When the phone call drops for 20 seconds at 2:42-3:05, both parties scramble with 'Can you hear me?' — trust erodes within seconds of lost feedback. Norman states: 'Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up.' The interaction challenge is: how does the system maintain the feeling of an active conversation when the actual response cycle is measured in hours, not seconds? Every moment of silence in the negotiation must be filled with informative, non-intrusive feedback that prevents the guest from wondering whether the system heard them.",
      "solution": "The negotiation timeline behaves as a living conversation thread, not a static status page. When the guest submits a proposal, the system provides three layers of feedback: (1) Instant acknowledgment (under 100ms): the submit button transitions to a confirmed state with a checkmark animation, and the timeline adds a new node — 'Proposal Sent' with timestamp. (2) Contextual prediction (under 2 seconds): the timeline displays 'Rita usually responds within [N] hours' based on the host's actual response history. If no history exists, use the platform median. (3) Intermediate heartbeat feedback: at predictable intervals (6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours), the system sends a push notification or in-app message: 'Rita has not yet responded. Most hosts respond within [N] hours. We will notify you immediately when she does.' When the host responds, the timeline animates a new node into view with a distinct visual treatment based on the response type: acceptance (purple), counter-offer (coral/warm accent to capture attention), or decline (neutral gray). Counter-offer changes are displayed as an inline diff — only the changed terms are highlighted, unchanged terms are dimmed. The principle is: asynchronous negotiation must behave like a slow conversation, not a silent void.",

      "problem": "Susan thinks in calendar months ('one month or two months,' 0:11) and weekday names ('Monday to Friday'). The platform requires night counts ('30 night minimum,' 1:35). Bryant performs this vocabulary translation twice during the call. Norman's mapping principle states that 'natural mapping, taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding.' The interaction challenge is not just the visual layout of the controls (addressed in Layer 3) but how the controls respond to input: what happens when the guest taps 'Weekdays'? What feedback appears? How does the system communicate the translation from guest vocabulary to platform units? How do the controls cascade — does selecting a schedule preset automatically update the duration calculation? The controls must behave as a single, coordinated system that translates in real time, not as independent fields the guest must reconcile mentally.",
      "solution": "The schedule and duration selectors behave as a coupled input system where every change produces immediate, cascading feedback. When the guest taps a schedule preset ('Weekdays'), three things happen within 200ms: (1) the preset pill animates to its active state (background color transition), (2) the translation summary bar updates to show the new calculation ('Mon-Fri for 2 months = 40 nights'), and (3) if a duration preset is already selected, the total price updates. The summary bar text uses a brief pulse animation (opacity 0.5 to 1.0 over 300ms) to draw attention to the changed value without being disruptive. When the guest switches duration presets, the same cascading update occurs. The 'Custom' option reveals a calendar grid with individual day toggles via a height-expand animation (300ms). On the calendar, tapping a day toggles it with a scale animation (0.8 to 1.0) and immediately updates the summary. If the guest's selection does not meet the host's minimum night requirement, the summary bar transitions to a warning state: the background shifts to a warm tone with a message like 'Rita requires at least 30 nights. Your selection is 24 nights — add 2 more weeks or switch to Full Week.' The warning appears within 100ms of the selection that violates the constraint. The principle is: every input produces immediate, informative, cascading feedback that makes the translation from guest language to platform language visible and correctable in real time.",

      "problem": "Susan's entire call is organized around preventing a catastrophic signifier-to-reality gap at move-in. Her friend is flying from Oregon with only the listing's digital signifiers as her conceptual model of the space. Norman distinguishes between 'knowledge in the head' (what the guest remembers from the listing) and 'knowledge in the world' (what is available at the moment of action). At move-in, the guest needs an interactive tool that bridges these two knowledge types — a structured way to verify listing claims against physical reality, item by item, with clear paths for each outcome. The interaction challenge is: how does the system behave when the guest confirms an item versus when the guest flags a discrepancy? How does the checklist adapt if the guest discovers the space does not match? The checklist is not a passive list — it is an interactive decision tree that either builds trust or activates the cancellation safety net.",
      "solution": "The move-in verification checklist is an interactive, step-by-step tool that presents each listing claim as a confirmable item, with branching interaction paths based on the guest's response. Each item (Private bathroom? Private room? Wi-Fi works? No unexpected co-occupants?) is presented as a card with two response options: a confirm action (check icon, green) and a flag action (flag icon, amber). Confirming an item animates the card to a collapsed, confirmed state (checkmark, green left border) and advances to the next item. Flagging an item expands a sub-flow: a brief text input ('What did you find?'), an optional photo upload, and two action buttons — 'Contact Host' (opens messaging with the flagged item pre-populated as context) and 'Review Cancellation Options' (scrolls to the cancellation banner and expands the cancellation detail sheet). If the guest flags more than 2 items, the system proactively surfaces the cancellation guarantee with a message: 'Multiple items do not match the listing. Remember, you can cancel within 24 hours.' The checklist completion triggers a final state: if all items are confirmed, a success message appears ('Everything matches. Enjoy your stay.') and the cancellation banner transitions to dismissible mode. If items are flagged, the system maintains the cancellation banner at full prominence and prompts the guest to resolve or cancel. The principle is: verification is not a formality — it is an interactive trust-building (or trust-breaking) mechanism with real consequences.",

      "problem": "Susan is booking for a friend from Oregon. She says 'I can give you a deposit on her behalf' (2:34) and 'I'm setting up all appointments for her' (3:58-4:31). The platform's interaction model assumes one user performs all actions. When two people share a booking, the system must route interactions to the appropriate role: payment confirmations go to the coordinator (Susan), check-in instructions go to the occupant (friend), and negotiation updates go to both. Norman's signifier principle requires that 'people need some way of understanding the product or service they wish to use, some sign of what it is for, what is happening, and what the alternative actions are.' In a proxy booking, the 'what actions are available' question depends entirely on WHOSE role the current user occupies. The interaction challenge is: how does the system behave differently for the coordinator versus the occupant, and how does it communicate which role the current user is operating in?",
      "solution": "When 'Booking for someone else' is selected, the system activates a role-aware interaction layer that routes actions, feedback, and notifications based on role. The role toggle at proposal start (two cards: 'Booking for myself' / 'Booking for someone else') uses a scale and background-color animation (200ms) on selection. Once proxy mode is active, the system behaves differently at each phase. During proposal creation, the form fields adapt: payment fields are labeled 'Your payment' (coordinator) while occupant fields are labeled with the friend's name once entered, or 'Guest' before entry. During negotiation, the timeline sends separate notifications to each role: the coordinator receives logistics-focused summaries ('Rita accepted your proposal. Payment of $X will be processed.'), while the occupant receives stay-focused summaries ('Your stay at Rita's condo is confirmed. Check-in details will arrive 24 hours before.'). During the active lease, the Stays Manager renders a role-appropriate primary view: the coordinator sees payment history, date change tools, and scheduling controls. The occupant sees the House Manual, check-in details, and review prompts. Each view has a toggle to access the other role's view ('View guest details' / 'View coordinator details'). Actions are constrained by role: the coordinator can pay and reschedule, the occupant can check in, upload cleaning photos, and write reviews. The interaction principle is: the system always knows who it is talking to and adapts its behavior, actions, and feedback accordingly — two users, one booking, two tailored experiences.",

Norman warns that 'hand-lettered signs pasted on products are the equivalent of poor design' — when you need to explain what something is, the design has failed. The interaction challenge extends beyond static signifiers (addressed in Layers 2 and 3): when the guest first interacts with the platform, how does the system behave to teach the non-continuous model through interaction rather than explanation? The guest's first tap, first search, and first listing evaluation must each reinforce the conceptual model through the system's response to their actions.",

Pick the nights you need — hosts share their space the rest of the time.' The overlay has a 'Got it' dismissal that uses a subtle scale-down animation (1.0 to 0.95 to 0, 300ms). It appears only once, on the first listing view. (2) First search: when the guest uses the search filter for the first time, the schedule preset selector includes a one-line contextual hint below the presets: 'Most guests book weekdays. Pick the nights that match your schedule.' The hint fades out after the guest makes their first selection (opacity 1.0 to 0.0, 500ms, with height collapse). (3) First proposal: when the guest begins configuring a proposal, the translation summary bar starts with a brief animated example before the guest has made selections: it shows a cycling display ('Example: Mon-Fri for 1 month = 20 nights') that animates through 2-3 example configurations over 5 seconds, then settles into the placeholder state awaiting the guest's input. This teaches the translation mechanic through observation, not instruction. The principle is: the system teaches its core concept through the guest's own interactions with it, not through pre-interaction explanations.
