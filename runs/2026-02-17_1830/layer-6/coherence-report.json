All new elements in this run follow the production Style Guide, which is consistent with the elements from the Nneka guest run. Recommendation: formalize the production Style Guide as the authoritative token source and either update tokens.json to match or archive it as a historical artifact. The one genuinely new color (--urgency-accent: #E85D4C) requires evaluation against existing signal colors before adoption."

The arc is distinct from prior runs: the Kahneman-lens runs emphasized cognitive ease and depletion-aware pacing; this Norman-lens run emphasizes clarity, assurance, and safety as evidence-based emotions rather than feeling-based ones. The two arc types are complementary: cognitive ease is the FOUNDATION (warm surfaces, familiar patterns), while evidence-based assurance is the STRUCTURE (verified photos, cancellation guarantees, chronological House Manuals) built on that foundation."

Both elements argue for being the first text element on listing cards. For shared housing guests like Susan's friend, space composition may precede schedule. For hybrid workers like Brad (Nneka run), schedule may precede space composition. Consider making the primary listing card element contextually adaptive based on the guest's search behavior."
