      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "negotiation", "acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "Susan demands to physically inspect the space three times (2:14, 3:05, 3:42) because the listing's current signifiers are insufficient to replace the affordance of seeing the space in person. The platform enforces a no-preview policy (anti-affordance) for the host's privacy, but this anti-affordance has no discoverable substitute signifier. Susan does not learn about the first-night cancellation guarantee until Bryant improvises it verbally (3:16). She does not see verified photos because none are presented during the call. Her friend is flying from Oregon — the cost of a wrong decision is an airline ticket plus the booking, making the stakes catastrophically high. Norman states: 'To be effective, affordances and anti-affordances have to be discoverable — perceivable. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required: I call this property a signifier.' The listing page must structure its trust information so that substitute signifiers for physical inspection are the first things the guest perceives, not supplementary details buried below property features.",
      "solution": "Structure the listing page's information hierarchy so that trust verification signifiers occupy the primary visual position, above property features. The hierarchy is: (1) Verified photo gallery with a 'Verified by Split Lease' badge and timestamp — photos must cover the exact elements Susan asked about: room, bathroom (1:08), common areas, building entrance. (2) First-night cancellation guarantee displayed with the same visual prominence as the nightly rate — not in terms and conditions, not in a tooltip, but as a peer-level signifier alongside price. (3) Host identity verification: verified name, photo, response time, and number of prior guests. (4) A brief explanation of the no-preview policy: 'For the host's privacy, tours aren't available before booking. Here is how we verify every listing instead...' This transforms the anti-affordance from a glass wall into a signified constraint with visible alternatives. The pattern is: explain what you prevent, then immediately signify what you provide instead.",

Norman's discoverability principle requires that 'it be possible to figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them.' Susan cannot figure out what the service IS, let alone what actions it affords. The platform's core value proposition — schedule-native shared housing where guests book only the nights they need — has no perceivable signifier that a first-time visitor can process without human translation. Norman warns that 'hand-lettered signs pasted on products = poor design' — when you need to explain what something is, the design itself has failed.

Not 'periodic tenancy marketplace.' Not 'schedule-native housing platform.' The guest's vocabulary is: nights, weekdays, months, private room. On listing pages, the identity signifier appears as a compact contextual badge: 'Part-time stay: pick your nights' — visible on every listing card and at the top of every listing detail page. In search, the available schedule pattern is the first filter dimension, not buried behind location or price: 'When do you need the space?' with presets for 'Weekdays,' 'Weekends,' 'Full week.'

Bryant performs the mapping between Susan's vocabulary and the platform's vocabulary twice during the call (0:19-0:35 and 1:35-2:00). Norman's mapping principle states that 'natural mapping, taking advantage of spatial analogies, leads to immediate understanding.' When the input controls use the platform's vocabulary (night counts, lease durations), the guest must perform a cognitive translation from their natural vocabulary (months, weekdays) — a System 2 effort that depletes the same resources needed for the actual decision. The proposal creation form's signifiers must use the guest's vocabulary as the primary framing, with the platform's internal units as secondary annotation.",

Schedule selection: provide one-tap presets for common patterns — 'Weekdays (Mon-Fri),' 'Weekends (Sat-Sun),' 'Full week,' 'Custom' — as the primary input. The custom option reveals individual day toggles only when the presets do not match. A real-time summary line below the selectors performs the mapping visually: 'Mon-Fri for 2 months = 40 nights, starting [date].'

At every exchange, Bryant provides immediate verbal feedback — acknowledgment, explanation, counter-proposal. The platform's negotiation flow is asynchronous: the guest submits a proposal, the host considers it offline, and the response arrives hours or days later. Norman states: 'Feedback must be immediate: even a delay of a tenth of a second can be disconcerting. If the delay is too long, people often give up.' The call demonstrates this directly: when the phone connection drops at 2:42-3:05, both parties scramble with 'Can you hear me?' — trust erodes within seconds of lost feedback. Every hour a proposal sits in 'pending' without informative status updates is an hour the guest's trust decays. The information architecture must replace the verbal negotiation's continuous feedback with a structured timeline that makes the asynchronous process feel transparent and progressing.",
      "solution": "Design the negotiation status as a visual timeline that answers three questions at a glance: What happened? What is happening right now? What happens next? The timeline has discrete states, each with a specific signifier: (1) 'Proposal Sent' — timestamp, summary of terms, confirmation that the host was notified. (2) 'Host Reviewing' — host's typical response time ('Rita usually responds within 6 hours'), last activity indicator. (3) 'Host Responded' — the response (accepted, countered, or declined) with specific details visible immediately. (4) 'Your Turn' — if the host countered, the guest sees what changed and what action they can take. (5) 'Agreed' or 'Expired' — final state. At each state, the timeline shows one line of what happened, one line of what is happening, and one line of what comes next. Intermediate feedback ('still waiting') fires at predictable intervals.

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_creation", "acceptance", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Susan is booking on behalf of a friend from Oregon. She says 'I can give you a deposit on her behalf' (2:34), 'I'm setting up all appointments for her' (3:58-4:31), and 'before she puts her tickets' (2:14). The platform's information architecture assumes a single-user model: the person searching, evaluating, and proposing is the person staying. Norman's conceptual model principle states that 'a conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works. It doesn't have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful.' The one-guest-one-user model is not useful when proxies are involved. The proxy (Susan) needs information about logistics, payments, and host communication. The occupant (friend) needs information about the space, check-in procedures, and house rules. If the information architecture does not distinguish these two roles, both users receive either too much irrelevant information or miss critical role-specific information. The proxy booking affordance exists (you can fill out forms and pay for someone else), but without a signifier indicating this is possible, Susan would either pretend to be the guest or abandon.",
      "solution": "Add a role-selection signifier at the start of the proposal flow: 'Booking for yourself?' / 'Booking for someone else?' This single toggle restructures the information architecture for the rest of the journey. When 'Booking for someone else' is selected: (1) The proposal form collects two profiles — coordinator (Susan: contact info, payment method, local presence) and occupant (friend: name, arrival date, needs). (2) Confirmation and status updates are sent to both users, but with role-appropriate content: the coordinator receives logistics and payment updates; the occupant receives check-in details and house rules. (3) During the active lease, the Stays Manager shows the coordinator a management view (payment history, upcoming stays, date change tools) and the occupant an operational view (current stay details, House Manual, host contact). (4) The information architecture constrains each role's affordances: the coordinator can pay and reschedule; the occupant can check in, submit cleaning photos, and write reviews. Neither is overwhelmed with the other's information.",

      "journey_phases": ["move_in", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Susan's entire call is organized around preventing a catastrophic move-in failure for her friend flying from Oregon. The friend has never been to the space, has no local knowledge, and arrives with only the listing's digital signifiers as her conceptual model of the space. Norman distinguishes between 'knowledge in the head' (what the guest remembers from the listing) and 'knowledge in the world' (what is available in the environment at the moment of action). At move-in, the guest's knowledge in the head is limited and potentially distorted. She needs knowledge in the world: how to enter the building, find the room, use the Wi-Fi, contact the host if something is wrong, and exercise the cancellation guarantee if the space does not match. The House Manual is the primary vehicle for this knowledge, but only if it is organized by the guest's action sequence at arrival, not by topic category. Norman: 'A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effects of our actions. Without a good model, we operate by rote, blindly.' A topic-organized manual ('Wi-Fi,' 'Appliances,' 'Neighborhood') forces the guest to search for the right section at each step. A chronological manual ('Step 1: Enter the building,' 'Step 2: Find your room') maps directly to the action sequence.",
      "solution": "Structure the House Manual as a chronological move-in sequence that maps to the guest's physical actions on arrival, with the cancellation guarantee as the most prominent element. The sequence is: (1) Access: building entry code, floor, apartment number, key/lockbox location. (2) Verify: a mini-checklist comparing listing claims to physical reality — private bathroom? private room? the bed and kitchen items shown in photos? (3) Connect: Wi-Fi network and password, host contact for immediate issues. (4) Safety net: first-night cancellation guarantee terms and how to exercise them — this is the most important signifier at move-in because it is the safety mechanism that made the booking possible. (5) Settle: house rules, shared space protocols, quiet hours, laundry, trash. (6) Explore: neighborhood basics, transit, grocery. Each section is expandable, one screen per step, with the current step always visible. Co-occupancy status is disclosed at Step 2 ('You may encounter Rita in common areas on weekends') because Susan specifically asked 'Would somebody else be in the place when she's there?' (1:20).",

These three questions — space type, bathroom privacy, and co-occupancy — constitute the guest's primary decision variables for shared housing. Yet conventional listing information architecture leads with photos, price, and location. For a platform where many listings involve shared spaces, the guest's first question is not 'Where is it?' or 'How much?' but 'What am I sharing and with whom?' Norman's signifier principle states that people need 'some sign of what it is for, what is happening, and what the alternative actions are.'
