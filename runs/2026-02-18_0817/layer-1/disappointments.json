  "disappointment_summary": "Roomster delivers enough speed and inventory to feel useful, but most high-anxiety moments are handled as user self-service rather than category-level design. Through Play Bigger's Chapter 1-2 lens, the pattern is consistent: the product optimizes lead flow inside an existing roommate marketplace frame, then exits before trust, commitment, and outcome loops are resolved. Nothing is catastrophically broken, so users tolerate it, but the experience repeatedly asks people to do the platform's hardest work themselves (risk assessment, terms alignment, conflict prevention, and post-stay learning).",
