  "crossref_summary": "Transcript evidence strongly confirms that the biggest Layer 1 disappointments are not theoretical: users repeatedly describe trust uncertainty, manual verification labor, and off-platform coordination exactly at high-risk moments. Hosts and guests both rely on ad hoc workarounds (texts, screenshots, external calendars, manual vet checks, personal legitimacy proofs), which mirrors the Roomster pattern of strong lead flow but weak end-to-end decision and commitment infrastructure. The calls also reveal two grounded extensions: a recurring legitimacy-proof burden before users trust the channel at all, and rescheduling failures caused by hidden cross-platform availability constraints.",
