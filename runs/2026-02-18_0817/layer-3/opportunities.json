  "opportunity_thesis": "Roomster's strongest capability is fast lead flow, but the validated pain shows the category still abandons users at legitimacy, commitment, and lived-outcome moments. Through the Play Bigger lens, this creates a clear opening for Split Lease to define a new category around trusted roommate decision quality end-to-end: prove legitimacy before contact, structure commitment before money risk, preserve coordination reliability during the stay, and compound trust from outcomes after the stay. The signature play is not 'better matching speed' but category ownership of safer shared-living decisions under uncertainty.",

      "the_signature": "Before chat begins, Split Lease shows a transparent legitimacy chain for each side: identity proof, role proof, payment readiness, and what is still unverified. The signature moment is that users no longer ask 'is this legit?' because uncertainty is made explicit and comparable upfront, instead of hidden inside bios and intuition.",
      "why_competitors_wont_copy": "Lead-generation marketplaces optimize for message starts and low-friction volume. A rigorous pre-contact legitimacy layer introduces operational overhead, exposes uncertainty honestly, and can reduce short-term conversion optics, which conflicts with volume-first business models.",
      "behavioral_framework_case": "Play Bigger Ch.1-2 argues category kings become synonymous with the defining problem. In this category, the defining problem is trust under uncertainty, not inventory browsing. Owning legitimacy before contact reframes the market around a new problem definition that competitors have not claimed.",
      "user_evidence": "Users repeatedly describe legitimacy anxiety at first contact: 'I don't know if this guy is legit,' 'there are so many scams around and I've already been scammed twice,' and 'I have to go and see the space ... to make sure that everything is legit.'",

First, Split Lease reframes entry around legitimacy so users start from evidence instead of suspicion. Second, it owns the commitment moment with explicit agreement states so high-risk decisions stop leaking into unstructured channels.\n\nWith trust and commitment architecture in place, Split Lease can outperform the category on reliability by making availability truth and reschedules operationally dependable. That reduces hidden coordination labor and prevents confidence erosion between intent and acceptance.\n\nFinally, Split Lease compounds advantage where competitors go silent: active-stay and post-stay. By converting lived outcomes into reusable trust and matching intelligence, the platform becomes the default authority for safer roommate decisions over time, which is exactly the category-king position Play Bigger describes."
