  "crossref_summary": "The transcript cross-reference produced extraordinarily strong validation. Of the 10 Layer 1 disappointments, 8 received moderate-to-strong transcript validation, with the Trust Chasm (disappoint-002) and Calendar Blindness (disappoint-009) achieving the strongest signal density. The transcripts did not merely confirm the analyst's hypotheses -- they deepened them. Users independently described the exact trust vacuum that Facebook Marketplace embodies, used Craigslist (which shares Marketplace's trust architecture) as their primary discovery channel and experienced its limitations firsthand, and revealed emotional states (scam anxiety, cleaning paranoia, ghosting frustration) that the Layer 1 analysis predicted but could not prove. Most significantly, the transcripts surfaced 4 new discoveries not present in Layer 1: the LinkedIn-as-trust-proxy workaround, the Airbnb-fatigue migration pattern, the cleaning-as-trust-signal demand, and the off-platform communication collapse. These new discoveries extend the competitive analysis beyond Facebook Marketplace into adjacent competitors (Airbnb, VRBO, Craigslist) and reveal that the trust vacuum is not specific to one platform but endemic to the entire category.",
