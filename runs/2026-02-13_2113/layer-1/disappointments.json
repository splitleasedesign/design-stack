  "disappointment_summary": "Facebook Marketplace's shared-housing experience is saturated with mediocrity that nobody complains about because nobody expects better. The platform's RPV configuration — resources built for general commerce, processes refined for discrete transactions, values calibrated to engagement metrics at planetary scale — produces a housing experience that technically 'works' at every touchpoint but delivers trust, structure, and relationship management at a level that would be insulting if users stopped to think about it. The disappointments cluster around three themes: the platform treats finding a housemate like buying a used couch (identity flattening), it abandons users precisely when stakes are highest (trust vacuum at commitment), and it has zero concept of an ongoing housing relationship (lifecycle blindness). These are not bugs. They are the predictable output of an organization whose processes were designed for selling furniture and whose values make it structurally incapable of investing in a niche that represents a rounding error on its P&L. Per Chapter 9's buying hierarchy, Marketplace has oversupplied on listing discovery functionality while catastrophically undersupplying on the reliability and convenience dimensions where shared-housing competition is shifting. Every disappointment below lives in that gap.",

They click the contact button. Facebook auto-populates: 'Is this still available?' The same four words generated for a $15 desk lamp. The user sends it. The host receives it in a Messenger thread indistinguishable from a friend's meme share. There is no structured introduction, no compatibility prompt, no 'tell the host about yourself' template. The first interaction in what could become a months-long cohabitation relationship is identical to the first interaction in buying a used bicycle. The user then waits, unsure if the host is ignoring them, hasn't seen the message, or is overwhelmed by 40 identical 'Is this still available?' messages from other people.",

When that moment is flattened to a generic auto-prompt, it communicates that the platform sees no difference between this interaction and any other transaction. It strips the user of agency in presenting themselves, and it strips the host of any structured way to evaluate whether this person is worth responding to. The psychological cost is diffuse anxiety: 'Am I just one of dozens of identical messages? Does this person even know what they're getting into?' This is what Christensen in Chapter 8 calls a process disability — Messenger's conversational processes were refined for casual social exchange and simple commerce, and they are 'intrinsically inimical to change' toward the structured, high-stakes introduction that shared housing demands.",

No verified identity beyond basic Facebook account verification. No response-rate indicator. No history of past housing transactions. No references from previous housemates. The user is being asked to commit hundreds or thousands of dollars — and their physical safety — based on the same trust signals available for someone selling a floor lamp.

There is no date selector, no day-of-week filter, no duration indicator, and no schedule-matching capability. The user types 'room available weeknights' into the search bar and gets a mix of irrelevant results. They browse listings manually, reading each description to see if the host mentions flexibility on scheduling. Most don't. The concept of 'I need this space on specific nights, not continuously' simply does not exist in the platform's vocabulary.

Chapter 9's buying hierarchy explains this as a market stuck at the functionality stage: listing discovery functionality has been oversupplied while reliability (trust) remains dramatically undersupplied.

Chapter 8's process framework explains this precisely: processes 'are defined or evolve de facto to address specific tasks,' and Marketplace's processes were defined for general commerce. When applied to housing, these processes flatten the interaction — removing the human, relational, and compatibility dimensions that are the actual substance of shared housing.

This is not a feature gap within an existing category; it's an invisible category that no incumbent recognizes.
