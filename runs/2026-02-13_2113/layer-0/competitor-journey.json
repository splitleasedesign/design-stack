    "lens_summary": "Facebook Marketplace's Resources, Processes, and Values are optimized for general-purpose commerce at scale, making it structurally incapable of building the trust architecture that shared housing demands — and its 'good enough' housing listings represent classic performance oversupply on discoverability while catastrophically undersupplying on the trust, commitment, and lifecycle management dimensions where the basis of competition is shifting."

    "primary_strength": "Massive distribution and zero-friction discovery — billions of users already inside the app, no separate download or signup required. Social graph proximity surfaces listings from friends-of-friends. Do NOT compete here.",
    "business_model": "Advertising revenue and ecosystem engagement. Marketplace exists to increase time-on-platform and ad inventory, not to monetize housing transactions directly. This means Facebook has no financial incentive to build housing-specific trust infrastructure — it would add cost without adding ad revenue.",
    "user_base": "Casual browsers who already spend time on Facebook. Skews toward people who stumble upon listings organically rather than conducting deliberate housing searches. Also attracts budget-conscious renters and hosts who want to avoid platform fees. Wide demographic but over-indexes on users comfortable with informal, peer-to-peer transactions.",
    "brand_perception": "Convenient but untrustworthy for high-stakes transactions. Users associate Marketplace with selling furniture and finding deals, not with making life decisions. There is a pervasive 'scam anxiety' — users know that Marketplace is full of fraudulent listings, ghost profiles, and no-show contacts, but tolerate it because the price is right (free) and the reach is unmatched."

      "what_they_do": "Listings appear in a dedicated Marketplace tab, in Facebook Feed via algorithmic surfacing, and through Facebook Groups (housing-specific groups like 'Rooms for Rent in [City]'). Users can also share listing links in Messenger. Discovery is passive and social-graph-powered — you see what's near you and what friends have interacted with. There is no dedicated shared-housing discovery flow; housing listings sit alongside furniture, cars, and electronics.",
      "quality_level": "excellent",
      "framework_analysis": "Chapter 8's Resources framework explains exactly why discovery is excellent: Facebook's resources — 3+ billion users, the social graph, algorithmic feed placement, location data, and Messenger integration — are unmatched and essentially unreplicable. These are resources in the purest Christensen sense: things that can be bought, hired, and deployed. No startup can acquire this resource base. However, Chapter 8 also warns that resources alone don't determine capability — processes and values must align too. Facebook's discovery resources are deployed through processes designed for general commerce (showing items algorithmically based on engagement signals, not housing-fit signals) and values that prioritize engagement metrics over match quality.",
      "what_nobody_in_category_does": "Nobody in the shared-housing category provides context-aware discovery that accounts for lifestyle compatibility, schedule alignment, or cohabitation fit. Marketplace discovers listings; it does not discover compatibility. The entire category treats housing discovery as a search problem ('find a room near work under $X') when shared housing is fundamentally a matching problem ('find a person whose life patterns are compatible with mine'). This is the mediocre coffee — discovery is universally treated as a logistics question, never a trust question.",

          "framework_interpretation": "The RPV framework predicts that Facebook will always win on resource-dependent capabilities like reach and distribution. Competing on discovery volume is competing on resources — the one dimension where incumbents have permanent advantages.

Facebook's values prioritize breadth of marketplace categories and engagement across all of them.

But the basis of competition in shared housing is shifting beyond functionality (can I find a listing?) toward reliability (can I trust this listing is real and accurate?) and convenience (can I quickly determine if this is a fit for my life?). Marketplace's search oversupplies on volume of results while undersupplying on reliability and convenience — the exact pattern Christensen describes as creating disruptive opportunity.",

Is this person safe?') and convenience ('Can I quickly assess fit without messaging 20 people?').",
          "framework_interpretation": "Marketplace is winning on the old basis of competition (volume of discoverable listings) while ignoring the emerging basis of competition (trustworthiness and fit-assessment efficiency).

Chapter 9 explains that when a technology oversupplies on one dimension, the basis of competition shifts to the next dimension in the buying hierarchy. Facebook has oversupplied on listing volume and ease of posting (functionality) but dramatically undersupplied on listing reliability (the next stage). A guest evaluating a shared-housing listing needs to answer: Is this listing real? Is this person safe to live with? Is this description accurate? Will this person honor their commitments? Facebook's listing evaluation provides zero structured mechanisms to answer any of these questions. The social profile serves as a crude proxy for trust, but it was built for social networking, not housing trust assessment.",

          "framework_interpretation": "Facebook Marketplace has pushed listing functionality well past the point of oversupply — anyone can post a listing in seconds. But this ease of posting is precisely what undermines reliability: because anyone can post anything, there's no quality floor. The very process that makes Marketplace excellent at listing volume makes it structurally weak at listing trustworthiness. This is a textbook case of Christensen's point that capabilities simultaneously create disabilities."

Facebook's existing processes cannot accommodate this without being rebuilt from scratch. Furthermore, Facebook's Values deprioritize building this: the revenue per housing transaction is zero (no fees), while the engineering cost of building a structured negotiation system would be enormous.

Facebook's values are calibrated to engagement metrics and advertising revenue at massive scale. Active-stay management for a tiny fraction of housing users is, by Facebook's values, marginal. It will never clear the prioritization bar.

The basis of competition for housing retention is not 'do you have new listings?' but 'can you help me maintain and deepen the arrangements that already work?'"

      "blind_spot": "Trust architecture native to shared housing — no platform has built a trust system designed for 'will I be safe and comfortable sharing a home with this specific person for an extended period?' as opposed to 'is this product/listing legitimate?'",
      "why_nobody_tries": "General marketplaces are structured around transaction-level trust (did the seller deliver?), not relationship-level trust (will this person be a good cohabitant?). Building relationship trust requires entirely different processes — ongoing review cycles, behavioral consistency tracking, identity verification beyond account creation — that don't exist in any marketplace's current process library. Per Chapter 8, these new processes would need to be built from scratch, which marketplace organizations are structurally unable to prioritize.",
      "framework_insight": "Chapter 8 explains that processes are 'intrinsically inimical to change' and that organizations' capabilities simultaneously create their disabilities. Every marketplace's trust processes were designed for discrete transactions. These processes cannot be incrementally adapted to serve ongoing cohabitation trust — they would need to be fundamentally rebuilt. Chapter 9 adds that trust in shared housing is where the basis of competition is shifting: functionality (can I find a listing?) is oversupplied, and reliability (can I trust this person?) is the new battleground. The first platform to satisfy the reliability demand will capture the market, just as Intuit's Quickbooks captured 70% of the small-business accounting market by addressing the convenience dimension that incumbents had oversupplied past.",

      "blind_spot": "The negotiation-as-product gap — no platform treats the housing agreement negotiation itself as a designed product experience. Everywhere, negotiation is either absent (Marketplace — just message the person), rigid (Airbnb — accept the host's fixed terms), or primitive (Craigslist — email back and forth). Nobody has designed a structured, multi-dimensional negotiation flow where both parties propose, counter, and converge on terms across price, schedule, duration, rules, and flexibility.",
      "why_nobody_tries": "Marketplace platforms are built on the assumption that transactions are simple: a good has a price, the buyer accepts or doesn't. Housing negotiation is multi-dimensional and iterative — it doesn't fit the 'list price -> buy' process that every marketplace uses. Building a negotiation flow requires designing for a fundamentally different transaction type, which means building fundamentally different processes. Per Chapter 8, existing marketplace processes cannot accommodate this without organizational restructuring.",
      "framework_insight": "Chapter 8's Values framework explains why no marketplace builds negotiation: negotiation adds friction, complexity, and development cost to a process that marketplaces have spent years simplifying. Marketplace values prioritize transaction speed and volume — negotiation is antithetical to these values. But Chapter 9's buying hierarchy reveals that for shared housing, negotiation IS the product. The ability to negotiate terms (not just accept them) is the reliability and convenience dimension that the market demands. This is where a disruptive entrant can establish an 'inadequate' product (fewer listings, slower process) that nonetheless satisfies the dimension that actually matters.",

Date changes, payment tracking, cleaning verification, house-manual access, stay-by-stay reviews, and dispute resolution are universally absent or afterthoughts.",
      "why_nobody_tries": "Marketplaces are transaction platforms, not relationship-management platforms. Their business models, processes, and values are built around the moment of transaction, not the months that follow. Building lifecycle management would require becoming a different kind of company — not a marketplace but a relationship-management platform. Per Chapter 8, this requires different processes and different values, which is why Christensen argues that spin-out organizations are often necessary for this kind of disruptive innovation.",
      "framework_insight": "Chapter 9's performance oversupply model predicts this blind spot precisely. The market trajectory for shared housing is moving from 'can I find a place?' (discovery/search — oversupplied) to 'can I manage the ongoing arrangement effectively?' (lifecycle management — dramatically undersupplied). Every marketplace is competing furiously on the old basis of competition (listing volume, search features) while ignoring the emerging basis of competition (arrangement management). Christensen warns that 'most well-run companies migrate unconsciously to the northeast, setting themselves up to be caught by a change in the basis of competition and an attack from below by disruptive technology.' That attack from below is a platform that may have fewer listings but provides dramatically better lifecycle management.",

Every platform assumes housing is a contiguous date range. Nobody provides scheduling primitives (nights-of-the-week selection, date swapping, schedule conflict detection) as first-class features.",
      "why_nobody_tries": "The mental model across the entire housing category — from Airbnb to Craigslist to Marketplace — is borrowed from traditional leasing: a tenant occupies a space continuously for a fixed period. The concept of time-shared housing on a recurring weekly schedule doesn't fit this mental model. No platform has recognized that a significant and growing segment of shared housing operates on schedules, not date ranges. This is a category-level assumption so deeply embedded that it's invisible.",
      "framework_insight": "Chapter 9 describes how disruptive technologies succeed by finding markets that 'value or accept' attributes that mainstream markets reject. Schedule-based housing is a market that traditional platforms would view as edge-case complexity — too niche, too complicated, too different from the standard booking model. But per Chapter 9, 'the weaknesses of disruptive technologies are their strengths': a platform built specifically for schedule-based housing would be 'worse' at traditional continuous-occupancy rentals but dramatically better for the underserved schedule-housing market. This is the classic disruptive beachhead — a market that incumbents dismiss as too small or too weird, but which, once served, creates the foundation for upmarket expansion.",

      "why_nobody_tries": "Modeling relationships requires a fundamentally different data architecture and UX paradigm than modeling transactions. Marketplaces are built on a listing-centric model (the listing is the primary object; users interact with listings).

No existing marketplace can retrofit this without rebuilding from the ground up.",

Christensen argues that when an innovation requires 'a different cost structure in order to be profitable and competitive, or when the current size of the opportunity is insignificant relative to the growth needs of the mainstream organization,' a separate organization is required. A relationship-centric housing platform is precisely this kind of innovation: it requires different processes (relationship management vs. transaction facilitation), different values (trust depth vs. transaction volume), and a different cost structure (investment in trust infrastructure vs. investment in listing volume). No incumbent can build this within their existing organization.",
