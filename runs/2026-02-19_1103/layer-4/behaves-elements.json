      "problem": "Prospects with incompatible needs (duration too short, lead time too tight) reach human agents before learning basic service constraints. Sophie Charvet called with a 1-month, next-week need and had to be told verbally she was ineligible. The interaction wastes both parties' time because the platform provides no automated stimulus-response-compatible feedback loop during discovery. The system's first interaction response to a mismatched prospect is a phone call -- the most expensive, least scalable response possible.",
      "solution": "Implement a lightweight, inline eligibility check that responds to the prospect's first expression of need (duration, timing) with immediate, non-blocking feedback about compatibility. When the prospect enters or selects parameters that fall outside service constraints, the UI should respond within 200ms with a clear, warm diagnosis -- not a modal blocker, but an inline state change that transforms the CTA from 'Contact us' to 'See what we offer instead.' The interaction principle is: the system should respond to incompatible inputs the way a good concierge responds -- immediately, helpfully, without requiring the prospect to ask. The response is proportional to the mismatch: a near-miss (5-week need vs. 6-week minimum) gets a softer nudge than a total mismatch (1-week need).",

This verbal redirect is structureless: it captures no email, offers no specific alternative, and provides no reason for Sophie to re-engage later.

This verbal explanation is nearly incomprehensible. The interaction challenge is: how does the system respond to the prospect's arrival at a listing page such that the co-tenancy model becomes comprehensible within seconds, without requiring the prospect to read a paragraph of text?

This interaction transforms an abstract schedule into a concrete daily narrative, one day at a time. The calendar also responds to the prospect's own schedule input: if the prospect has entered preferred days during search, the calendar highlights matches and mismatches.
