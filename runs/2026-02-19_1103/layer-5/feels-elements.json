      "problem": "Sophie invested the effort of a phone call only to learn within seconds that her need (1 month, starting almost immediately) was completely outside the service's parameters. The emotional experience was wasted effort followed by abrupt disappointment -- she felt purposeful and ready to act, then was told the service could not help her at all. The platform let her build momentum toward a goal that was structurally impossible, then halted her cold. This is the emotional equivalent of Thaler's door handle that says 'pull' when you need to push: the guest's emotional trajectory (urgency, readiness, hope) was incompatible with the outcome the system would deliver (rejection). Every second of false momentum before disqualification converts into frustration when the mismatch is revealed.",
      "solution": "The guest should feel informed certainty within the first 10 seconds of encountering the platform. Before any emotional investment in the service (browsing, calling, hoping), the guest must receive a clear, honest signal about whether their specific need can be served. The emotional principle is: respect precedes engagement. The platform earns the right to the guest's emotional investment by first demonstrating that it respects their time enough to tell them the truth immediately. For eligible guests, this creates confidence ('they understand what I need'). For ineligible guests, this creates respect ('they did not waste my time'). Both outcomes are emotionally superior to the current pattern of hope followed by disappointment.",

          "insight": "The agent delivers the disqualifying information apologetically but too late.

The word 'unfortunately' carries the emotional weight of someone who came with a real need and just learned they cannot be helped.

The agent said 'That's unfortunate that we cannot help you' -- emotionally appropriate but structurally empty. Sophie's response was gracious ('It sounds like a good thing you have'), but she left with nothing: no future path, no alternative, no sense that her time was valued beyond the courtesy of the apology. The emotional pattern is: you invested effort, we cannot help, goodbye. This leaves the guest feeling like an inconvenience to be processed rather than a person whose need matters even when it does not match. The Nudge principle of 'expect error' applies emotionally: the system should expect that some guests will not match and should make the emotional experience of non-matching feel cared-for rather than dismissed.",
      "solution": "The emotional principle for ineligible guests is: you matter even when you do not match. The redirect experience should make the guest feel that the platform took their specific need seriously, understood exactly why it did not fit, and offered something concrete for the future. This is the emotional difference between a closed door and a door that opens onto a different path. The guest should leave feeling that this was a helpful interaction -- they learned something specific ('my need is 4 weeks; they need 6'), they received something actionable ('here is what would match if my timing changes'), and they were invited to return on specific terms ('we will notify you when your timing works').

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "The co-tenancy model is emotionally charged because it involves sharing personal living space with a stranger on a split schedule -- a concept most guests have never experienced. Even the agent struggled to explain it coherently: 'the way we do it with the two people was complimentary schedule. So let's say for example, somebody needs Monday through Friday and somebody else needs Friday. So Monday they become, goes to amaze, which use the same space, but in different timeframes.' The emotional challenge is not just comprehension; it is the anxiety of committing to something you cannot fully imagine. Thaler and Sunstein's ice cream analogy captures the emotional dimension: choosing a familiar ice cream flavor is emotionally easy because you can predict the outcome. Choosing a medical treatment is emotionally hard because you cannot predict the experience. Co-tenancy falls closer to the medical treatment end: the guest is being asked to commit to a living arrangement they have never tried, with a stranger they have never met, on a schedule they have never lived. The emotional barrier is not information -- it is imaginability.",
      "solution": "The emotional principle is: the guest must be able to imagine the daily reality of the arrangement before being asked to commit to it. Comprehension must precede commitment. The platform should evoke the feeling of 'I can see myself doing this' through concrete, experiential representation -- not abstract explanation. The weekly calendar with interactive day selection serves this emotional function: the guest does not just read about complementary schedules; they manipulate them, see their own days light up in color, and experience the split as a tangible reality they control. The emotional target is the same as the ice cream store's free taste: the guest tastes the arrangement before buying it. Every moment of hands-on exploration reduces the anxiety of the unfamiliar and builds the confidence to commit.",

      "problem": "Creating a proposal for an arrangement the guest has never experienced requires configuring multiple parameters (start date, duration, days of the week, schedule pattern) from scratch. The emotional experience of a blank form for an unfamiliar choice is paralysis -- the guest does not know what a 'normal' configuration looks like and fears making a mistake they will not recognize until too late. Thaler and Sunstein's analogy of the restaurant default captures this: 'the default option is to take the dish as the chef usually prepares it, with the option to ask that certain ingredients be added or removed.' Without a default, the guest is being asked to give the chef the recipe -- for a dish they have never tasted. The emotional burden is not just cognitive load; it is the anxiety of making consequential choices without expertise. The agent in Sophie's call implicitly offered the emotional comfort of a default: 'minimum 6 weeks, 3 weeks from now -- is that going to work for you?' This verbal default offered the emotional relief of 'here is a starting point; you just need to react.'",
      "solution": "The emotional principle is: start the guest at a viable answer and let them adjust, never start them at a blank question. The proposal form should feel like reviewing a recommendation, not filling out an application. Pre-filled defaults derived from the guest's prior exploration and the listing's common patterns transform the emotional experience from 'I must figure this out from scratch' to 'someone who knows this arrangement has suggested a starting point for me.' Every pre-filled field is an act of emotional generosity: it says 'we have done the hard part; you just need to confirm or tweak.' The emotional trajectory should be: curiosity (exploring the calendar) leads to confidence (finding a viable schedule) leads to ease (seeing that schedule pre-populated in a proposal) leads to commitment (confirming with a single action).",

      "problem": "After accepting a proposal, the guest experiences the emotional relief of 'it is done' -- they secured housing. This relief is genuine and deserved, but it triggers what Thaler and Sunstein call postcompletion error: the main task feels finished, so attention to follow-up details (lease terms, payment confirmation, move-in preparation) drops precipitously. The emotional danger is not carelessness; it is the natural human tendency to disengage after achieving a goal. The guest who skips lease review or ignores move-in instructions will arrive unprepared, generating anxiety at the worst possible moment (first night in an unfamiliar co-tenancy arrangement). The challenge is that forcing the guest through post-acceptance steps risks converting their relief into annoyance -- 'I already said yes, why are you making me do more work?'",
      "solution": "The emotional principle is: frame post-acceptance steps as preparation for something exciting, not compliance with something bureaucratic. Each checkpoint should feel like getting ready for a trip, not signing legal documents. The forcing functions (gated sequence: lease summary, payment confirmation, move-in prep) are structurally necessary to prevent postcompletion errors, but their emotional tone must be forward-looking and celebratory. Each completed checkpoint should produce a small moment of accomplishment -- a progress bar advancing, a checkmark appearing -- building the emotional narrative 'I am getting ready' rather than 'I am being forced to read fine print.' The final state ('You are ready for move-in') should feel like the emotional peak of the sequence: all preparation is done, and the guest can look forward to arrival with confidence rather than anxiety.",

The ongoing benefit (savings vs. solo rental, schedule flexibility, guaranteed housing) is emotionally invisible because it is diffuse and chronic. Thaler and Sunstein's observation that 'every time the family uses a taxi, the cost will be in their face, with the meter clicking every few blocks' captures the emotional dynamic precisely: the guest feels the friction of each cleaning photo upload but does not feel the $780/month they are saving compared to a solo rental. Over time, this salience imbalance erodes satisfaction: the arrangement feels burdensome even when it is objectively advantageous. The guest's emotional experience is dominated by micro-obligations, not by the macro-benefit that makes those obligations worthwhile.",
      "solution": "The emotional principle is: make the invisible benefit felt at the moment the visible cost is experienced. At every friction touchpoint, surface one personalized, data-driven benefit metric -- not as a justification ('this is why you should not complain') but as a reminder of reality ('here is what your arrangement is actually doing for you'). The emotional positioning is gratitude, not persuasion: the guest should feel 'oh right, this is saving me a lot' rather than 'they are trying to make me feel better about this chore.' The benefit strip appears after the task is completed, not before -- the guest does the work first (no manipulation), then absorbs the benefit signal during the cognitive release after task completion.
