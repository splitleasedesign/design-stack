      "problem": "The platform's hardest eligibility constraints (6-week minimum commitment, 3-week lead time) are invisible during discovery. Sophie Charvet called and invested time only to learn verbally that her 1-month need was ineligible. Visually, this means the most critical qualifying information has no typographic prominence -- it is either absent or buried below engagement CTAs. The visual hierarchy inverts what matters: decorative imagery and brand messaging occupy the eye's first fixation zone, while the constraint data that determines whether the guest should proceed at all has no visual home.",
      "solution": "Establish a distinct typographic treatment for hard service constraints that commands the eye before any call-to-action. Use the mono typeface (IBM Plex Mono) at a prominent size for constraint data -- '6 weeks minimum' and 'Starting 3+ weeks from now' -- placed within the first visual scan zone of every discovery entry point. The mono face signals precision and non-negotiability: these are facts, not marketing copy. Pair with high-contrast ink on a warm surface background to ensure constraints register on the first fixation, before the serif headline or the CTA button. The visual principle is: data that determines eligibility must be typographically louder than data that sells the service.",

Tier 1 (diagnosis): state the specific mismatch in a high-contrast, left-aligned text block using sans body type -- 'Your need: 1 month. Our minimum: 6 weeks.' Use a subtle two-column comparison layout with the prospect's need on the left and the service threshold on the right, visually distinguishing them with ink-soft vs. accent color. Tier 2 (reframe): show the nearest viable alternative with a count in accent color -- '12 options starting in June for 6+ weeks' -- using the serif headline face to signal that this is a positive offering, not a consolation.

The guest's days should feel 'active' and 'yours' through color saturation and slight elevation (a subtle shadow-sm), while the co-tenant's days should feel 'present but receded' through desaturation and flatness. The day cells should use the existing day-badge component pattern (32px circles) but scaled to a larger format (48px or --input-height-lg) for the listing calendar context.

      "solution": "Design a shareable listing summary card that renders as a compact, self-contained visual block -- optimized for messaging app previews and mobile screens. The card should contain five information blocks in a fixed vertical stack: (1) a small co-tenancy calendar (7 mini day circles using the looks-003 color system), (2) location with transit time to one or two key destinations in mono type, (3) total price for the period in mono type at a prominent size, (4) key constraints (minimum stay, lead time) in a subtle row, (5) one or two listing photos at a fixed aspect ratio. The card should be generatable from any listing page with a single 'Share this listing' button, require no login to view via the shared link, and render correctly as a link preview in WhatsApp, iMessage, and SMS. Total word count under 50 words. No subjective descriptions, no login gates, no interactive elements -- a static, portable decision artifact.",

      "problem": "During the active lease phase, per-stay friction tasks (cleaning photos, arrival notifications, schedule coordination) are highly salient because they require active effort at specific moments. The ongoing benefit of the co-tenancy arrangement (lower cost than solo rental, schedule flexibility) is diffuse and easy to take for granted. Thaler and Sunstein's taxi-meter analogy applies: 'every time the family uses a taxi, the cost will be in their face, with the meter clicking every few blocks.' Per-stay tasks are the taxi meter of co-tenancy. The arrangement can feel burdensome even when objectively advantageous because the costs are visible and the benefits are invisible. There is no visual treatment that makes the ongoing benefit of the arrangement salient at the moments when per-stay friction is felt.",
      "solution": "At every per-stay friction touchpoint (cleaning photo upload, arrival notification, schedule confirmation), include a compact 'benefit reinforcement strip' -- a single horizontal bar that surfaces one salient benefit data point in mono type on an accent-light background. Examples: 'You have saved $2,340 vs. a solo rental this quarter' or 'Schedule flexibility: you changed dates 3 times this month at no cost.' The strip should be visually lightweight -- a single line of text in a subtle container -- positioned immediately above or below the friction task, so the benefit is salient at exactly the moment the cost is being felt. The data should be real, personalized, and updated dynamically. Use the mono typeface for the number (savings amount, flexibility count) to signal precision and credibility, and the sans typeface for the contextual label.",
