      "problem": "The platform has no automated mechanism to communicate its core service constraints (minimum 6-week commitment, minimum 3-week lead time) before a prospect invests time in a phone call. Sophie called with a 1-month need starting almost immediately and had to be told verbally that she was ineligible. This wastes both the prospect's time and the agent's time. The discovery experience sends a stimulus ('flexible housing') that is incompatible with the required response ('commit to 6+ weeks with 3+ weeks lead time'). Every ineligible prospect who reaches a human agent represents a failure of choice architecture, not a failure of sales.",
      "solution": "Surface hard eligibility constraints (minimum commitment duration, minimum lead time) at the earliest possible touchpoint in the guest discovery flow, before the guest can reach a human agent. This should take the form of a brief qualification gate — not a barrier, but a transparent disclosure. The gate should: (1) State the minimum commitment and lead time in plain language before any call-to-action to speak with an agent. (2) If the guest's stated need falls outside these parameters, immediately redirect to an explanation of what the service does offer and an option to be contacted when their need might match. (3) If the guest's need does match, reinforce the match explicitly ('Your 8-week need starting in June fits our service — here is what to expect next'). The pattern is: disqualify early, redirect gracefully, never waste a human interaction on information that should be automated.",

The system treats ineligible prospects as lost causes rather than as people whose needs might evolve or who might know others who qualify.
