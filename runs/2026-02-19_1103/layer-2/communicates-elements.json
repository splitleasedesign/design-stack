      "problem": "The platform's discovery-phase information architecture buries its hardest eligibility constraints (6-week minimum commitment, 3-week minimum lead time) behind a human phone call. Sophie Charvet invested effort reaching an agent only to learn in seconds that her 1-month, next-week need was entirely outside the service's parameters. The information hierarchy is inverted: the most disqualifying facts are revealed last, after the prospect has already committed attention and effort. Thaler and Sunstein's stimulus-response compatibility principle is violated: the discovery stimulus ('flexible housing') is inconsistent with the actual requirement ('6+ weeks, 3+ weeks out'), causing the prospect to 'blunder' into a dead-end interaction. The information the prospect needs most urgently to make a go/no-go decision is the information presented last.",
      "solution": "Restructure the discovery information hierarchy so that hard service constraints appear before any call-to-action, form, or phone number. The primary information layer at every entry point (landing page, ad, referral link) should state the minimum commitment and lead time in plain, specific language. This is not a barrier; it is stimulus-response alignment. The prospect's automatic system should receive a signal consistent with the actual service: 'Housing for stays of 6 weeks or more, starting 3+ weeks from now.' Prospects whose needs match proceed with confidence. Prospects whose needs do not match self-redirect immediately, without wasting their time or agent time. The pattern is: disqualifying constraints are primary information, not fine print.",

          "insight": "The agent reveals the two hardest constraints (3-week lead time, 6-week minimum) verbally during the call. This information should have been the first thing Sophie encountered, not the last. The entire call exists because the information hierarchy at discovery placed constraints below the fold."

Sophie's call ended with 'That's unfortunate that we cannot help you... if you ever need something in this type of arrangement, but it was a little more lead time. We'll be happy to help you.' This is a verbal dead end: polite, but structureless. No information is provided about what would match, when the prospect might qualify, or how to stay connected. The Nudge chapter on Structure Complex Choices warns that when the choice set is large, structure matters -- but when the choice set is zero, the absence of structure is even worse. An empty result with no explanation is indistinguishable from a broken platform.",
      "solution": "Design a structured information layer for every dead-end state that transforms 'no results' into an educational redirect. The dead-end screen or interaction must contain three information tiers: (1) Acknowledgment: state the specific mismatch in concrete terms ('Your need is 1 month; our minimum is 6 weeks'). (2) Reframing: show what would match if the prospect adjusted their criteria ('If you could extend to 6 weeks, here are 12 options starting in June'). (3) Future capture: offer a low-friction way to stay connected for when needs might change ('Leave your email and we will notify you when options match your timing').

      "problem": "The co-tenancy model -- two people sharing the same space on complementary schedules -- is an 'exotic flavor' that most guests have never experienced. Even the trained agent struggled to explain it clearly: 'the way we do it with the two people was complimentary schedule. So let's say for example, somebody needs Monday through Friday and somebody else needs Friday. So Monday they become, goes to amaze, which use the same space, but in different timeframes.' This verbal explanation is convoluted. The mapping between the abstract concept ('complementary schedule co-tenancy') and the lived experience ('you arrive Monday evening, the space is yours until Friday, someone else uses it on weekends') is opaque. Thaler and Sunstein's Understanding Mappings principle identifies this as the core challenge: when the mapping between choice and welfare is complex, the choice architect must translate abstract descriptions into concrete, experiential terms -- like the ice cream shop offering a free taste.",
      "solution": "Replace text-based explanations of the co-tenancy model with a visual schedule mapping on every listing page. The primary information element should be a weekly calendar that shows the guest's days in one color and the co-tenant's days in another, making the split immediately tangible. Below the calendar, provide a 'what to expect' narrative in daily-life language: 'You arrive Monday evening. The space is set up for you. You use it through Friday morning. Over the weekend, another guest uses the space.' This is the digital equivalent of the ice cream store's free taste: the guest experiences the arrangement concretely before committing. The pattern is: never explain the model abstractly when you can show it concretely.",

A blank proposal form is a 'required choice' scenario -- the guest must determine every parameter from scratch for an arrangement they have never experienced. Thaler and Sunstein argue that 'required choosing is often more appropriate for simple yes-or-no decisions than it is for more complex choices' and that 'most users do not want to have to read an incomprehensible manual to determine which arcane setting to select.' A blank co-tenancy proposal form is exactly the kind of arcane, multi-parameter choice where the path of least resistance -- when no default is provided -- is abandonment.",
      "solution": "Pre-populate the proposal form with smart defaults derived from two sources: (1) the guest's search criteria (if they searched for Monday-Friday starting June 1, those values should be pre-filled), and (2) the listing's most common successful configuration (e.g., 'Most guests at this listing book Monday-Friday for 8 weeks'). Present this as prompted choice: the guest sees a complete, viable proposal and adjusts specific fields rather than building from zero. Each pre-filled field should have a brief contextual label explaining the default: 'Suggested based on your search' or 'Most common at this listing.'

          "insight": "Without defaults, the path of least resistance on a proposal form is abandonment (close the tab). With smart defaults, the path of least resistance is submission of a viable proposal. Defaults transform the proposal form from a cognitive barrier into a confirmation step."

      "problem": "Sophie was searching on behalf of a visiting family member, not herself. The Nudge framework asks 'Who chooses? Who uses?' -- when the chooser and the user are different people, information architecture faces a compounding challenge: the information must be (1) comprehensible to the proxy who lacks the end user's preferences, (2) transferable so the proxy can share it with the end user, and (3) objective rather than subjective, since the proxy cannot evaluate experiential qualities on the end user's behalf. The current information architecture assumes the viewer is the future resident, relying on subjective descriptions and immersive framing that fails when the viewer is a proxy. Sophie declined the agent's offer to send information ('I won't read that myself') because the information was not structured for forwarding to the actual decision-maker.",
      "solution": "Design a transferable information format -- a 'shareable listing summary' -- that strips subjective framing and presents objective, decision-relevant facts that a proxy can evaluate and forward. This summary should contain: (1) Schedule: which days are available, in calendar format. (2) Location: address and transit times to key destinations (the proxy likely knows where the end user needs to go). (3) Price: total cost for the proposed duration, with no hidden components. (4) Constraints: minimum commitment, lead time, house rules summary. (5) Photos: the space as the guest would experience it during their allocated days. The summary should be shareable via a single link or attachment, self-contained (no login required to view), and formatted for both mobile and desktop scanning. The pattern is: when the chooser is not the user, make the information portable and objective.",
