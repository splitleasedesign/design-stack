The existing library element prescribes passing System 1's automatic assessment at every phase transition through visual consistency and familiar language. The new element prescribes surfacing hard eligibility constraints (6-week minimum, 3-week lead time) before any engagement to prevent ineligible prospects from investing effort. Both share the core principle: the system must communicate its fundamental nature before demanding the user's commitment.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence from Kahneman: System 1 generates impressions in under 2 seconds that determine whether System 2 engages. New evidence from Thaler/Sunstein: stimulus-response compatibility requires the discovery signal to match the actual service constraints. Combined insight: the discovery phase must pass both the System 1 trust check (does this look legitimate?) AND the stimulus-response compatibility check (does this match my need?). The Sophie Charvet call proves that even when System 1 trust is achieved (she called willingly), stimulus-response incompatibility still causes 100% dropout. Both checks are necessary; neither alone is sufficient.",

      "similarity": "Both address the problem of users facing complex, multi-parameter decisions without guidance. The existing library element prescribes smart defaults that produce good outcomes when accepted without deliberation, citing Kahneman's ego depletion research. The new element prescribes smart defaults for the proposal form specifically, citing Thaler/Sunstein's defaults chapter. The theoretical foundation is identical: depleted or unfamiliar users need pre-populated starting points, not blank forms.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: Kahneman's parole judge study shows depleted decision-makers default to denial (abandonment). New evidence: Thaler/Sunstein show that the path of least resistance dominates -- without defaults, abandonment is the easiest option. Combined: both lenses independently identify smart defaults as the single most impactful intervention for complex configuration tasks. The host lens applies it to listing creation (6-step wizard); the guest lens applies it to proposal creation (multi-parameter co-tenancy configuration). The principle generalizes: every multi-parameter form in the platform should arrive pre-filled.",

The existing element prescribes matching the platform's cognitive speed to the phone call's conversational speed. The new element prescribes concrete visual representations (calendar, daily-life narratives) to make the co-tenancy model comprehensible without verbal explanation. Both identify the same root problem: the phone call communicates complex arrangements in seconds, while the platform fails to achieve equivalent clarity.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: Andreas describes two units in 7 seconds; the platform must match this density. New evidence: the agent's 23-second verbal explanation of the co-tenancy model is incomprehensible even in conversation. Combined: some information (unit descriptions) transfers well from speech to digital if the platform matches conversational speed. Other information (the co-tenancy model) is so complex that even speech fails -- the platform must exceed conversational clarity by using visual representations (calendar, day-by-day narrative) that are impossible in a phone call.",

The new element focuses on creating emotional safety through immediate clarity about service constraints. Both share the principle that the first seconds of interaction must establish emotional legitimacy before asking for engagement.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: Kahneman's priming research shows that prior exposure shapes evaluation. The platform must echo the human call to inherit trust. New evidence: Thaler/Sunstein's stimulus-response compatibility shows that emotional signals must match outcomes. Combined insight: the discovery phase must achieve both trust priming (existing) AND constraint clarity (new). A guest who trusts the platform but discovers it cannot serve their need (Sophie) is just as lost as a host who finds the platform but does not trust it (unprimed Andreas).

If the calendar is built with the tokens.json green but the production environment uses purple, the calendar's color-coded day system would clash with the surrounding UI. The green accent is semantically appropriate for the calendar (guest days feel 'active' and 'natural'), but if the production accent is purple, the calendar would need its own semantic token.",

Recommendation: resolve the token drift at the system level before implementing any new visual patterns.",

The remaining 6 are genuinely new semantic tokens. Recommend adding constraint-bg, redirect-card-bg, and default-field-bg as semantic surface variants to tokens.json since they address distinct UI states (qualification, dead-end, pre-filled) that will recur across the platform. The card-share-width and card-share-photo-height are layout tokens that belong in a component token layer rather than the global token file. The checkpoint-active-border can be expressed as a border style using existing accent and radius tokens."

      "Minor: the discovery phase targets 'safety' while the search phase targets both 'safety' and 'relief.' For guests who pass the eligibility check (eligible prospects), the safety emotion at discovery should transition to confidence at search, not linger as safety. The 'relief' target at search applies specifically to the dead-end redirect path (ineligible prospects), creating a fork in the emotional arc. This is not a contradiction but should be documented: eligible and ineligible guests have different emotional arcs from search onward.",
      "Minor: the transition from 'curiosity' at listing_evaluation to 'calm' at proposal_creation assumes the guest has resolved their uncertainty about the co-tenancy model. If the interactive calendar fails to build sufficient confidence, the guest may arrive at the proposal form still anxious. The feels-003 to feels-004 transition depends on the success of the calendar interaction -- if the calendar is skipped or poorly implemented, the emotional arc breaks."
    ],
    "arc_assessment": "The emotional arc is coherent end-to-end and well-grounded in the Nudge choice architecture framework. The progression from safety (discovery) through curiosity (evaluation) to calm (proposal) to momentum (acceptance) to confidence (active lease) follows a natural escalation of emotional investment that mirrors the guest's increasing commitment. The arc's strongest feature is its treatment of ineligible guests: the safety-to-relief transition for mismatched prospects is emotionally respectful and distinct from the eligible-guest arc. The arc's weakest point is the calendar-dependent transition from curiosity to calm -- this is a single-point-of-failure in the emotional journey. If the calendar interaction does not build confidence, the entire downstream arc (calm, momentum, confidence) is undermined. Recommendation: ensure the calendar interaction is tested for emotional impact, not just informational comprehension."
