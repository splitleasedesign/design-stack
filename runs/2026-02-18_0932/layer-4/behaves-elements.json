      "problem": "The platform will send SMS messages to passive hosts across every journey phase (per works-0932-001). But SMS is an asynchronous channel with no guaranteed delivery, read receipts, or response timing. The platform must handle the full lifecycle of an SMS interaction: message sent, awaiting response, response received, response timeout, and error states. Without a deliberate interaction pattern, the platform will either over-prompt (sending follow-ups that annoy passive hosts) or under-prompt (letting critical actions expire without escalation). Surowiecki's aggregation condition requires that every participant's signal reaches the system -- but aggregation over SMS requires patience, graceful degradation, and intelligent escalation that respects the passive host's communication tempo.",
      "solution": "Design an SMS interaction loop with five states: (1) Sent -- message delivered, platform records timestamp, no UI change for 4 hours (passive hosts may not check their phone immediately). (2) Awaiting -- after 4 hours with no response, the platform flags the interaction as 'awaiting' in the agent dashboard but does NOT send a follow-up to the host. (3) Gentle Nudge -- after 24 hours with no response, send exactly one follow-up SMS, shorter than the original: 'Just checking -- reply OK to confirm your listing details.' (4) Timeout -- after 48 hours with no response to either message, categorize as 'no response' and trigger agent outreach (phone call or personalized text). (5) Received -- any host reply at any point in the cycle (even after timeout) is processed immediately and resets the interaction to 'complete.' The principle is: SMS interactions with passive hosts operate on a 48-hour cycle, not a web-speed cycle. Optimistic confirmation means the platform assumes the message was received and the host will respond -- it does not panic at silence.",

The challenge is designing a toggle that is (1) effortless for the 90% of data points that are correct and (2) functional for the 10% that need editing -- without requiring the host to actively confirm every correct field. Anthony's monosyllabic pattern ('Yes.' 'Okay.') suggests that he will scan the card and only intervene if something is wrong. The interaction must support this passive-confirmation behavior.",

The check-circle icon changes to an edit-2 icon (Feather). The field border animates from --border-color to --secondary-purple (focus state). (3) Save edit: pressing Enter or tapping outside the field saves the edit, transitions back to confirmed state with a brief scale pulse (1.02x for 150ms) on the check-circle to signal 'saved.' (4) Discard edit: pressing Escape or tapping the edit-2 icon reverts to the original value. (5) Whole-card confirm: a single 'Looks Good' button at the bottom confirms all fields simultaneously. For hosts like Anthony, this is one tap to confirm the entire listing. (6) Auto-confirm timeout: if the host views the confirmation card but takes no action within 48 hours, all pre-filled data is auto-confirmed and only missing fields (photos) remain as action items.

(2) Default permissions are pre-set to cover 80% of what agents need. No permission configuration UI is shown to the host at activation.

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "The Silence Interpretation Framework (communicates-0932-005) identifies a core problem: passive host silence is ambiguous. But the interaction pattern for the check-in SMS must handle not just the happy path (host replies YES/NO) but also the full range of responses: delayed reply, no reply, unexpected reply, and the timing of when to ask. The challenge is extracting one bit of information (satisfied/not-satisfied) from a host who may not reply at all, without creating the impression that the platform is monitoring or judging them. Surowiecki demonstrates that even minimal signals improve collective intelligence -- but extracting those signals from reluctant participants requires precise interaction design.",
      "solution": "Design the silence check-in as a three-stage interaction with binary routing: (1) Stage 1 -- The Probe: at the designated milestone (first month of lease, mid-lease, 2 weeks before lease end), send one SMS: 'How are things going with your space? Reply GOOD or HELP.' The two options are not YES/NO (which feels like a survey) but GOOD/HELP (which feels like an offer of assistance). (2) Stage 2a -- GOOD response: record 'Satisfied-Passive' status. Send no follow-up. Do not acknowledge the reply with another SMS (over-communication annoys passive hosts). The data point feeds the retention model silently. (3) Stage 2b -- HELP response: immediately route to the assigned agent with context: 'Anthony replied HELP to monthly check-in. Please follow up.' The agent contacts the host within 4 hours. The platform sends one auto-reply to the host: 'Got it. [Agent Name] will reach out shortly.' (4) Stage 2c -- No response after 48 hours: categorize as 'Ambiguous Silence.' Send one follow-up: 'Just checking in. Reply GOOD if all is well.' If still no response after another 48 hours, categorize as 'Non-Responsive' and flag for agent outreach. (5) Stage 3 -- Pattern tracking: after 3+ check-ins, the system categorizes the host's pattern: 'Always Responds GOOD' (retained, low-touch), 'Mixed' (needs attention), 'Never Responds' (high churn risk).",

The dashboard must not just show information -- it must guide action.",

(2) Each task card shows: host name + engagement indicator (looks-0932-003), task description in one line, time indicator (e.g., '2h overdue', 'due today'). (3) Primary action: tapping a task card expands it to show context (host's listing, last communication, relevant data) and action buttons (Call, SMS, Complete, Defer). (4) Quick-complete: swiping a task right marks it as complete with a single gesture. Swiping left defers it 24 hours. (5) Passive host flagging: tasks for hosts with 'Passive' or 'Silent' engagement levels are visually distinguished with a muted purple background (--bg-off-white) and a small SMS icon, reminding the agent that these hosts prefer text over call.
