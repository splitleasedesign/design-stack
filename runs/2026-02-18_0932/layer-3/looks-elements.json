      "problem": "The pricing interface currently presents the host's price in isolation -- a number in a field with no visual context. Anthony set $3,000/month without seeing how it compares to other hosts. Surowiecki demonstrates that crowd estimates are most effective when individual participants can see where they stand relative to the aggregate. But the visual must be radically simple: Anthony (AOL email, monosyllabic communicator) will not process a chart, a histogram, or a data table. The visual challenge is to communicate 'your price vs. the crowd' in under 2 seconds of visual scanning, using the Split Lease purple palette, without adding visual noise to the pricing step.",
      "solution": "Design a crowd range indicator as a single horizontal bar with three elements: (1) A thin bar in --bg-light-gray spanning the crowd price range (e.g., $2,600-$3,400). (2) A filled segment in --secondary-purple from the low end to the host's price position, showing where they fall. (3) The host's price displayed above the bar in --text-dark at --text-lg weight --font-weight-bold. The range endpoints displayed at bar ends in --text-light-gray at --text-sm. The entire component is a single line, no taller than 40px, fitting within the existing pricing field's vertical rhythm. No interaction needed: it is a passive display element. On SMS-based pricing confirmations, the visual equivalent is a text string: '$3,000/mo (range: $2,600-$3,400)' -- no image needed.",

      "journey_phases": ["onboarding", "listing_creation"],
      "problem": "When a passive host like Anthony encounters a pre-populated listing, the visual language must instantly signal 'review this' rather than 'create this.' Current listing wizard design uses empty input fields, placeholder text, and step indicators -- all visual signals of creation, not confirmation. The platform needs a distinct visual pattern for pre-filled data that communicates: 'We already know this about your space. Is it correct?' Surowiecki's framework supports this: in the Scorpion submarine search, Craven presented pre-formulated scenarios for confirmation, not blank hypotheses for generation. The visual must make the difference between 'fill this in' and 'confirm this' immediately apparent.",
      "solution": "Design a Confirmation Card pattern with the following visual characteristics: (1) Background: --bg-off-white (rgb(252, 250, 255) -- the purple-tinted warm white) to distinguish from the standard --bg-white of creation forms. This subtle tint signals 'content already here.' (2) Each data point is displayed as a label-value pair in a compact row: label in --text-gray at --text-sm, value in --text-dark at --text-md --font-weight-semibold. (3) A small check icon (Feather: 'check-circle') in --secondary-purple appears left of each confirmed data point. (4) Data points that need attention (missing photos, unconfirmed fields) use an alert icon (Feather: 'alert-circle') in --accent-coral (#E85D4C from proposed palette, or --protocol-danger #DC3545 from current tokens). (5) The card has a --border-color (#e5e7eb) border with --rounded-xl (12px) radius and --shadow-sm elevation.

Agents manage portfolios of hosts with radically different engagement profiles: some log in daily, others (like Anthony) never log in at all. Without a clear visual encoding, the agent cannot quickly identify which hosts need attention. Surowiecki's framework shows that the 'diversity of opinion' condition requires tracking the full spectrum of participation -- from vocal to silent. The visual must encode this spectrum without implying that silent hosts are 'bad' and active hosts are 'good.' Anthony's silence is a valid participation mode, not a failure state.",

(1) Active (--secondary-purple, solid filled circle): Host logs in regularly, responds to messages, manages own listing. (2) Moderate (--accent-purple, half-filled circle): Host logs in occasionally, responds within 48 hours, partial self-management. (3) Passive (--text-light-gray, outlined circle with small fill): Host rarely logs in, responds only to SMS, relies on agent. (4) Silent (--border-color, empty outlined circle): Host has not responded to any communication in 14+ days. The visual is a small circle (20px, --icon-sm) that appears next to each host's name in the agent dashboard.

The fact sentence uses natural case for readability. The action instruction is always the last line. This three-line structure is the SMS equivalent of the platform's scan order: header, body, CTA. For the platform's internal rendering of these messages (in notification logs, agent dashboards), the SMS template maps to the design system: CATEGORY in --font-inter --text-xs --font-weight-semibold --text-purple uppercase, fact in --font-dm --text-base --text-dark, action in --font-inter --text-sm --secondary-purple.",
