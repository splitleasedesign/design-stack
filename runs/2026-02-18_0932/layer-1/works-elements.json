      "problem": "The platform's data collection mechanisms (web forms, photo upload tools, review forms, dashboard interactions) are designed for self-serve, digitally fluent hosts. Passive hosts like Anthony -- who communicate via SMS, respond in monosyllables, and will not log into a web platform -- are effectively invisible to the system. Their local knowledge (space details, pricing rationale, guest satisfaction, retention intent) is never aggregated into the platform's collective intelligence. Surowiecki demonstrates that crowd wisdom requires an aggregation mechanism that captures every participant's signal. When passive hosts are excluded, the platform's data-driven decisions (pricing recommendations, feature prioritization, retention strategies) are based on a biased sample of vocal, engaged hosts. This is the equivalent of running Galton's ox-weight experiment but only counting the estimates from butchers, while discarding the clerks' guesses -- the crowd average becomes less accurate, not more.",
      "solution": "Build a parallel aggregation pipeline that captures passive host signals through their preferred channels (SMS, email, phone) without requiring platform login. (1) After each agent call, the agent's structured notes (price, deposit, amenities, guest requirements) should auto-populate the host's listing draft, so the listing wizard becomes a review-and-confirm flow rather than a create-from-scratch flow. (2) Implement SMS-based micro-interactions: 'Anthony, would you list your space again? Reply Y or N.' One-tap responses that feed the platform's retention model. (3) For photo collection, accept photos via text message reply to a platform number, with automatic upload to the listing. The agent sends a text: 'Can you send 3-5 photos of the space?' Photos received are auto-attached to the listing. (4) For active lease feedback, send monthly SMS check-ins: 'How are things going with your guests? Reply 1-5.' A single number becomes a satisfaction data point. The pattern is: meet the host where they already are (SMS), ask questions they can answer in under 5 seconds, and aggregate their responses into the platform's collective intelligence automatically.",

      "journey_phases": ["onboarding", "listing_creation"],

This data exists in the call transcript but will not reach the platform's listing database unless the agent manually re-enters it. The call and the platform are disconnected systems. Surowiecki's Scorpion submarine example demonstrates that the best collective judgments emerge when individual data points are systematically aggregated, even if no single person has the full picture. Currently, the agent has the data, the platform has the structure, and neither can complete the listing alone.",
      "solution": "Create an automatic data bridge from agent calls to platform listings. (1) After each agent call, the agent fills a structured call summary (or the call is auto-transcribed and parsed) that maps to listing wizard fields: price, deposit, utilities, amenities, parking, laundry, location, availability, guest preferences. (2) This data auto-populates a draft listing for the host. (3) The host receives a link (via SMS or email) to a pre-filled listing that requires only review and photo addition -- not creation from scratch. (4) The agent can also add photos received via text directly to the draft.

      "problem": "Anthony's entire relationship with Split Lease is mediated by agent Bryant. He asked zero questions, conducted zero independent research, and will accept whatever Bryant recommends. Surowiecki's core argument is that crowd wisdom depends on independence -- each participant's judgment must not be determined by those around them. When agents make all decisions for passive hosts, the platform's data (which proposals get accepted, at what terms, which hosts are retained) reflects agent preferences, not host preferences. This is an information cascade: one person's judgment (the agent's) propagates through multiple data points (passive hosts' outcomes), making the crowd's collective signal less accurate. If 30% of hosts are agent-dependent like Anthony, then 30% of the platform's acceptance, pricing, and retention data is actually agent opinion masquerading as host opinion.",
      "solution": "Design agent-mediated interactions to preserve the host's independent signal, even when the host is passive. (1) Before the agent makes a recommendation, present the host with a simple, binary or multiple-choice question that captures their independent preference. Example: 'These are your two guest options. Which matters more to you: longer lease or higher monthly rate?' The host's answer is their private signal. (2) The agent can then make a recommendation, but the host's pre-recommendation preference is recorded separately. (3) For proposal management, show the host the proposal terms in a simple SMS summary and ask for a 1-word response (Accept/Counter/Decline) before the agent weighs in. (4) For retention, send the host a direct survey via SMS -- not filtered through the agent -- to capture independent satisfaction data. The pattern is: capture the host's independent signal before the agent's influence, then allow the agent to help. This preserves both the agent relationship and the independence condition.",

This is the crowd average, presented as information, not instruction. (2) For passive hosts who set prices via agent calls, the agent can verbally convey the same data: 'Most hosts in your area are charging between $2,800 and $3,400.' (3) After a lease completes, show the host how their pricing compared to fill rates: 'Your listing filled in 3 days. The average for similar listings is 8 days.'
