      "evidence": "Anthony's entire call (6 minutes, ~15 words from Anthony beyond 'Yes/Okay/Got it') demonstrates that passive hosts exist as participants but not as contributors to collective knowledge. Surowiecki, Introduction: 'the crowd's judgment was essentially perfect' at Galton's fair -- but only because all 800 participants submitted their estimates. If 200 of them had been too passive to write their guesses on tickets, the crowd average would have been degraded. Anthony is the host who never writes his guess on the ticket."

      "phases_affected": ["onboarding", "listing_creation", "active_lease", "retention"],
      "evidence": "anthony-call.txt, 4:58: 'I could probably texting pictures.' Anthony will share his space data via SMS but not via the platform. Surowiecki, Introduction (four conditions): 'aggregation -- some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective decision.' The platform's aggregation mechanism (web UI) fails for Anthony's preferred channel (SMS). This pattern recurs in every phase that requires host input."

      "phases_affected": ["evaluation", "proposal_mgmt", "active_lease", "retention"],
      "evidence": "anthony-call.txt: Bryant frames every value proposition, Anthony confirms. 3:18-3:37 (payment guarantee framing), 2:09-2:51 (guest matching framing), 5:15-5:36 (fee structure framing). Anthony's 'opinions' are Bryant's opinions relayed through confirmation. Surowiecki, Ch 3: 'independence -- people's opinions are not determined by the opinions of those around them.' When agents mediate, independence is lost, and the platform's data about what hosts value becomes a mirror of what agents emphasize."

      "phases_affected": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "listing_creation", "pricing", "proposal_mgmt"],
      "evidence": "anthony-call.txt: Anthony's longest utterance is 'Yes, there's an offsite. There's a laundry bag.' (1:22) -- 9 words. His evaluation of guests: 'Two women. Okay.' (4:02). His pricing: 'Yes.' (1:00). His deposit: '3000.' (1:11). Every data point Anthony cares about can be expressed in under 5 words. Surowiecki, Ch 1: 'the simplest way to get reliably good answers is just to ask the group each time.' The platform needs to ask Anthony one-word questions that he can answer via SMS, not present him with 6-step wizards that require paragraph-length input."

      "evidence": "Anthony knows: his space's value ($3,000/mo), its limitations (no laundry, street parking only), its appeal (Upper West Side Manhattan, utilities included), and soon will know how the guest relationship is working. None of this knowledge will reach the platform in structured form. Surowiecki, Ch 4: 'Decentralization... people are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge.' Anthony is the ultimate decentralized specialist -- he knows his property better than anyone. But the platform's centralized input mechanisms (web forms) cannot capture his knowledge."
