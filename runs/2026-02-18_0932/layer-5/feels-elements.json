      "problem": "Passive hosts like Anthony will never feel excitement about a platform. They do not want a relationship with Split Lease -- they want income from their property with minimal involvement. The emotional challenge is not 'how do we make Anthony excited about onboarding' but 'how do we make Anthony feel that the platform understood him without requiring him to explain himself.' The current onboarding flow demands self-expression (fill out forms, write descriptions, upload photos), which generates the opposite emotion for passive hosts: burden. Surowiecki's framework suggests that the best aggregation mechanisms are invisible to participants -- Galton's fairgoers wrote a number on a ticket and walked away. They did not feel like they were participating in a statistical experiment. Anthony should not feel like he is onboarding.",
      "solution": "Design the onboarding and listing creation emotional arc around the target emotion of relief. When Anthony receives a pre-populated listing confirmation (via SMS link or email), the first feeling should be: 'They already know everything.' The listing shows his address, price, deposit, utilities, parking, and laundry details -- all captured from the agent call. The only gap is photos, and even that is addressed with a simple SMS prompt. The emotional principle is: the platform demonstrates competence by already having done the work. Anthony's role is to confirm, not create. This transforms the emotional experience from 'I have to do this' to 'They already did this for me.'",

The answer is not 'make him engaged' -- it is 'make him feel that things are being handled.' This is the emotion of invisible competence: the host feels confident not because they understand the system, but because the system demonstrates competence without explanation.

This asymmetry could make the host feel one of two negative emotions: (1) loss of control ('someone else is running my property') or (2) obligation ('I should be doing more but I am not'). Neither emotion is productive. For Anthony, the co-host relationship mirrors his current reality: the agent handles everything and he says 'Okay.' The emotional challenge is to formalize this dynamic in a way that feels like a partnership (shared responsibility) rather than a surrender (abdication of control).",
      "solution": "Design the co-host experience around the target emotion of trust -- specifically, delegated trust, the feeling that you chose to give someone authority and they are exercising it well. (1) Activation copy: 'Give [Agent Name] permission to manage your listing.' The word 'permission' frames the host as the authority granting access, not the passive party being managed. (2) Ongoing notifications use 'on your behalf' language: '[Agent Name] accepted a proposal on your behalf.' This maintains the host's position as the principal, with the agent as the delegated authority. (3) The monthly summary reinforces the partnership: 'Here is what [Agent Name] handled this month on 157 W 80th St.' The host sees a record of delegated actions without being asked to approve each one retroactively. (4) Deactivation is always one reply away: 'Reply STOP at any time to manage your listing directly.' This permanent escape valve prevents the loss-of-control emotion.",

This creates a subtle exclusion: passive hosts receive communications designed for engaged hosts ('Check out our new features!') that signal they are not the target audience.
