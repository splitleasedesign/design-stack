For each, ask: (a) 'What is your price?' (verifies they see their own price -- target: 100%), (b) 'What does the bar below show?' (verifies they understand it is a range -- target: >80%), (c) 'Based on this, should you change your price?' (verifies they interpret it as context, not recommendation -- target: >70% say 'no' or 'it is up to me').",
      "success_criteria": "The visual pattern succeeds if: (a) 100% of participants identify their own price, (b) >80% correctly interpret the bar as a price range for similar spaces, (c) >70% understand the display as informational rather than prescriptive (they do not feel they SHOULD change their price based on the visual alone). If >30% interpret the display as a recommendation, the visual or copy needs to be more explicitly neutral.",
      "failure_meaning": "If participants misread the bar as a recommendation, the visual hierarchy may inadvertently position the range as dominant over the host's price. Redesign: make the host's price larger, the bar thinner, or add copy: 'Your price, your choice.' If participants do not understand the bar at all, the visual metaphor (horizontal range) may be too abstract -- consider a simpler format like text: 'Nearby range: $2,600-$3,400.'",
      "implementation_hint": "Static mockups in three price-position variants. Remote unmoderated test (UsabilityHub or Maze) for quick, quantitative data on comprehension. Include a forced-choice question: 'This display is: (a) telling me to change my price, (b) showing me what others charge, (c) I am not sure.' Option B is the correct answer."

The journey-level risk is that the emotional experience feels disjointed: relief at onboarding, then empowerment at pricing, then confidence during the lease, then belonging at retention.

The test must validate the end-to-end emotional coherence for passive hosts.",

At each major touchpoint (listing confirmation, pricing, proposal, lease start, monthly check-in, lease end), ask the host to record a 1-sentence description of how they feel about the platform.

Enroll them in the SMS-first experience from listing creation through lease completion. At each touchpoint, add one diary prompt via SMS: 'In one word, how do you feel about your Split Lease experience right now?' Track the emotion words over time. At the end of the lease, conduct a 15-minute phone interview (not platform -- these are passive hosts) to understand their overall experience narrative.

If the arc is coherent, the individual emotional elements are validated as a system.",
      "failure_meaning": "If the arc shows emotion words that contradict the targets (e.g., 'confused' during onboarding instead of 'relieved'), the specific touchpoint needs redesign. If the arc shows no emotional trajectory (all entries are 'fine' or 'okay'), the platform is emotionally invisible rather than emotionally coherent -- it works but does not create any positive feeling. If the end-of-lease interview reveals fragmented narratives ('I do not really remember the experience'), the emotional design is too subtle for passive hosts to notice.",
