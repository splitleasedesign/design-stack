  "disappointment_summary": "Sonder's mediocrity pattern is the 'scaled assumption.' Every aspect of their experience was designed for a short-stay hotel guest and then scaled to mid-term stays without validating that the model transfers. The result is an experience that is uniformly adequate across all stay lengths but genuinely excellent for none of them. The coffee is not disgusting -- the apartments are clean, the keyless entry works, the support responds. But nobody has ever stayed at a Sonder for 30 nights and said 'this place changed how I think about living in a city.' Sonder built an outputs company (more units, more cities, SPAC IPO) when Lean UX says the only thing that matters is outcomes (happy residents who stay longer and come back). Their bankruptcy is not a business model failure -- it is a hypothesis validation failure. They never tested whether apartment-hotel is what mid-term guests actually want.",

There is no way to see the actual apartment before committing. No video walkthrough option. No 1-night trial that converts to a longer booking. No 'stay 3 nights and decide' mechanism. The cancellation policy provides some protection but cancelling means starting the search from scratch. The guest must make a high-stakes commitment based on low-fidelity information.",

Applied to the guest's booking decision: the guest is being asked to commit to the full product (30 nights) without testing an MVP (1-3 nights in the actual space). This violates the core Lean UX principle of reducing risk through small experiments. The booking itself should be structured as an experiment: try a small commitment, validate the hypothesis that this space works for you, then expand. Sonder asks for the full commitment upfront because their unit economics require longer bookings. This is optimizing for business output, not guest outcome.",

They assumed unit count drives guest satisfaction. None of these have been validated against mid-term guest needs. The bankruptcy suggests that at least some of these hypotheses were wrong.",
