The Relationship Timeline Card (this Sonder/Lean UX run) displays the ongoing relationship during the active lease -- weeks together, communication streak, milestone timeline. Together they cover the full relationship lifecycle: trust at decision (rb-ui-2201-001) and trust during stay (rb-ui-0901-001).",

This Sonder run identifies that relationship signals are absent during the stay (night 1 and night 30 feel identical). Steve Zhang's Sonder complaint ('who does this?') validates the during-stay void. The Zero to One framework says trust compounds as a monopoly asset.

Guest-works-005 (Stays Manager Emotional Arc) prescribes that the tone and content density should evolve across the 13-week lease: warm guidance early, efficient data mid-lease, grateful acknowledgment at close. The Temporal Stay Arc Banner (rb-ui-0901-002) adds a visible UI layer to this principle: a banner that shows the guest their temporal position ('Week 5 of 13 -- Getting Settled') and surfaces phase-appropriate content (neighborhood tips, host messages, extension options).",
      "combined_evidence": "The design-stack run (Kahneman/nneka) identified the emotional arc through ego depletion theory: early weeks need support because the guest is cognitively fresh but unfamiliar; late weeks need efficiency because the guest is familiar but possibly depleted. The reverse-benchmark run (Sonder/Lean UX) identified the same temporal arc through Lean UX's Continuous Discovery principle: the stay itself should be an iterative product that evolves based on where the guest is in their journey.

Together they form a two-part commuter discovery flow: category framing (why you need this) followed by action input (when and where).",

This Sonder/Lean UX run derives commuter identity from Lean UX's assumptions worksheet: Sonder assumed 'traveler,' but the transcripts reveal 'commuter.' Igor's customer discovery ('the responses were like, yeah, my commute is f***ing terrible') and Stephen Petronio's school commute story validate the commuter identity from two independent user segments (business commuter, family commuter).

The Sonder reverse-benchmark identifies that Sonder's model destroys all relationship context by routing everything through anonymous queues. Steve Zhang's direct complaint validates the pain. Lean UX's shared understanding principle provides the theoretical frame: persistent relationships produce better outcomes than transactional interactions.

It is a visible representation of the trust gate progression.",
      "combined_evidence": "The design-stack run identified System 1 trust gates from Kahneman's associative coherence research: unfamiliar contexts trigger threat detection. The Sonder run identifies that booking a 30-night stay based on photos and a star rating is asking guests to cross a massive trust gate without preparation. Lean UX's MVP principle (smallest thing to test a hypothesis) provides the solution framework: the trial night is the MVP that validates the stay hypothesis. Tamycka's transcript confirms Split Lease already offers trial nights.
