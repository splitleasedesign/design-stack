  "crossref_summary": "The transcripts strongly validate the core Sonder disappointments -- particularly the relationship void, the pricing opacity, and the hotel-vs-home tension. Steve Zhang's direct Sonder mention is the strongest single data point: he uses Sonder, finds it adequate but impersonal, and explicitly contrasts its transactional model with Split Lease's relationship model. Across guest transcripts, multiple speakers describe the exact needs that Sonder fails to address: wanting to 'feel like home,' needing to leave personal items, wanting kitchen access, caring about neighborhood safety and community. The host transcripts (especially Nneka's rescheduling discussion) reveal that Split Lease's relationship model -- where hosts and guests negotiate directly -- produces exactly the kind of continuous discovery and shared understanding that Lean UX prescribes and that Sonder's anonymous model eliminates. The strongest validation is for the 'Relationship Void' cluster: 6+ transcripts independently describe wanting a human connection in their accommodation that hotel-model providers like Sonder cannot deliver.",
