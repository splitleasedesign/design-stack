  "opportunity_thesis": "Sonder's bankruptcy reveals the endgame of building an 'outputs company' in mid-term housing: you can scale units across 40 cities and still fail because you never tested whether your experience model produces the outcomes guests actually need. Split Lease's opportunity is to become the 'outcomes company' -- the platform that treats every element of the stay as a testable hypothesis, every guest interaction as a learning cycle, and every week of a lease as an iteration on the stay experience. The five opportunities below exploit the structural gaps that Sonder's hotel-industry DNA cannot close: relationship persistence, temporal intelligence, hypothesis-validated trust, commuter identity recognition, and neighborhood integration. Together, they position Split Lease not as a better Sonder but as a fundamentally different category -- one where the platform gets smarter with every stay, the experience gets better with every week, and the guest feels known rather than processed.",

The host knows the guest by name. The Stays Manager tracks every weekly stay, every micro-review, every communication. When a guest messages about a maintenance issue, the host sees their full history -- 8 weeks of stays, consistently positive reviews, reliable check-ins. When that guest books again next quarter, the platform says 'Welcome back' and pre-fills their preferences. The relationship compounds. This is the structural opposite of Sonder's amnesiac model, and it is impossible for any operator-run platform to replicate because it requires a persistent host-guest relationship that master-lease arbitrage fundamentally destroys.",
      "why_competitors_wont_copy": "Sonder's master-lease model means there is no host. The operator is an entity, not a person. Building relationship persistence requires a real person on the other side of the stay -- someone who remembers the guest, who cares about reviews because they're personal, who negotiates directly. This is structural to Split Lease's peer-to-peer model. Sonder would have to rebuild their entire operating model to match it. Apartment-hotel chains (Lyric, Stay Alfred, Blueground) share the same structural limitation: corporate operator, no persistent human contact.",

Applied to guest relations: a persistent host-guest relationship builds shared understanding that eliminates the need for the guest to re-explain their needs at every touchpoint. Sonder's centralized support queue is the antithesis of shared understanding -- every interaction starts from zero because the support agent has no accumulated context. Steve Zhang confirmed this: 'their text conversations are -- you, if you don't respond within like 30 seconds, you're like, who does this?'",

Week 13 gets a graceful wind-down with stay-extension options. The Stays Manager evolves its interface, its tone, and its content based on where the guest is in their lease arc. This is not a feature -- it is a design philosophy: the platform should know how long you've been here and act accordingly.",

They scaled all four assumptions to 40+ cities and a SPAC IPO before testing any of them. The bankruptcy is the market's verdict: the hypotheses were wrong.\n\nSplit Lease's strategic opportunity is to be the anti-Sonder -- not by competing on the same dimensions (more units, lower prices, better amenities) but by competing on dimensions that Sonder's model structurally cannot reach. Relationship persistence instead of anonymous queues. Temporal intelligence instead of frozen experiences. Hypothesis validation instead of assumption scaling. Commuter identity instead of traveler identity. Neighborhood integration instead of apartment isolation. These five dimensions share a common thread: they all require a platform that learns, adapts, and compounds knowledge over time. Sonder built a machine for producing adequate apartments at scale. Split Lease should build a machine for producing increasingly excellent living experiences through continuous learning.\n\nThe Lean UX framework provides the meta-strategy: every Split Lease feature should be framed as a testable hypothesis with explicit success criteria. The trial night tests the booking hypothesis. The micro-review tests the feedback hypothesis. The Stays Manager temporal arc tests the engagement hypothesis. The commuter discovery flow tests the identity hypothesis. This discipline of hypothesis-driven design is what separates an outcomes company from an outputs company. Sonder counted units. Split Lease should count validated hypotheses."
