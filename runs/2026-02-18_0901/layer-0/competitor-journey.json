    "primary_strength": "Operational consistency at scale -- Sonder delivers a standardized, hotel-like experience in apartment settings across 40+ cities with keyless entry, professional cleaning, and 24/7 app-based support. The consistency is genuinely impressive. Do NOT compete here.",
    "business_model": "Master-lease arbitrage: Sonder signs long-term leases with landlords at wholesale rates, furnishes units to a standard template, then rents them out at nightly/weekly/monthly rates at a markup. Revenue depends on unit-level economics (occupancy rate x nightly rate - lease cost - operating expenses). This model creates a structural incentive to prioritize unit count over guest experience quality.",
    "user_base": "Business travelers needing multi-night stays (3-30 nights), digital nomads seeking apartment-feel without lease commitment, relocators in transition periods, and corporate travel managers booking blocks. Steve Zhang (Split Lease user) explicitly mentioned using Sonder: 'I also say to Sonder quite a bit, it's a bit cheaper than Airbnb.'",
    "brand_perception": "Perceived as 'Airbnb meets hotel' -- cleaner and more reliable than Airbnb, more spacious and residential than hotels, but ultimately impersonal. Users appreciate the convenience but describe no emotional connection to the brand. Sonder is a utility, not an experience people talk about."

Sonder's discovery phase assumes that guests discover accommodation by searching for a city + dates, identical to hotel booking. This is an untested hypothesis. Many mid-term guests (like Steve Zhang or the Split Lease divorced dad) discover their need through life events -- job changes, relationship transitions, custody arrangements. Sonder's discovery flow captures none of these intent signals. The Lean UX assumptions worksheet asks: 'Where does our product fit in their work or life?' Sonder never asks this question -- they assume the answer is 'travel accommodation' when for many mid-term guests it is 'life transition infrastructure.'",

      "why_nobody_tries": "Review systems across the category (Airbnb, Booking.com, Sonder) are designed as trust signals for prospective guests, not as learning systems for the operator or the unit. There is no feedback loop from post-stay insights to pre-stay preparation. This is the broken build-measure-learn cycle that Lean UX warns about.",

In the apartment-hotel category, the loop is broken: they build (furnish apartment), measure (star rating), but never learn (improve the next stay based on specific feedback). The 'measure' step captures insufficient data, so the 'learn' step cannot occur.",
