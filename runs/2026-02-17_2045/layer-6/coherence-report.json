The existing element derives from the andreas-call + Kahneman Part 1 and prescribes showing one total before decomposition. The new element adds the specific anchoring mechanism: the first number must be the paired-tenant monthly total because Kahneman's Part 2 anchoring research shows the first number becomes the reference point.",
      "combined_evidence": "Andreas processed pricing as a sequential sum (first month + broker fee + deposit = 3 months). Tammy rejects pricing because the first number ($2,500) falls below her anchor ($5,000). Both calls confirm the same principle from different angles: hosts need one number first. Part 1 explains why (System 2 depletes on multi-number processing). Part 2 explains the consequence (the first number anchors all subsequent evaluation). Together: show one aggregate number first, and make sure that number is the right anchor.",

The new element adds the theoretical foundation: Kahneman's law of small numbers shows that the platform was likely designed from a small host sample that excludes multi-property professionals, and anchoring predicts that time-to-first-listing multiplied by unit count produces an overwhelming estimate.",
      "combined_evidence": "The existing element derived from the andreas-call where Andreas had 2 units. Tammy has 13-14. Both need batch operations, but Tammy's scale reveals the catastrophic failure mode: 6-step wizard x 9 NYC units = 54 steps. The law of small numbers adds theoretical rigor: the design was based on a small sample and fails at the extremes. Combined: batch operations are not a nice-to-have but a structural requirement for the fastest-growing host segment (professional multi-property).",

Tammy's Airbnb betrayal narrative adds urgency: abstract trust claims trigger the Airbnb association ('they also claimed to be trustworthy').

The new element: the Airbnb availability cascade means System 1's first-impression evaluation is biased toward rejection.

Tammy's call reveals that professional recognition is not a moment but a baseline: she manages 13-14 units with professional infrastructure and expects to be treated accordingly at all times, not just in advisory moments.
