      "problem": "The current pricing information architecture leads with per-night rates, which anchors professional hosts on the smallest economic unit. Tammy's decision tree starts with 'Does this meet my monthly minimum?' — not 'What is the nightly rate?' Kahneman's anchoring research shows that the first number presented becomes the reference point. When per-night rate is the primary information, it anchors on $85, which primes 'small amount' and 'uncertainty.' The host must then perform mental multiplication ($85 x nights x weeks x tenants) to reach the number that actually matters to them. This cognitive burden is placed on the host at the exact moment when System 1 is deciding whether to engage. The information hierarchy is inverted relative to the host's decision hierarchy.",
      "solution": "Restructure the pricing information hierarchy to match the professional host's decision tree: (1) PRIMARY: Estimated monthly income (aggregate across all paired tenants for this unit), displayed as a single prominent number. (2) SECONDARY: How this compares to the host's stated monthly minimum or market rate, shown as a visual comparison (bar, percentage, or delta). (3) TERTIARY: Breakdown by tenant (Mon-Thu guest at $85/night, Fri-Sun guest at $100/night), available on expansion but not primary. (4) QUARTERNARY: Per-night rate details, seasonal adjustments, and occupancy assumptions — available in a detail view. The hierarchy inverts from bottom-up (nightly → weekly → monthly) to top-down (monthly → breakdown → nightly), matching the host's decision flow.",

The current proposal view likely leads with booking details (dates, duration, pricing) — which is the platform's transactional data, not the host's trust-evaluation data. When the host opens a proposal and sees dates and prices first, their System 1 has no trust data to work with, so it fills the gap using the availability heuristic: the most vivid guest memories available are negative (fraudulent credit cards at 13:31, local renters causing problems). Without a trust-positive anchor at the top of the information hierarchy, every proposal triggers the host's worst-case availability bias.",
      "solution": "Design a Guest Trust Profile that appears at the top of every proposal, structured in the host's evaluation order: (1) EMPLOYER & ROLE: Company name, job title, employment verification status. This is the strongest trust anchor. (2) PURPOSE OF STAY: Why they are in the city, duration of work assignment, and project type. This provides context that makes the guest's presence legible and predictable. (3) ORIGIN: Home city and state. Non-local origin is a positive signal for Tammy ('they're not going to stay there permanently'). (4) PAYMENT STATUS: Pre-authorization status, deposit readiness, payment method. This confirms ability to pay without requiring the host to investigate. Only after this trust profile does the proposal show booking details (dates, duration, pricing). The trust profile acts as a priming anchor that activates 'reliable professional' associations before the host encounters any transactional data.",

Kahneman's research on priming shows that System 1 categorization happens before conscious evaluation. If Split Lease's first-scan information (the content visible without scrolling or clicking) does not explicitly signal differentiation from Airbnb, the host's System 1 categorizes it as 'another Airbnb' and subsequent information is processed through the negative filter. The current first-scan information likely includes standard platform elements (search, listings, ratings) that are visually and structurally similar to Airbnb, triggering the category association.",
      "solution": "Place explicit differentiation signals in the first-scan position (visible without scrolling on first visit). Three critical signals based on Tammy's specific Airbnb grievances: (1) HOST POLICY CONTROL: 'You set your policies. We enforce them.' This directly counters Airbnb's policy-override behavior, which is Tammy's primary complaint. (2) GUARANTEED INCOME: 'Your minimum monthly income, guaranteed by paired tenants.' This addresses the income uncertainty that makes Airbnb feel unreliable. (3) NO UNILATERAL CANCELLATION: 'Your bookings are protected. We don't cancel on behalf of guests.' This counters the pandemic cancellation betrayal. These signals must be in the first-scan position — the area visible within 2 seconds of page load, before any scrolling. They serve as category-breaking anchors that prevent the Airbnb association from forming.",

The current dashboard likely shows individual listings, forcing her to mentally aggregate across pages to understand her portfolio performance. This forces unnecessary cognitive load and prevents the formation of a positive 'portfolio income' anchor. Kahneman's availability heuristic predicts that the most recently viewed listing (which might be underperforming) will disproportionately influence her assessment of the entire platform. Without a portfolio-level view, each individual listing's performance is evaluated in isolation, and one underperforming unit makes all of Split Lease feel unsuccessful.",

(2) SECONDARY: Income per unit as a compact list or grid, each showing monthly total and occupancy percentage. (3) TERTIARY: Comparison against the host's stated monthly minimums (green if meeting anchor, amber if close, red if below). (4) QUARTERNARY: Detailed per-unit booking history, available on drill-down. The portfolio dashboard ensures that every visit to the platform begins with the aggregate number, not with individual listings.

Each of these represents a concrete risk mitigation she can see and control. The platform must communicate its own risk-reduction measures with equivalent specificity and concreteness, or the host perceives the platform as less safe than her existing system. Kahneman's research shows that abstract reassurances ('your property is protected') are processed differently from concrete mechanisms ('if the guest does not pay, we debit their pre-authorized deposit within 24 hours'). Availability bias means concrete mechanisms are more memorable and emotionally reassuring than abstract promises.",
      "solution": "Present platform risk-reduction measures as a concrete evidence ladder, each rung matching one of the host's existing risk-mitigation tools: (1) PAYMENT SECURITY: 'Payments are collected upfront before the guest arrives. Funds are held in escrow and released to you on [schedule].' This mirrors her Zelle upfront-payment model. (2) GUEST VERIFICATION: 'Every guest provides employer verification, government ID, and purpose of stay before their proposal reaches you.' This mirrors her vetting checklist. (3) ACCESS CONTROL: 'Electronic lock codes are generated per stay and expire automatically.' This mirrors her electronic lock system. (4) DISPUTE RESOLUTION: 'You set your policies. If a guest violates them, we enforce your terms — not ours.' This counters the Airbnb policy-override fear. Each rung provides a concrete mechanism, not an abstract promise.
