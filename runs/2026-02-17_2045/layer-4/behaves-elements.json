      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "pricing"],
      "problem": "When Tammy encounters Split Lease pricing, her System 1 anchors on the first number she sees. If that number is a per-night rate ($85) or a single-tenant monthly total ($2,500), her $5,000/month anchor triggers immediate rejection. The current pricing interaction likely presents rates in a static format, forcing the host to mentally compute paired-tenant totals. This computation never happens because the anchoring rejection occurs before System 2 engages. The interaction must dynamically present the paired-tenant monthly aggregate as the first visible number and update it in real time as the host adjusts parameters.",
      "solution": "Design an interactive pricing calculator that leads with the aggregate monthly income and responds instantly to host inputs. The host inputs her monthly minimum ($5,000), and the calculator immediately shows how many paired tenants are needed to reach it, with the total updating in real time as parameters change. The interaction flow: (1) Host enters or confirms monthly minimum — this becomes the target anchor displayed prominently. (2) System shows current paired-tenant configuration and projected monthly total. (3) Host can adjust nightly rate, tenant count, and schedule split — each adjustment instantly recalculates and updates the prominent monthly total. (4) When the projected total meets or exceeds the host's minimum, the interaction provides a visual confirmation (color shift, checkmark). The key interaction principle: the monthly total updates within 100ms of any input change, maintaining anchoring continuity.",

In October/November, the platform sends a pre-formatted activation notification: 'Your January-April vacancy window is approaching.

The interaction: (1) Notification arrives with a specific income projection and a single CTA.
