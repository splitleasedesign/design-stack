      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "pricing", "retention"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's anchoring research demonstrates that the first number presented becomes the reference point for all subsequent judgments. Visually, anchoring is amplified by typographic weight: larger, bolder numbers are perceived as more important and become stronger anchors. When per-night rates are displayed in the same typographic weight as monthly totals, the host's eye has no visual hierarchy to guide it toward the number that matters most ($5,000/month total vs. $85/night). The current pricing typography likely treats all numbers with equal visual weight, losing the opportunity to use typographic scale as an anchoring mechanism. Tammy needs to see one number — the paired-tenant monthly total — that dominates the visual field and becomes her anchor.",
      "solution": "Apply a dramatic typographic scale differential between the primary income anchor and secondary price details. The monthly total should be displayed at 36px (--text-4xl) in Inter Bold 700, using --primary-purple (#31135D) to signal authority and brand alignment. Secondary details (per-night rate, per-tenant breakdown) should use 14px (--text-base) in --text-gray (#6b7280). The visual scale ratio should be at least 2.5:1 (36px/14px) to create an unmistakable visual hierarchy. The primary number should have additional spacing above and below (--spacing-3xl) to create breathing room that draws the eye. This is visual anchoring: the largest, boldest, most prominent number on any pricing screen becomes the anchor that the host's System 1 latches onto.",

Kahneman's priming research shows that visual elements activate associative networks: if the platform looks like Airbnb, it is Airbnb in System 1's assessment.

The platform needs a distinctive visual language that immediately signals 'this is a different kind of platform' — one that serves hosts, not guests. The visual signal must be so prominent that it registers in the first 2 seconds before any text is read.",
      "solution": "Create a distinctive 'Host Control Signal' visual pattern using a left-border accent on trust-related cards and sections. Each trust commitment (host policy control, income guarantee, no unilateral cancellation) should appear in a card with a 3px left border in --secondary-purple (rgb(109, 49, 194)). The card background should be --bg-off-white (rgb(252, 250, 255)) — the purple-tinted off-white that creates a subtle but distinctive warm feel unlike Airbnb's neutral white. Icons should use Feather icons at --icon-md (24px) in --primary-purple.
