      "problem": "Tammy's emotional state during pricing is protective and frustrated. Her $5,000/month anchor is not a negotiating position — it is her livelihood floor. When the first number she sees ($2,500/month single-tenant equivalent) falls below this anchor, the emotional response is not disappointment but threat. The affect heuristic converts this financial shortfall into a global negative judgment: the platform is not just inadequate on pricing but inadequate as a whole. 'The math doesn't add up' at 02:09 is not an analytical statement — it is an emotional rejection wrapped in numerical language. No amount of subsequent explanation can fully repair the damage of a first number that triggers financial threat.",
      "solution": "Design the pricing moment so that the first number the host encounters meets or exceeds her stated minimum. If the paired-tenant total for her unit genuinely reaches $5,000/month, show that number first. If it does not, show it relative to her vacancy alternative ($0/month during January-April) rather than relative to her peak-season anchor ($5,000/month). The emotional principle: never let the first number trigger threat. If the number is lower than the anchor, reframe the comparison before displaying the number. 'During your vacant months, Split Lease projects $3,200/month' is emotionally different from '$3,200/month from Split Lease' because the comparison anchor has been shifted from $5,000 (threat) to $0 (relief).",

Every platform interaction begins from a deficit of trust, not a position of neutrality.

Concrete implementation: (1) The first interactive element is a policy control, not a listing form. (2) Every automated message includes 'as per your rules' to reinforce sovereignty. (3) The platform never overrides a host decision without explicit consent. (4) When conflicts arise (guest dispute, cancellation request), the first communication to the host is: 'Here is what happened.

The comparison is to $0 (the actual alternative), not to $5,000 (the peak-season anchor). (2) During the season: Show income accumulating in real time. A running total that updates after each booking payment creates positive availability — the host can recall specific moments when money arrived during a previously dead month. (3) After the season: Present a seasonal summary that shows total vacancy-season income as a lump sum: 'January-April 2026: $12,800 earned from previously vacant months.'

      "problem": "Kahneman's law of small numbers predicts that Tammy will judge Split Lease based on her first 1-2 experiences, treating this tiny sample as representative of the platform's entire value. If the first proposal is from a weak guest (local, unverified employer, uncertain payment), she will generalize: 'Split Lease sends bad guests.' If the first vacancy-season month earns below her anchor, she will generalize: 'Split Lease does not work.' This judgment is sticky — subsequent positive experiences will be insufficiently weighted because the first experience anchored her assessment. The emotional challenge is that the platform gets effectively one chance to pass the 'small sample' judgment.",
      "solution": "Design the first experience to be disproportionately excellent. This is not about manipulation — it is about ensuring that the first data point accurately represents the platform's capability, rather than the random variability that small samples inevitably contain. Concrete implementation: (1) Curate the first proposal: ensure the first guest presented to a professional host matches her vetting criteria (employed professional, non-local, verifiable employer). If no perfect match exists, delay the first proposal rather than sending a weak one. (2) Curate the first vacancy-season booking: if the platform subsidizes matching to guarantee a strong first booking, the cost is trivial compared to losing a 13-unit professional host. (3) After the first experience, explicitly contextualize it: 'This is your first booking. Here is what a typical month looks like.' Set expectations that reduce the anchoring of the first sample. (4) The emotional principle: the first experience creates a memory that is disproportionately available and emotionally charged. Make it the best possible representation of the platform.",
