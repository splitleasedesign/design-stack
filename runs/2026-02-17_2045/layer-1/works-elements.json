      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "pricing", "proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "Split Lease presents pricing as a per-night rate, which translates to approximately $2,500/month for a single tenant. Professional multi-property hosts like Tammy anchor on monthly totals ($5,000/month for 2BR). Kahneman's anchoring research demonstrates that the first number presented becomes the reference point against which all subsequent estimates are compared. When Split Lease leads with per-night or single-tenant monthly figures, it anchors the host on a number that is 50% below their minimum, triggering immediate System 1 rejection. The platform currently has no mechanism to present the paired-tenant total as the primary pricing anchor. The host sees $85/night or $2,500/month first and rejects before discovering the paired-tenant math.",
      "solution": "Restructure the pricing presentation to lead with the paired-tenant monthly total as the primary anchor. The first number any professional host sees should be the aggregate monthly income from all tenants sharing the unit. For Tammy's 2BR: if Monday-Thursday tenant pays $85/night x 4 nights x 4 weeks = $1,360/month, and Friday-Sunday tenant pays $100/night x 3 nights x 4 weeks = $1,200/month, plus a second Mon-Thu tenant at $85/night x 4 = $1,360/month, the total is $3,920/month — still below her anchor but closer. The platform must (1) show the total first, (2) break it down by tenant only when the host drills in, (3) provide a 'monthly income calculator' that lets the host input their minimum and see how many paired tenants are needed to reach it, (4) compare the paired total against the host's stated monthly anchor explicitly. Moving first with a high anchor is Kahneman's key negotiation insight.",

      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "pricing", "active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "Tammy's $5,000/month anchor makes year-round Split Lease adoption nearly impossible — the per-night model rarely reaches this anchor. However, during her vacancy season (January-April), the anchor weakens because the alternative is $0/month, not $5,000/month. Kahneman's research on anchoring adjustment shows that people adjust from an anchor in the correct direction but stop too early. If the initial experience anchors on a successful vacancy-season booking at $2,500-3,000/month (which feels great during a vacant period), this success becomes the new anchor from which the host adjusts upward when evaluating year-round use. The availability heuristic also shifts: a concrete positive Split Lease experience replaces the abstract negative platform associations. The current platform has no mechanism to identify, target, or optimize for seasonal vacancy periods.",
      "solution": "Design a seasonal entry funnel specifically for professional hosts with predictable vacancy periods. The process: (1) During onboarding, ask professional hosts to identify their typical low-occupancy months. (2) Position Split Lease as a vacancy-filling supplement, not a primary booking channel — this frames the platform as risk-free ('you have nothing to lose during months you're empty anyway'). (3) Guarantee a first booking during the identified vacancy period, even if it requires platform subsidization or priority matching. (4) After the first successful vacancy-season lease, present data showing what the same unit could earn during shoulder season with paired tenants — this is the graduated anchor escalation. (5) Over time, move the host from vacancy-only to shoulder-season to year-round as each successful experience anchors higher income expectations. The graduation from $0→$2,500→$3,500→$5,000+ follows the adjustment path that Kahneman describes, but with real experiences replacing imagined calculations.",

      "problem": "Tammy has experienced an availability cascade around platform distrust: vivid Airbnb failures (pandemic cancellations, guest refund abuse, lack of landlord support) have compounded into generalized hostility toward all booking platforms. Kahneman describes availability cascades as self-reinforcing cycles where initial concern leads to more coverage, which leads to more concern. For Tammy, each new negative Airbnb story she hears or experiences reinforces the cascade. When she encounters Split Lease, her System 1 automatically categorizes it in the 'booking platform' category, which is poisoned by the Airbnb cascade. The platform currently has no mechanism to preemptively break this cascade by signaling that it belongs to a different category entirely.",
      "solution": "Design explicit differentiation signals that categorize Split Lease outside the 'Airbnb-type platform' category in the host's associative memory. This requires: (1) Lead with what Airbnb does wrong and how Split Lease does the opposite. Tammy identified specific failure modes: cancellation policy overrides, guest-favorable refund policies, excessive control over damage claims. The platform should explicitly state its position on each: 'You set your cancellation policy. We don't override it.' (2) Use VRBO's hands-off model as a positive anchor — Tammy already likes VRBO because it lets hosts control policy. Position Split Lease as 'VRBO-like host control plus guaranteed income.' (3) Never use Airbnb-associated UI patterns, terminology, or visual language. If it looks like Airbnb, System 1 categorizes it as Airbnb. (4) Surface the host's policy control as the first interaction: 'Set your minimum monthly income. Set your guest requirements. Set your cancellation terms.'

Additionally, Tammy expects the platform to do the setup work ('I can give you an envelope and you've got create the stage' at 05:47).
