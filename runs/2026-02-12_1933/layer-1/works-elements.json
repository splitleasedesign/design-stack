      "problem": "Guests make escalating commitments (bid submission, call participation, providing detailed requirements) but receive diminishing tangible value in return. The Zella call demonstrates this asymmetry: she provided location details (CCNY area, 125th-145th St, St. Nicholas Park proximity), schedule requirements (Wednesday-Saturday), timeline (7/20 check-in), and budget information, but received zero concrete listings, no confirmed availability, and only a vague promise that matching would take 'a couple of weeks.' Cialdini's commitment research shows that small initial commitments create consistency pressure to continue, but when those commitments aren't reciprocated with equivalent value, the consistency pressure weakens and dropout becomes likely. The guest invested call time and information but left empty-handed.",
      "solution": "Design each commitment step to provide immediate reciprocal value that validates the guest's investment and creates momentum for the next step. (1) Bid placement (discovery phase) should immediately return 3-5 matching properties with photos and pricing, not just acknowledgment. (2) Providing location details (search phase) should trigger real-time map visualization showing available properties in that area, not a promise to 'do homework.' (3) Sharing schedule requirements should display price estimates for that pattern ('Most Wednesday-Saturday guests in your area pay $90-120/night'), providing social proof validation. (4) Each piece of information the guest provides should unlock a piece of information they receive, maintaining equal exchange. The pattern is: guest commits → platform reciprocates → guest commits further → platform reciprocates more. This builds a trust ladder where each step is validated before climbing to the next.",

          "insight": "The agent acknowledges the guest's prior commitment (bid) to create consistency pressure, but provides nothing concrete in return.

Further purchases, even much larger ones, are expected to flow naturally from the commitment.",
          "insight": "The bid is the 'small sale' that creates initial commitment. But unlike the successful sales pattern Cialdini describes, Split Lease doesn't follow through with the 'further purchases.' The guest makes the small commitment but doesn't receive the progression to larger value that would justify escalating investment."

      "problem": "Zella's call contains zero social proof across all journey phases. Not once does the agent reference: other guests with similar needs, successful matches in the CCNY area, typical pricing for Wednesday-Saturday schedules, reviews of properties or hosts, testimonials from current split-lease residents, or any evidence that others have successfully completed this journey. The guest navigates entirely on trust in the agent. Cialdini's research shows that uncertainty is the condition under which social proof becomes most powerful—people rely on others' actions to validate decisions when they're unsure. The split-lease model is inherently uncertain (novel housing arrangement, complex matching, unfamiliar platform), making this the EXACT context where social proof is essential. Its complete absence creates a critical gap, especially when combined with complexity revelations (multi-week matching timeline, dual approval requirement with co-tenant, landlord economics affecting pricing) that increase uncertainty without providing confidence-building evidence.",
      "solution": "Embed social proof at every point where the guest faces uncertainty about whether to continue, what to expect, or what constitutes normal/successful behavior. (1) Discovery phase: 'Join 1,200+ professionals who found flexible housing in NYC through Split Lease' + real guest photos/names/stories. (2) Search phase: Show how many guests searched in this area this month, what price ranges they accepted, how quickly they found matches. 'Most Wednesday-Saturday guests in your area find housing within 5-7 days.' (3) Listing evaluation: Display reviews from prior guests who stayed in this property + host response rate + acceptance rate for proposals on similar properties. (4) Proposal creation: 'Guests who included a personal message received responses 40% faster' + example successful proposals from similar guests. (5) Negotiation: Show typical price negotiation ranges for this property type/area. 'Similar guests settled at $95-110/night.' (6) Acceptance: Testimonials from guests who successfully matched with co-tenants, especially highlighting initial concerns and how they were resolved. (7) Move-in: Videos/photos of other guests' first day, what to expect, what to bring. (8) Active lease: Community forum where current split-lease residents share tips, coordinate with co-tenants, troubleshoot issues.

But as the dropped-wallet experiment showed, we are most influenced in this fashion by the actions of others like us.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_creation", "negotiation", "acceptance"],
      "problem": "Zella's call ends with the agent promising 'I'll be in touch' and the guest waiting passively for contact. This creates a commitment decay window where the guest has no active role and her investment in the process dissipates over time. The agent says matching will take 'a couple of weeks,' during which the guest will likely pursue parallel housing options (traditional rentals, other platforms), reducing exclusive commitment to Split Lease. Cialdini's research shows that active commitments (writing, signing, choosing) are far more powerful than passive agreement. Throughout the call, the guest answered questions and provided information—passive activities that don't create strong commitment. She never took an active step like browsing available listings, creating a proposal, or setting search preferences on the platform. The only active step was the initial bid, which is now days in the past. The call should end with a clear active next step for the guest to maintain commitment momentum, but instead it creates a passive waiting period.",
      "solution": "Convert passive waiting into active participation at every phase where the guest might otherwise disengage. (1) End discovery phase with active step: 'Create your search profile' where the guest sets location, dates, budget as interactive map exploration, not information provision to an agent. (2) Search phase: Guest actively browses listings with filters they control, favoriting properties, comparing options—continuous active engagement rather than waiting for agent to show options. (3) Listing evaluation: Guest actively creates a proposal with personalized message, schedule selection, price offer—this is a written commitment that Cialdini's research shows creates strong consistency pressure. (4) Negotiation: If host counters, guest actively responds (accept, counter-counter, decline with feedback) rather than waiting for agent to negotiate. (5) Acceptance: Guest actively confirms move-in logistics, adds move-in date to calendar, uploads ID for verification. The pattern is: never leave the guest waiting. Every phase transition should require an active step from the guest, even if small. This maintains commitment momentum and prevents the decay that occurs during passive waiting periods.",

      "problem": "Zella placed a bid on the website and registered on the platform, yet during the call she confuses 'Split Lease' with 'Straight Lease' (5:01-5:11) and needs the core concept explained from scratch. The agent must explain that Split Lease matches two people with complementary schedules (4:11-4:44), a fundamental concept that should have been clear before she submitted a bid. This reveals that the discovery phase failed to establish basic platform understanding. She could complete visible actions (registration, bid placement) without comprehending what the platform actually does or how it works. This creates a dangerous pattern: the guest makes early commitments (bid submission) based on incomplete understanding, then faces surprising complexity later (matching requirement, mutual approval, multi-week timeline) that she didn't anticipate. Cialdini's commitment research shows that small commitments create consistency pressure, but if those commitments were made under false assumptions, the consistency pressure weakens when reality becomes clear.",
      "solution": "Require demonstrated platform understanding before allowing consequential commitments. (1) Discovery phase must clearly explain the split-lease model BEFORE allowing bid submission. Use interactive visualization: 'Here's how it works: You need Wednesday-Saturday. We match you with someone who needs Sunday-Tuesday. Together you fill the apartment, split the cost, and never overlap.' Require guest to interact with this explanation (click through steps, watch short video, answer simple comprehension question) before enabling bid submission. (2) Search phase must reinforce understanding with every listing: show the complementary schedule visually on each property card ('You use this apartment Wed-Sat. Your co-tenant uses it Sun-Tue.'). (3) Before proposal creation, require acknowledgment of key commitments: 'I understand I'll be matched with a co-tenant, we'll both need to approve each other, and matching typically takes 5-7 days.' This checkbox isn't legal CYA—it's commitment reinforcement through active acknowledgment. (4) Use consistent terminology everywhere. If the platform calls it 'split lease' in one place, 'shared tenancy' in another, and 'periodic rental' in a third, guests will be confused. Pick one term and use it religiously. The pattern is: comprehension gates commitment. Don't accept commitments from confused guests.",
