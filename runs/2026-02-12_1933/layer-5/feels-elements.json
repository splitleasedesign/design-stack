      "problem": "Zella placed a bid without receiving any concrete listings or validation that her needs could be met. The call ended with her providing extensive information but receiving only vague promises. This creates emotional abandonment—guest invests effort but gets no reciprocal emotional payoff. The emotional challenge is: 'Am I wasting my time here, or will this actually work for me?' Without immediate evidence of value, guests feel uncertainty rather than relief.",
      "solution": "Create immediate emotional relief through visible reciprocal value. The moment a guest provides location, they should FEEL their search taking shape through real-time visual feedback. When Zella says 'CCNY area,' she should instantly SEE properties on a map near CCNY. The emotional shift is from 'I'm filling out another form' to 'Oh! This is actually finding me places.' Every input should trigger an emotional micro-reward through instant, visible results. The copy voice should celebrate discovery: 'Here are 5 places near CCNY that match your schedule' not 'We'll look for options.' Make the guest feel found, not searching.",
