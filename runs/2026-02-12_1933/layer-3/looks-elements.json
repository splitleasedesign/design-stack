Visual hierarchy should show the guest what they're getting in exchange for what they're giving.",

When guest provides location, immediately render map with matching properties. When guest sets schedule (Wed-Sat), show calendar visualization with their days highlighted and co-tenant days in complementary visual treatment. When guest sets budget, show price distribution graph with their range highlighted and similar guests' actual prices as data points. Use color to distinguish guest input (accent green) from platform response (warm neutrals with accent touches), creating clear visual exchange.",

Split Lease shows two person icons + split calendar (guest days in accent, co-tenant days in surface-warm) + lower price tag. Keep visual extremely simple (3 comparison points max) and use generous spacing (xl) to avoid overwhelm. Positioning: discovery phase hero section, before any commitment actions.",
