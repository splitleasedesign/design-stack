      "problem": "Experienced hosts carry non-standard rules they have developed from painful past experiences -- utility caps with conditional thresholds, personal vetting requirements beyond platform defaults, cross-platform calendar blocking obligations. These rules are invisible to the platform unless the host explicitly states them during a call. The platform has no structured way to capture, confirm, or enforce conditional rules like a $40 utility cap with guest-paid overage. When these rules are not visibly encoded, the host cannot verify the platform is protecting them, and trust erodes silently. June asked about the same fee rule twice in one call because the verbal feedback did not persist, demonstrating that one-time explanations fail for critical rules.",
      "solution": "Design every host-defined rule as a structured microinteraction with three components: (1) A capture mechanism that accepts conditional logic, not just binary toggles. The utility cap needs a threshold field ($40), an owner-responsibility indicator, and an overage-assignment field, not just 'utilities included: yes/no'. (2) Immediate confirmation feedback that mirrors the host's own language. After the host enters '$40 cap, guest pays overage,' the platform displays 'You cover the first $40 of electric. Your guest pays anything above that.' (3) Persistent visibility: every rule the host defined must remain visible on the listing, the proposal, and the active lease dashboard. Critical rules should appear as persistent indicators, not one-time confirmation toasts. Saffer's principle applies: feedback illuminates the rules, and rules that are not illuminated do not exist from the user's perspective.",

          "insight": "The utility cap is not a preference -- it is a learned protection mechanism born from repeated painful experiences. The platform must treat this as a non-negotiable rule with enforcement, not as an optional data field."

Onboarding was promised as 'I'll create the listings and send you a link.' June's recognized trigger for every interaction is Bryant, not the platform. When the platform introduces its own triggers (email notifications, dashboard alerts, login screens), it breaks the trigger consistency that Saffer identifies as essential: 'Have the trigger initiate the same action every time. This is so users can create an accurate mental model of how the microinteraction works.' June's mental model is 'I text Bryant and things happen.' The platform's model is 'log in, navigate, and do things yourself.' This mismatch creates a trust gap at the human-to-digital handoff -- the highest-risk transition in the host journey.",

(1) The first email from the platform should come from Bryant's name and include his photo, not from 'noreply@splitlease.com.' (2) The first screen the host sees should show Bryant's name, the properties discussed, and the terms confirmed during the call. The platform should feel like opening notes from someone you just talked to. (3) The listing review screen should be framed as 'Bryant created this listing from your Furnished Finder info. Review and confirm.' not 'Create your listing.' (4) The platform should preserve the agent as a visible, contactable presence on every screen during the first lease cycle. The agent trigger that the host already trusts must transfer to the platform, not be replaced by it. Over time, as the host builds direct trust with the platform through successful transactions, the agent presence can become more ambient.",

The platform currently treats its own boundaries as the edges of the host's world.

(1) During proposal acceptance, show the host a checklist or reminder of what needs to happen on other platforms: 'You mentioned you have this listed on Furnished Finder.

(2) Long-term: explore calendar sync integrations with major platforms (Furnished Finder, Airbnb iCal) so that accepting a booking on Split Lease automatically blocks the dates elsewhere. (3) During listing creation, import data from existing platform listings rather than requiring re-entry. If the host shares a Furnished Finder link, scrape or import the pricing, photos, and description. (4) Frame multi-platform management as a feature, not a problem.

Her $40 cap is a protective rule, but the platform has no mechanism to monitor, report, or enforce it during the lease. Saffer identifies that recurring microinteractions (long loops) must evolve over time: 'What happens over time with the microinteraction?' A utility monitoring loop that stays static for 3+ months will either become noise (if the guest complies) or miss escalation signals (if the guest exceeds the cap repeatedly). Additionally, June mentions a roommate replacement scenario that is a mode shift within the active lease -- from stable occupancy to replacement -- requiring its own trigger, rules, and feedback structure.",

(1) Utility monitoring should provide a monthly summary visible to the host showing actual usage vs. the cap threshold. If the guest stays under the cap for consecutive months, the feedback becomes more ambient (a green indicator). If they exceed it, the feedback escalates (alert with overage amount and automatic guest notification). (2) Payment confirmation should arrive as a persistent, recurring signal each payment cycle -- not just the absence of a problem, but positive confirmation: 'Payment of $2,690 received and deposited for February.' This is especially critical for the payment guarantee promise. (3) The long loop should get quieter over time for compliant leases (reducing notification frequency) and louder for problematic ones (increasing alert urgency).

      "problem": "June's proposal evaluation requires verifying multiple conditions simultaneously: guest vetting status, pricing accuracy, utility cap inclusion, calendar impact on other platforms, and lease duration acceptability. In the call, these were addressed sequentially over several minutes of conversation with Bryant. On the platform, if these verification points are spread across multiple screens or require clicking into sub-sections, the host cannot perform the holistic assessment that proposals demand. Saffer's principle that 'Feedback Illuminates the Rules' means every rule the host cares about must be visible at the moment of decision. June said 'I need to know who they are and what type of people' and 'tell them it's something they have to decide quickly' -- she needs speed AND thoroughness, which are only compatible if all information is on one surface.",
      "solution": "Design the proposal review screen as a single-surface verification checklist that displays every host-defined rule alongside its current status. (1) Guest vetting: show a summary card with employment status, vetting completion indicator, and link to full profile. Do not force the host to navigate to a separate vetting page. (2) Pricing accuracy: display the exact rent, deposit, cleaning fee, and any conditional rules (utility cap) as the host defined them, with a visual confirmation that these match the host's listing. (3) Calendar impact: show the proposed dates and flag which other platforms need to be blocked. (4) Lease terms: show duration, extension option, and start date in the host's original language. (5) Payment guarantee: show the guarantee as a visible, branded element -- not fine print. (6) A single 'Accept' action after visual verification, not a multi-step approval wizard. The proposal screen is a decision surface, and all inputs to that decision must be present on it.",
