      "problem": "June is personally depleted ('I been going through a lot of stuff myself,' 06:33), time-constrained ('I got a couple of zoom calls today,' 00:19), and has never seen the Split Lease platform. Her only relationship is with Bryant, who promised to handle everything and send her a link. If her first platform encounter feels like a stranger asking for something -- account creation, form-filling, orientation -- her emotional state shifts from the relieved delegation she felt at the end of the call to the anxiety of facing an unfamiliar system alone. The emotional risk is that the platform's first impression erases the warmth Bryant established and replaces it with the cold feeling of 'another thing I have to figure out.'",
      "solution": "The first platform touchpoint must produce instant recognition: 'This is from Bryant. He did what he said he would do. My information is already here.' The emotional principle is recognition before demand -- the host must feel known before being asked to do anything. Every visual element on the entry screen (Bryant's name, property address, pricing in the host's stated numbers) should trigger the feeling of opening a note from someone who listened, not arriving at a product that wants something from you. The copy, layout, and animation must all serve the same emotional beat: you are in the right place, we heard you, here is what we prepared.",

They are protection mechanisms born from painful experiences: '$100, $200 bills... heat is on while the windows are open... I had to start protecting myself' (04:26-04:51). She also explicitly rejects unknown tenants: 'I don't want Connie in the house' (06:04). When a platform records these rules but provides no visible evidence of enforcement, the host is left in a state of anxious vigilance: 'Did they capture my rule? Is it actually being applied? Am I protected?' The emotional failure is that the platform asks the host to trust without showing proof, which contradicts the entire reason the host created these rules -- because past trust was violated.",
      "solution": "Every protection rule must produce visible confirmation at every phase of its lifecycle: captured during listing creation, applied during proposal review, enforced during the active lease. The emotional principle is that protection rules are not data fields -- they are promises the platform makes to the host. Each phase must provide evidence that the promise is being kept. The copy, visual treatment, and interaction patterns must all communicate 'we are actively protecting you' rather than 'we recorded your preference.' The host should feel a steady accumulation of confidence that her boundaries are respected, building from 'I told them my rule' to 'I can see my rule on the listing' to 'I can see my rule was applied to this guest' to 'I can see my rule was enforced this month.'",

      "problem": "Bryant verbally promised June a payment guarantee: 'Even in the case that a guest missed a payment or didn't pay, you still get paid' (02:53-03:25). During a 3+ month lease, this verbal promise must be converted into recurring evidence that the guarantee is real. The emotional danger of silence-as-positive-feedback is that hosts who have been burned before (and June has been) do not interpret silence as 'everything is fine.' They interpret it as 'I don't know what's happening, and last time I didn't know what was happening, I got a $200 electric bill.' Saffer's long loop principle (Ch. 5, p. 117) requires that recurring microinteractions evolve over time. Emotionally, this means the platform must build trust through repeated proof in the early months, then gracefully reduce frequency as trust is established.",
      "solution": "Every payment cycle, the host receives active positive confirmation: 'Payment of $2,690 deposited for February.' Every utility cycle, the host sees the current usage relative to her cap. These are not alert-only signals -- they fire in the positive case too. The emotional principle is that trust is built through repeated evidence, not through the absence of problems. Early in the lease (months 1-2), confirmations are frequent and detailed. As the lease matures without issues (months 3+), confirmations become more ambient -- a green indicator rather than a push notification -- but they never disappear entirely.

The emotional consequence is recurring uncertainty: even when the host was told the answer, she cannot recall whether she remembered correctly. This micro-uncertainty compounds across multiple rules (rent, deposit, cleaning fee, utility cap, no-fees-to-host) and across multiple journey phases.

She describes $100-$200 bills, heat running with windows open, and having to 'start protecting myself' (04:26-04:51). This vigilance is emotionally exhausting and is one of the hidden costs of being a landlord. If the platform provides a dashboard that requires active monitoring -- checking in regularly, interpreting raw data, calculating whether the guest is under the cap -- it simply transfers the monitoring burden from analog (checking the electric meter) to digital (checking the dashboard). The emotional promise of the platform should be 'we monitor so you don't have to,' but this only works if the ambient feedback is trustworthy enough that the host actually lets go of her vigilance rather than adding platform-checking to her existing monitoring routine.",
      "solution": "The emotional principle is vigilance offloading: the platform earns the right to carry the host's monitoring burden by proving, over multiple cycles, that it catches what the host would catch. The ambient-to-alert color system (L3 looks-004, L4 behaves-004) is the mechanism; the emotional design is about the progressive release of vigilance over time. In month 1, the host will check the dashboard frequently -- and it should be ready for her, showing green indicators with specific numbers. In month 2, if the guest is compliant, the host checks less often -- and the platform matches this by reducing push notification frequency to monthly summaries. By month 3, if all is well, the host trusts the platform to alert her only when something needs attention. The emotional arc is from 'I need to check' to 'I trust they will tell me.' This arc cannot be forced; it must be earned through consistent, accurate feedback over multiple cycles.",
