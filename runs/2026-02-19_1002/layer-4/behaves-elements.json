      "problem": "Bryant promises June he will create her listing and send it for review (13:27). The human-to-digital handoff is the highest-risk transition: June expects a finished product to scan and confirm, not a blank form to fill. If the platform loads slowly, shows an empty state, or requires multi-step account creation before revealing the listing Bryant prepared, June -- who is personally depleted (06:33) and time-constrained (00:19) -- will close the tab. The interaction must feel instant and pre-populated from the first millisecond, matching the 'Don't Start from Zero' principle (Saffer Ch. 3, p. 64). But pre-populated data from a phone call may contain transcription errors (Bryant manually entered $2,690 rent, $2,500 deposit, $140 cleaning fee from a noisy phone conversation). The interaction must handle both the happy path (data is correct, host confirms) and the error path (data is wrong, host corrects) without breaking the flow.",
      "solution": "Display the agent-created listing optimistically: show all pre-populated data immediately on page load with no loading spinner. Each field appears in its confirmed visual state (mono numerics on accent-light background per L3 looks-001). The host scans and either confirms or taps a field to edit. Editing a field triggers an inline correction microinteraction: the field expands to an editable input, the host changes the value, and the field collapses back to its confirmed visual state with a brief checkmark animation. If the host makes no changes, a single 'Confirm Listing' button saves the listing as-is. If the host edits a field, the button text changes to 'Save Changes and Confirm' to acknowledge the correction. The entire interaction assumes the data is correct (optimistic) and only shifts to correction mode when the host initiates it (rollback on mismatch). No loading state is shown for the initial display because the data was pre-entered by Bryant and is already available server-side before the host clicks the link.",

      "problem": "June asked the identical fee question twice in one call (07:32 and 10:59), proving that one-time feedback does not persist even within a single conversation. On the platform, host-defined rules (utility cap: $40, deposit: $2,500, cleaning fee: $140, rent: $2,690) are entered during listing creation but must remain visible and verifiable at every subsequent decision point. The interaction challenge is: how does the rule verification strip (L2 communicates-001, L3 looks-001) behave when the host navigates between screens? If it animates in fresh each time, the host must re-scan and re-verify. If it disappears during transitions, the host experiences a micro-anxiety: 'Are my rules still there?' Saffer's feedback principle (Ch. 4, p. 86) states that rules the user cannot see are rules they do not trust. The interaction pattern must make rules feel permanently present, not repeatedly re-introduced.",
      "solution": "The rule verification strip is a fixed UI element that persists across screen transitions without re-rendering or re-animating. When the host navigates from the listing editor to the proposal screen to the lease dashboard, the strip remains visually stable -- it does not fade out and fade in. On screens where the strip is relevant (listing editor, proposal review, lease dashboard), it occupies the same spatial position (top of the content area, below any header). On screens where it is not relevant (settings, account profile), it collapses with a 200ms slide-up animation and re-expands when the host returns to a rule-relevant screen. The key behavioral principle: rules that are always visible do not need to be re-verified. The strip's values update in real-time only when the host edits them (during listing editing) or when a threshold is crossed (during active lease monitoring). All other times, the strip is static and inert -- it is reference information, not interactive content.",

In the phone call, these verifications happened sequentially over several minutes. The platform must collapse this linear verification into a parallel, single-surface experience. The interaction challenge is that showing all verification data simultaneously risks overwhelming the host, while hiding any of it behind tabs or links risks the host missing critical information.

I had to start protecting myself' (04:26-04:51). She set a $40 utility cap as a learned protection mechanism. During a 3+ month lease, the platform must provide continuous confirmation that this rule is enforced without creating alert fatigue. Saffer's Long Loop principle (Ch. 5, p. 117) requires recurring microinteractions to evolve over time. A static dashboard that shows the same level of detail in month 1 and month 4 either overwhelms the compliant case or under-serves the problematic case.

The ambient mode gets quieter over time: in the first month, a push notification accompanies each payment and utility update; by the third month of compliance, notifications reduce to monthly summaries only, and the dashboard indicators remain green but do not trigger push alerts. In alert mode (a threshold is crossed), the affected row transitions from green to amber (200ms color shift, easing-out). The row expands to show the specific issue: 'Utility usage: $52 / $40 cap. Guest has been notified of $12 overage.' A push notification fires immediately. If the issue escalates (utility exceeds cap by 50%+ or payment is late), the color shifts to signal-danger. Alert mode is spring-loaded per Saffer Ch. 5 (p. 111-113): it activates on threshold breach and deactivates when the issue resolves, returning the row to ambient green.",
