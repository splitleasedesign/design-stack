Through the Microinteractions lens, the initial outreach is a system-initiated trigger (Saffer, Ch. 2, p. 43-46): the platform detected a matching listing and created the conditions for contact. But the trigger's feedback was insufficient -- June did not even have her email connected to Furnished Finder (june-call.txt, 03:41-03:46: 'you're going to Furnished Finder, is going to my email... I don't think it gave an email'), meaning the system trigger failed to reach her directly.

Saffer's principle that 'the trigger should initiate the same action every time' (Ch. 2, p. 26) is at risk because June's mental model of the trigger is 'I text Bryant and he handles it.' If the platform introduces different triggers (email notifications, dashboard alerts, login requirements), the consistency is broken.

She explicitly states that guests 'have to decide quickly because I would have to block it on the different platforms I have it on' (05:40-05:52). Through the Microinteractions lens, the proposal is a time-sensitive trigger (Saffer Ch. 2): it initiates a sequence of actions that extends beyond the platform (blocking calendars on Furnished Finder, other sites). The rules of the proposal microinteraction (Saffer Ch. 3) must therefore include the cross-platform blocking consequence as a visible part of the flow. June also needs clear feedback (Saffer Ch. 4) at two levels: (1) confirmation that the guest has been vetted to her standards ('I need to know who they are,' 06:04), and (2) confirmation that the terms match what she stated (accurate rent, deposit, cleaning fee, utility rules). The proposal is not just an accept/decline action -- it is a multi-rule verification that the host performs before committing. Saffer's concept of 'Feedback Illuminates the Rules' (Ch. 4, p. 86) is critical: every rule June cares about (vetting, pricing accuracy, calendar impact) must be surfaced as feedback within the proposal view.",

They're not home, running, you know, all of that stuff'). Through the Microinteractions lens, the utility cap is a loop (Saffer Ch. 5, p. 109-121): a recurring microinteraction that repeats each billing cycle. The loop has a rule (first $40 covered by host, overage by guest), feedback requirements (monthly utility reporting visible to both parties), and a potential mode shift (if the guest consistently exceeds the cap, what happens?). Saffer's concept of 'Long Loops' (Ch. 5, p. 117) applies: over the course of a 3+ month lease, the utility monitoring microinteraction needs to evolve -- perhaps becoming less prominent if the guest stays within bounds, or escalating alerts if they consistently exceed the cap. June also mentions a roommate replacement scenario (12:29-12:40: 'they basically found a new roommate and they just stayed'), indicating that the active lease phase includes guest turnover events that need their own microinteraction structure (triggers for replacement notification, rules for lease modification, feedback confirming continuity).",

Through the Microinteractions lens, retention is about the long loop (Saffer Ch. 5, p. 117): how does the microinteraction change after the first cycle? June's willingness to expand her engagement is a signal that the platform's long loop should evolve from single-property/single-lease to multi-property/multi-lease management. The retention microinteraction should also address the extension scenario: guests who start with 3 months and extend (05:09-05:40: 'start with three months... and then there's the option to extend'). Saffer's principle that microinteractions should 'not start from zero' (Ch. 3, p. 64) is critical for retention: the second listing, the second lease, the extension of an existing lease should all build on what the platform already knows, not restart the process.",
