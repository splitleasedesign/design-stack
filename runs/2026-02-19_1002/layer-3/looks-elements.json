      "problem": "June asked the identical fee question twice in one call (07:32 and 10:59), proving verbal feedback does not persist. When host-defined rules (rent, deposit, cleaning fee, utility cap) appear only during data entry and then vanish into stored fields, the host cannot verify them at decision points. The L2 element communicates-001 architects a rule verification strip; the visual challenge is making that strip scannable in under 2 seconds across every context where it appears, without competing with primary content or blending into surrounding UI. Saffer's feedback principle (Ch. 4, p. 86) states that rules the user cannot see are rules the user does not trust. The visual pattern must make numeric rules -- the host's most concrete mental anchors -- instantly recognizable through consistent typographic treatment.",
      "solution": "Display all host-defined numeric rules (rent, deposit, cleaning fee, utility cap) in IBM Plex Mono at a slightly larger weight than surrounding body text, set against the accent-light background token. The mono typeface creates a visual signature that signals 'this is your verified data' wherever it appears -- on listing editors, proposal screens, and lease dashboards. Each rule occupies a single horizontal line: a label in Outfit regular (ink-soft color) followed by the numeric value in IBM Plex Mono semibold (ink color). The strip sits in a container with the accent-light background, a 1px border using the border token, and radius-sm corners. The consistent visual treatment means the host's eye learns to locate their rules by typeface alone, even on unfamiliar screens.",

Both badges appear inline on the proposal screen -- not as tooltips, not as expandable sections. They are always visible where the host makes accept/decline decisions.

During the active lease, she needs continuous confirmation that her $40 utility cap is being enforced. But static dashboards create two failure modes: if the design is always high-alert, the host habituates and stops scanning; if the design is always ambient, the host misses genuine problems. Saffer's Long Loop principle (Ch. 5, p. 117) requires that recurring microinteractions adapt over time.

Payment status appears as a single line with a green checkmark icon. The overall visual temperature is calm: greens and warm neutrals. In alert mode (a threshold is crossed), the affected indicator switches to signal-warn-bg background with signal-warn color for the progress bar fill and text. If the situation is critical (payment missed, significant overage), it escalates to signal-danger-bg with signal-danger color. The transition between modes uses the easing-out token for a smooth 300ms color change, not an abrupt swap.

The L2 element communicates-006 architects a two-tier information structure (building profile vs. unit profile). The visual challenge is making the distinction between inherited building-level data and editable unit-level data immediately obvious without requiring the host to read instructions. If both tiers look the same, the host will attempt to edit building data she already confirmed, wasting time. If the building tier is invisible, the host will worry that shared rules (utility cap, deposit) are missing from the second listing. The visual pattern must express 'this is confirmed and shared' vs. 'this is new and yours to fill in' through visual treatment alone.",
      "solution": "Render the building profile as a summary banner at the top of the second listing screen using bg-deep background, with values in IBM Plex Mono at ink-muted color and labels in Outfit at ink-ghost color. The muted color treatment signals 'confirmed, not editable here.' An 'Edit building info' link in accent color provides the escape hatch but is visually secondary. Below the banner, a visual divider (1px border-strong line with lg spacing above and below) separates the building tier from the unit tier. The unit profile section uses the standard surface background with full-color ink text and editable form fields. The visual contrast between the two tiers is stark: muted/dim above the divider, full-saturation/interactive below it. This pattern scales to three, four, or more units: the building banner remains constant; only the unit section changes. The principle: visual saturation signals editability; visual desaturation signals confirmation.",

The visual system must distinguish between ordinary listing data (bedroom count, location description) and protection-driven rules that the host has established to prevent past harms from recurring. If a protection rule receives the same visual treatment as a standard data field, the host cannot confirm at a glance that the platform is protecting her. The visual pattern must create a distinct 'protected' state that communicates: this rule exists because you asked for it, and we are enforcing it.",

Use a left-edge accent border (3px solid accent color on the left side of the container) with accent-light background. Inside the container, the rule is displayed in the standard mono numeric format from looks-001, but the left border creates a visual 'flag' that distinguishes this rule from ordinary listing data. On the listing editor, the protection container appears beside the relevant field (utility cap, vetting preference, deposit). On the proposal screen, protection rules appear in the terms zone with the same left-border treatment, confirming they are captured in the proposal. On the active lease dashboard, the utility usage indicator inherits the left-border accent when in ambient mode, creating visual continuity: the same accent-green flag that marked the rule during creation now marks its enforcement during the lease.
