      "problem": "June carries non-standard, protection-driven rules (utility cap at $40 with guest-paid overage, vetting documentation requirements, deposit and cleaning fee amounts) that she needs to verify are accurately captured at every phase. In the call, she asked the identical fee question twice (07:32 and 10:59), demonstrating that verbal feedback does not persist in memory. When critical rules are communicated once and then disappear -- as a toast notification, a confirmation email, or a spoken promise -- the host cannot verify them at the moment of decision. This forces the host to re-ask, re-check, or lose trust silently. The information architecture problem is that host-defined rules are treated as input data (captured once, stored invisibly) rather than as persistent reference information (always visible where relevant).",
      "solution": "Architect a persistent 'Rule Verification Strip' -- a fixed, scannable summary of all host-defined rules -- that appears on every screen where those rules are actionable. On the listing editor, this strip shows rent ($2,690), deposit ($2,500), cleaning fee ($140), utility cap ($40 / guest pays overage) as always-visible fields, not as collapsed sections. On the proposal review screen, the same strip appears with verification indicators (checkmarks or match/mismatch flags) confirming that the proposal terms align with the host's stated rules. On the active lease dashboard, the strip persists as a reference panel showing which rules are currently in effect. The strip uses the host's own language, not platform terminology. The architecture principle: host-defined rules are reference information, not input data, and reference information must be persistently visible at every decision point.",

In the call, these were addressed sequentially over several minutes because phone conversations are linear. But a digital proposal screen does not need to be linear. The information architecture risk is that the proposal screen fragments these verification points across multiple tabs, modals, or sub-pages, forcing the host into a sequential hunt for information that should be available in parallel. June said 'I need to know who they are and what type of people' (06:04) and 'tell them it's something they have to decide quickly' (05:40) -- she needs speed AND thoroughness, which are only compatible when all decision inputs are on one surface.",

This is not a separate page; it is an inline card. (2) Terms Zone -- the host's rules from their listing displayed alongside the proposed terms, with match indicators. Rent: $2,690 (matches listing). Duration: 3 months (with extension option). Start date: March 2nd. Utility cap: $40 / guest pays overage (confirmed). (3) Action Zone -- calendar impact notice ('Block these dates on your other platforms: Furnished Finder, [other]'), payment guarantee badge, and a single Accept / Decline action pair.

The information architecture challenge is that the platform's entry screen is designed generically -- for any host arriving from any channel -- rather than specifically for a host who has just completed a call with a named agent about specific properties. June is personally depleted ('going through a lot of stuff myself,' 06:33) and time-constrained ('a couple of zoom calls today,' 00:19).

      "problem": "June operates on Furnished Finder, other unnamed platforms, and potentially Split Lease. Every commitment on Split Lease (accepting a proposal, extending a lease) has an invisible external cost: manual calendar blocking on other platforms. June states this explicitly: 'Tell them it's something they have to decide quickly because I would have to block it on the different platforms I have it on' (05:40). The information architecture problem is that the platform's commitment flows (proposal acceptance, lease extension) treat the commitment as a closed-system action -- 'Accept this proposal' -- without acknowledging or surfacing the cross-platform consequences. The host is left to remember, on her own, that accepting on Split Lease means she needs to go block dates on Furnished Finder and elsewhere. This hidden cost creates anxiety at the decision point and risk of double-booking after it.",
      "solution": "At every commitment point, insert a cross-platform impact disclosure panel immediately before the action button. This panel reads: 'When you accept, remember to block [dates] on your other platforms.' If the host has previously indicated which platforms she uses (captured during onboarding or listing creation), the panel names them specifically: 'Block March 2 - June 2 on Furnished Finder.' The panel is not a blocker -- it does not require the host to confirm she has blocked -- but it is architecturally positioned as the last thing the host sees before pressing Accept, making it impossible to miss. For lease extensions, the same pattern applies: 'Your lease is extending to September 2. Update your availability on Furnished Finder.' Long-term, this panel becomes the integration point for calendar sync automation.",

Her $40 cap is a rule she needs continuously verified throughout the lease, not just at listing creation. But the information architecture challenge extends beyond utilities: the active lease requires ongoing confirmation of payment receipt, rule enforcement, and lease status. If the platform provides no active-lease information architecture, the host must either (a) monitor manually, recreating the anxiety the platform was supposed to eliminate, or (b) trust blindly, which contradicts the protection-driven mindset June has developed from negative experiences.

This ambient mode requires zero interaction -- the host glances and is reassured. In alert mode, triggered when a threshold is crossed (utility exceeds $40, payment is delayed, lease end is approaching), the dashboard surfaces specific information: the overage amount, the action the platform is taking (guest notification, overage charge), and what the host needs to do (if anything).

      "problem": "June owns a three-family house with at least two listable apartments and proactively offered to list both (09:36). Multi-unit hosts face an information architecture problem: rules, pricing defaults, and property details exist at two levels -- the building level (address, house rules, utility policy, neighborhood description) and the unit level (floor, bedrooms, specific rent, unit photos). If the information architecture treats each listing as an independent entity, the host must re-enter building-level information for every unit. This violates Saffer's Don't Start from Zero principle and creates inconsistency risk (different utility cap phrasing across units, slightly different addresses). The L1 element works-004 identifies this as a process problem; the information architecture challenge is how to structure the screens so the host sees and edits building-level data once and unit-level data per unit.",
      "solution": "Architect listing creation as a two-tier information structure. The first tier is the Building Profile: address, neighborhood description, transit access (June mentioned '3/2/9 express downtown'), house rules, utility policy, and deposit amount. This is entered once and shared across all units. The second tier is the Unit Profile: unit identifier (Apt 1, Apt 2), bedrooms, rent amount, unit-specific photos, and any unit-specific overrides to building-level defaults. When the host creates a second listing, the screen shows the Building Profile as pre-filled and read-only (with an 'Edit building info' link), and presents only the Unit Profile fields for input. The scan pattern is: building info (confirmed) above a divider line, unit info (editable) below. This architecture makes it visually clear what is shared and what is unique.",

The building profile is visually distinguished from the unit profile through background color or section framing, making the two-tier structure immediately apparent.",

It is expandable for editing but defaults to showing just key values (address, utility policy, deposit) in a compact format. Unit-level data is fully disclosed as editable fields.
