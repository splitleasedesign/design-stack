      "problem": "Diane's cognitive ease was built by Robert's conversational warmth and concrete language during a 17-minute call. When she transitions to the website to verify claims ('I want to read the whole website,' 15:59), she moves from a warm human interaction to a cold digital surface. Kahneman shows that cognitive ease is associated with 'good mood, like what you see, believe what you hear, trust your intuitions,' while strain triggers 'vigilance and suspicion.' If the website's tone is corporate, formal, or unfamiliar, the strain-vigilance-suspicion cluster activates at the exact moment the host is deciding whether to proceed. The emotional challenge is not information delivery -- it is mood preservation across a medium change.",
      "solution": "The website's first viewport must produce the emotional sensation of recognition -- the host sees words she has already heard and feels the warmth of a conversation she already had. Use the exact conversational phrases from the call script as headlines. Keep the tone direct, personal, and plain. The emotional goal is not excitement or delight; it is the quiet comfort of familiarity. The host should feel: 'I know this. This is what Robert told me.' That feeling of recognition is the emotional bridge between the warm call and the cold screen.",

She is not a novice discovering hosting -- she is a domain expert evaluating a new tool. When Robert explains pricing, she immediately asserts: 'I just did all of that for years...

If the platform's tone treats her like a beginner who needs education, it creates emotional friction: the host feels condescended to, her expertise is unacknowledged, and the resulting annoyance pushes her toward the vigilance-suspicion cluster. But there is a paradox: her confidence is partly an illusion of familiarity (Kahneman's 'familiarity of one phrase sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar and therefore true'). The emotional challenge is to respect her competence while gently surfacing what is genuinely different.",

The host's System 1 scans every notification and every screen for signals of how much effort is coming. A notification that implies a long process ('Complete your listing setup') triggers aversion before the host reads a single word.
