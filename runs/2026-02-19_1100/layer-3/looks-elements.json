Kahneman's cognitive ease research shows that legibility and visual prominence directly affect truth perception: 'If your message is to be printed, use high-quality paper to maximize the contrast between characters and their background.' If the three core guarantees (payment collection, damage matching, zero host fees) appear in low-contrast secondary text or are buried below the fold, they lose the truth-feeling the call established. The website must make these guarantees the most visually prominent elements on every host-facing page, because visual prominence triggers cognitive ease, and cognitive ease triggers belief.",
      "solution": "Present the three core guarantee statements as the highest-contrast, largest-weight text elements on the host landing page and onboarding welcome screen. Use the serif headline typeface at a large display size with maximum foreground-to-background contrast to produce the fluency that Kahneman links to truth perception. The guarantees should occupy the primary visual hierarchy position -- the element the eye encounters first -- on every host-facing entry page. Body explanations and legal details use the standard sans body treatment at lower visual weight, creating a clear two-tier hierarchy where the call-language headline is always read before the formal elaboration.",

Layer 1 prescribes that every task be completable in under 2 minutes, delivered via deep links to a phone. This means the primary interaction surface is a mobile screen used in the margins of a busy day -- between property visits, during transit, while multitasking. Small tap targets, cramped layouts, and desktop-optimized forms create visual cognitive strain on mobile: the host must squint, precisely tap, and carefully scroll, all of which Kahneman associates with the strain-vigilance-suspicion cluster. For a host who is evaluating whether this platform is worth her scarce time, a mobile interface that feels effortful is a dropout signal.",
      "solution": "Enforce generous tap-target sizing and vertical spacing on all host-facing task screens, with mobile as the primary design target. All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, toggles, card-level tap areas) must meet 48px minimum height with 8px minimum vertical separation between adjacent tap targets. Action buttons on task screens (confirm, approve, edit) should be full-width on mobile, positioned at the bottom of the viewport for thumb-reach ergonomics. Form inputs should use --input-height-lg (48px) by default on mobile, not --input-height (42px). The overall visual density should be lower on mobile than on desktop -- fewer elements per viewport, more breathing room between elements. The visual impression should be: 'I can do this quickly with my thumb' not 'I need to find my reading glasses.'",

Kahneman's mere exposure research shows that repeated exposure to a stimulus builds familiarity, which builds positive feelings, which builds trust. But the platform's visual identity must be the stimulus that is repeated -- the same colors, the same typographic voice, the same spatial rhythm -- at every touchpoint from the agent's email to the landing page to the onboarding screen to the active lease dashboard. If each phase looks like a different product (the email is plain text, the landing page is marketing-heavy, the dashboard is enterprise-utilitarian), no mere-exposure effect accumulates.

(4) The mono typeface (IBM Plex Mono) for any financial figures, present wherever numbers appear. (5) The rounded card pattern (--rounded-xl, 12px) for all content containers. These five anchors form the visual 'word' that is repeated across phases. Each time the host encounters them, mere exposure builds.
