The platform reached her on an external site where she already had listings. Kahneman's mere exposure effect (Ch. 5, 'The Pleasure of Cognitive Ease') explains why this channel works: Diane was already in a context of managing rental listings, so an ad about rentals triggered cognitive ease rather than suspicion. The outreach arrived in a familiar habitat (a rental listing site), matching her existing mental models. However, her extreme busyness ('the day is never long enough,' 00:49) means the discovery moment must require near-zero cognitive effort or she will never follow up. The fact that she did respond suggests the ad was fluent enough to pass her System 1 filter, but the transcript reveals no evidence that the Split Lease brand itself carried any prior familiarity -- all the cognitive ease came from the context (rental ads), not the brand.",

Diane must set different prices for different scenarios (4 nights at $50/night vs. 2 nights at $60/night). This is genuinely complex, and Robert walks through it conversationally. But Kahneman's framework predicts a problem: this pricing explanation produces cognitive ease only because Robert is talking through it in real time, adjusting his examples, and using a conversational register. When Diane encounters the same pricing structure as a form on the website, all that conversational scaffolding disappears. The form must do what Robert did: present pricing as a series of simple, concrete scenarios, not as a multi-variable matrix. Diane's response at 14:20 ('I just did all of that for years...

If Diane's journey from discovery through active lease consistently produces ease, she will associate Split Lease with safety and comfort -- and renewal/re-listing becomes automatic (System 1 driven).
