      "problem": "The sales call builds cognitive ease through conversational language: Robert explains payment guarantees, damage deposits, and pricing in plain, concrete terms. But when the host transitions to the website to independently verify these claims (as Diane explicitly requests at 15:59: 'I want to read the whole website'), the language changes. Legal terminology, technical jargon, and formal copy replace the conversational register. Kahneman's research on illusions of truth shows that familiarity drives truth perception: 'A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.' The corollary is that when the website uses different words for the same concepts Robert explained, those concepts lose their truth-feeling. The host encounters the same value propositions but does not recognize them as the same claims she already accepted on the call, because the language has shifted. This creates a cognitive strain moment precisely when the host is performing independent verification.",
      "solution": "Audit every key value proposition on the website against the language agents actually use on calls. Where they diverge, change the website to match the call language, not the other way around. Specifically: (1) The payment guarantee should use the exact phrasing Robert used: 'We guarantee that we will collect the payment and pay you' -- not 'Split Lease acts as a payment intermediary facilitating transactions between parties.' (2) The damage deposit matching should say 'If the damage exceeds your deposit, we will match for the same amount' -- not 'Supplemental damage protection up to 100% of the security deposit.' (3) Create a language concordance document that maps every call-script phrase to its website equivalent, and enforce that the website version is no more than one register-level away from the call version. (4) Repeat the core value propositions in the same language at every phase transition: onboarding welcome, listing creation confirmation, pricing setup, and proposal receipt.",

      "problem": "Experienced hosts like Diane use pattern-matching from prior rental experience to evaluate the platform, and they conflate surface-level familiarity with genuine understanding. When Robert explains the pricing model (variable rates by nights-per-week, complementary schedule matching), Diane responds at 14:20: 'I just did all of that for years... I'm familiar.' But Split Lease's pricing model has unique elements she has never encountered: per-night rates that vary based on how many nights per week a guest books, complementary schedule matching between two part-time tenants, and week-over-week alternating occupancy. Kahneman's 'Illusions of Truth' research explains this: 'The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true.' Diane recognizes 'nightly pricing' from her 15 years of hosting UN diplomats and maps the entire Split Lease model onto her existing mental model. The differences -- which are precisely what makes Split Lease's model work -- are invisible to her. This creates downstream failures when the actual pricing mechanics differ from what she expects.",
      "solution": "At critical configuration points (pricing setup, lease term selection, schedule creation), introduce deliberate comprehension checkpoints that surface the differences between Split Lease's model and standard rental models. This means: (1) When a host sets pricing, show a concrete scenario with real numbers before confirming: 'If a guest books Monday-Thursday (4 nights) at your rate of $50/night, you earn $200/week. If a different guest books only Tuesday-Wednesday (2 nights) at your rate of $60/night, you earn $120/week. Confirm these are your preferred rates.' The scenario forces System 2 engagement with the specific mechanics. (2) Use 'Did you know?' friction points that briefly highlight what is different about Split Lease: 'Unlike nightly rentals, your guest signs a 3-6 month lease for specific days each week.' This is not general education -- it targets the specific assumptions an experienced host carries. (3) After the host confirms pricing, show a monthly projection that makes the complementary-schedule model concrete: 'With these rates, if both slots fill, your monthly income would be approximately $X.' (4) Use Kahneman's finding that cognitive strain activates System 2 to design these moments: a brief, deliberate friction that prevents false confidence from becoming a setup error.",

Asking them to recreate this information from scratch on a new platform is pure cognitive waste -- it produces no new value and consumes System 2 resources that have already been spent once. Robert offers two paths: create your own listing, or provide a link and the team pulls the data (10:32-11:03). But both paths are presented as equal options. For an experienced host with existing listings, the import path is not just a convenience -- it is the only path consistent with cognitive ease. Kahneman's principle that 'anything you can do to reduce cognitive strain will help' applies directly: the import path eliminates strain entirely for the listing content, while the manual path multiplies strain across every property. For Diane with three properties, the difference is not 1x versus 1x -- it is 0x effort versus 3x effort.",

This means: (1) During onboarding or the sales call, ask one qualifying question: 'Do you already have listings on another site?' If yes, the import path activates automatically. The manual creation path becomes the secondary option, not the other way around. (2) When the import is complete, send the host a single verification task per property -- not a full listing editor, but a summary card showing key details (photos, price, description) with a single 'Looks good' or 'Edit' choice. The verification must feel like approval, not like work. (3) For multi-property hosts, batch the verification: show all imported listings on a single screen with individual approve/edit toggles, so the host can verify three properties in one session rather than three separate sessions. (4) If the imported data is incomplete, pre-fill what was imported and highlight only the gaps.

The pre-creation pattern fails because it removes agency from a host whose System 2 is still engaged and wants to verify before committing. Kahneman's framework explains why: cognitive strain from novelty has not yet been resolved. When a host is in a strained state ('you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious'), having decisions made for them does not reduce strain -- it increases suspicion. The pre-created account feels like a fait accompli rather than a convenience. The host perceives a loss of control, which triggers the opposite of cognitive ease.",

Click here to review and activate when you are ready.' The preparation is done, but the host initiates. (2) The invitation landing page should show what the agent prepared (property addresses, imported listing drafts, agent's contact) without requiring login. The host can browse and evaluate before deciding to activate. This satisfies Diane's desire to 'read the whole website' while also showing her the account is ready. (3) Never frame the pre-creation as something that has already been decided.

But most platforms make successful interactions invisible -- payments deposit silently, uneventful stays produce no feedback, and smooth interactions leave no trace. Kahneman's research on the mere exposure effect shows that 'the repeated exposure of a stimulus is followed by nothing bad. Such a stimulus will eventually become a safety signal.' But for this to work, the host must be conscious of the repeated positive exposures. Diane's prior experience illustrates the stakes: she had 'pretty good people, steady' for years (06:23), but when COVID disrupted payments, she had no reservoir of visible positive history to weigh against the disruption. Each successful month had been invisible, so the failures dominated her memory. The platform must make the positive repetitions visible to build a defensible safety signal.",
      "solution": "Design the active lease experience to make every successful interaction a visible, recorded exposure that accumulates into a trust record. This means: (1) After every successful payment, show the host a brief confirmation that includes a running count: 'Payment received -- 4 of 6 months completed successfully.' This makes the positive pattern salient. (2) At the end of each guest stay or lease cycle, generate a brief summary: 'Lease completed. 0 damage claims. 6/6 payments on time. Guest rating: 4.8.' This is the host's evidence that the platform works. (3) On the host dashboard, display a 'track record' section that shows the cumulative history of successful transactions across all properties. For a multi-property host like Diane, this compounds: 3 properties x 6 months = 18 visible positive events. (4) When a negative event does occur (late payment, damage claim), the visible history of positive events provides context. Instead of 'There is a problem,' the message is '17 of 18 payments on time. One payment is 3 days late -- here is what we are doing about it.' The positive history cushions the negative event.",

      "problem": "Diane represents a host profile where extreme time poverty is the dominant constraint. She describes her schedule as 'the day is never long enough' (00:49) and manages multiple properties across Manhattan and Queens. For this host type, any platform interaction that requires more than a few minutes of focused attention will be deferred indefinitely. Kahneman's insight that 'System 2 is lazy and mental effort is aversive' combines with time poverty to create a compounding effect: not only is the mental effort aversive, but there is no time slot in which to exert it. The standard design assumption -- that the user will sit down and complete a multi-step process in one session -- fails for time-poor multi-property hosts. Every task that cannot be completed in the margin of a busy day (waiting for a call, riding the subway, between meetings) will never be completed at all.",
      "solution": "Design every host-facing interaction to be completable in under 2 minutes, or to be fully asynchronous with save-and-resume. This means: (1) Break every multi-step process into atomic tasks that can each be completed in under 2 minutes. Listing verification: 2 minutes. Pricing setup for one property: 2 minutes. Proposal review: 2 minutes. Each task should have a clear start, a clear end, and produce a visible result. (2) Send task prompts via the channel the host already uses (text, email) with direct deep links that open to the exact task, not to a dashboard that requires navigation. Diane should receive a text: 'Your Manhattan listing is ready to verify -- tap here to review (2 min).' (3) Allow every task to be abandoned and resumed without data loss. If the host starts pricing setup and gets interrupted after 45 seconds, the 45 seconds of work must be preserved. (4) For multi-property hosts, sequence tasks across properties rather than requiring all at once: 'Verify Manhattan listing today, Queens listings tomorrow.' Spread the effort across multiple short sessions rather than requiring one long session. (5) Never require the host to be at a computer. Every task must be completable on a phone screen.",

          "insight": "For a time-poor host, the mere perception of effort is enough to defer a task. If the platform presents a listing creation flow that looks like it will take 15 minutes, the host will not start it -- not because the effort is too great, but because the perceived effort exceeds the time she has available right now."
