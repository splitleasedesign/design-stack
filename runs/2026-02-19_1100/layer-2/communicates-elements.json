      "problem": "Diane explicitly states she wants to 'read the whole website' (15:59) before proceeding, creating a critical handoff where the platform must independently replicate the cognitive ease that Robert built conversationally. The call delivered value propositions in a specific order using specific words: payment guarantee ('We guarantee that we will collect the payment and pay you,' 04:36), damage matching ('if the damage exceeds the $500, we will match for the same amount,' 05:28), no host fees ('all our income comes from markup to the guests,' 11:28). If the website presents these same propositions in different words, in a different order, or buried in different page sections, Kahneman's illusions-of-truth research predicts Diane will not recognize them as the same claims she already accepted. The information hierarchy of the website must echo the information hierarchy of the call, because the call is the host's first mental model of what this platform is.",
      "solution": "Structure every host-facing platform page so that the primary information layer uses the same phrases, in the same conceptual order, that agents use on sales calls. Specifically: (1) The homepage or host landing page should lead with the three guarantees in call order: payment collection guarantee, damage deposit matching, zero host fees. (2) Each guarantee should use the agent's conversational phrasing as the headline, with formal/legal language available only as a secondary expandable layer. (3) The onboarding welcome screen should open with the specific value propositions Robert mentioned, not generic platform features. (4) Create an explicit mapping between the call script and the website copy, and treat the call language as the canonical version -- the website adapts to the call, not the reverse.",

      "journey_phases": ["pricing", "listing_creation"],
      "problem": "Robert's pricing explanation (12:29-13:49) is the most cognitively demanding part of the call: variable rates by nights-per-week, different prices for 4-night versus 2-night stays, complementary schedule matching, and per-month versus per-week versus per-night structures. On the call, this complexity was manageable because Robert walked through it as a sequence of concrete scenarios with specific numbers ('If you have a person four nights, how much per day... and how much per day if you will have two nights'). Diane responded with confident familiarity ('I just did all of that for years... I'm familiar,' 14:20), but Kahneman's framework warns this confidence is an illusion of truth -- she pattern-matched 'nightly pricing' to her 15 years of hotel-style rentals without engaging with the novel elements. When she encounters the pricing interface, if it presents all options simultaneously as a form or matrix, the conversational scaffolding disappears and the cognitive load spikes. A multi-variable pricing matrix is the opposite of how Robert explained it.",
      "solution": "Structure the pricing interface as a sequential scenario walkthrough, mirroring how Robert explained it on the call. (1) Start with one question: 'How do you want to rent this place?' with three clear options: full-time (per month), alternating weeks (per week), or part of the week (per night). (2) Based on the host's selection, present one follow-up scenario at a time. For part-of-week: 'If a guest books 4 nights per week, what would you charge per night?' followed separately by 'If a guest books only 2 nights per week, what would you charge per night?' (3) After input, show a concrete projection: 'At these rates, a 4-night guest pays you $200/week. A 2-night guest pays you $120/week.' (4) Only after the host confirms understanding, show the full pricing summary with all scenarios together. Never start with the summary.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_mgmt", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Diane's 15 years of hosting UN diplomats involved in-person guest evaluation. Her instinctive question at 09:48 ('So I don't need them first to see?') reveals that her mental model of guest vetting is physical: seeing the person, reading body language, assessing trustworthiness face-to-face. The platform restricts direct communication until the lease is signed ('people cannot communicate except through our site,' 08:47), and substitutes a Zoom meeting option. But the proposal management interface must bridge the gap between Diane's rich physical evaluation mental model and the digital proposal format. If the guest profile feels thin -- a name, a few lines of text, no photo or context -- the information poverty will trigger the vigilance-and-suspicion cluster that Kahneman associates with cognitive strain. The guest profile must feel as informationally rich as meeting someone in person.",
      "solution": "Design the guest proposal profile to provide informational richness that compensates for the absence of physical meeting. (1) Lead with the guest's stated purpose: 'Commuter, works in Manhattan Mon-Thu' or 'Divorced parent, sees children every other weekend.' Purpose is what Diane evaluated first with her diplomat tenants -- why someone needs the space. (2) Show verified information prominently: employment verification status, ID verification status, prior Split Lease history if any. Verification badges serve as digital substitutes for in-person trust signals. (3) Include the guest's proposed schedule in visual calendar format, not text. The schedule is concrete and factual, producing cognitive ease where biographical text might feel vague. (4) Offer the Zoom meeting option as a prominent call-to-action, not a buried link. For hosts like Diane who are accustomed to in-person evaluation, the Zoom option is not a nice-to-have -- it is the bridge between her old mental model and the new one. (5) Show the guest's message to the host, in the guest's own words, prominently. A human voice in text produces more cognitive ease than platform-generated summaries.",

      "problem": "Diane's COVID experience reveals what happens when years of successful hosting leave no visible record. She had 'pretty good people, steady' for years (06:23), but when disruptions came, there was no accumulated evidence of reliability to contextualize the failure. Each successful month had been invisible, so the failures dominated her perception. On a platform, the same dynamic applies: if payments deposit silently, uneventful stays produce no feedback, and smooth interactions leave no trace, then the first problem becomes the host's entire story about the platform. Kahneman's mere exposure research shows that repeated positive exposure builds safety signals, but only if the host is conscious of the repetition. Silent success is wasted exposure -- the host's System 1 cannot form a positive association with something it never noticed.",

(1) After every on-time payment, display a confirmation that includes a running count: 'Payment 4 of 6 received on time -- $800 deposited.' The count makes the pattern salient. (2) At the end of each lease or stay cycle, generate a brief summary card: '6/6 payments on time. 0 damage claims. $4,800 total earned.' This is the host's evidence that the platform works. (3) On the host's main dashboard, maintain a persistent 'track record' section showing cumulative stats across all properties and all leases: total payments received, on-time percentage, total earned, damage claims ratio. For a multi-property host like Diane, this compounds visibly. (4) When a negative event occurs, present it in the context of the positive history: '17 of 18 payments on time. 1 payment 3 days late -- here is what we are doing.'

      "problem": "Robert offers to pre-create Diane's account (10:07), but Diane explicitly pushes back: 'I want to read the whole website' (15:59). At 16:38 she asks 'What should I look for? What's the name of it?' -- revealing that after a 17-minute call, she does not even know the platform name well enough to find it independently. The platform has not yet achieved the mere-exposure familiarity threshold that Kahneman identifies as necessary for positive feelings. In this state of cognitive strain (unfamiliar platform, no prior exposure, novel business model), having an account pre-created without consent does not reduce strain -- it triggers the vigilance-and-suspicion cluster. The information architecture of the evaluation-to-onboarding transition must let the host browse, verify, and build familiarity before any account action is taken on her behalf.",
      "solution": "Design the post-call landing experience as an explorable preview that requires zero commitment. (1) The agent sends a single link that opens a personalized, no-login-required preview page: 'Robert prepared this for you -- browse at your pace.' The page shows: the three guarantees in call language, a preview of what the host's imported listing would look like, and the agent's contact information. (2) The preview page is fully browsable without account creation. The host can explore the platform, read about the model, and verify claims from the call, all without logging in. (3) Only after the host has browsed does the page present a clear activation action: 'Ready to get started? Claim your account.' The language frames the host as the agent: she claims, she activates, she decides. Nothing has been created for her -- everything has been prepared for her to accept when ready. (4) The preview page uses the same language Robert used on the call, creating phrase-level recognition at first contact with the platform.",
