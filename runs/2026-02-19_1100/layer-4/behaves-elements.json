      "problem": "Robert offers Diane a listing import path (10:32-11:03): provide a link, the team pulls the data, and she verifies. For a host with three properties and extreme time poverty ('the day is never long enough,' 00:49), this is the only viable path. But the import creates a latency gap: the host provides a link, days pass while the team scrapes data, then an email arrives asking for verification. During this gap, every moment of silence is a moment where cognitive ease decays. Kahneman's mere exposure research shows that positive feelings require repeated stimulus; absence of stimulus resets the familiarity counter. The host who felt good about the call forgets the feeling while waiting for the import. When the verification email arrives, she is effectively a cold lead re-encountering an unfamiliar platform. The interaction pattern must eliminate this latency gap or fill it with ease-building micro-exposures.",
      "solution": "Treat the listing import as an optimistic operation with immediate visual feedback and progressive refinement. When the host provides an existing listing link: (1) show an instant skeleton preview of what the imported listing will look like, populated with whatever metadata is immediately available (title, first photo, location), within 2 seconds of link submission. This is the 'I heard you' acknowledgment. (2) As the import completes field by field over the following hours, send the host a lightweight progress notification: 'Your Manhattan listing is 80% imported -- photos, description, and amenities are ready. We still need your pricing.' Each notification is a mere-exposure event. (3) When the import is complete, deliver a single verification card per property -- not a full form, but a summary with 'Looks good' or 'Edit' actions. The verification must feel like approval, not work. (4) For multi-property hosts, sequence verifications across days rather than bundling them: verify Manhattan today, Queens Building 1 tomorrow.",

But Split Lease's pricing model has genuinely novel elements -- per-night rates that vary by number of nights booked per week, complementary schedule matching, alternating occupancy -- that her 15 years of nightly UN diplomat rentals never involved. Kahneman's illusions of truth research explains: 'The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true.' The phrase 'per night' triggered pattern-matching to her old model, making the entire Split Lease pricing structure feel understood when it was only recognized. If the pricing interface accepts her inputs without surfacing the differences, she will misconfigure her rates and discover the mismatch only when active leases produce unexpected income. The interaction pattern must introduce deliberate friction at the confirmation step -- not to slow her down, but to surface what is genuinely different.",
      "solution": "After the host enters all pricing values through the sequential scenario flow (one question per card, per L2/L3), present a confirmation card that introduces controlled cognitive strain by showing a concrete real-dollar scenario that reveals the novel mechanics. This card does not repeat the numbers the host entered -- it shows what those numbers produce in practice. Specifically: (1) 'With your rates, here is what a typical month looks like:' followed by a concrete scenario showing Guest A (Mon-Thu, 4 nights x $50 = $200/week = $800/month) and Guest B (Fri-Sat, 2 nights x $60 = $120/week = $480/month), with total monthly income in mono typography. (2) Highlight the element that is novel: 'Because your rate changes based on how many nights a guest books, a 2-night guest pays more per night than a 4-night guest. Is this what you intended?' (3) Require explicit confirmation: a single 'Yes, these rates are correct' button. No auto-advance. The host must actively affirm after seeing the projection.

When the first problem occurs -- a late payment, a guest dispute, a damage claim -- the host has no reservoir of visible platform successes to draw on. The single negative event defines her entire perception.

Silent deposits are not perceived as platform events.",

(1) After each on-time payment, push a confirmation notification (email or in-app) showing: amount received, running count ('Payment 4 of 6'), and cumulative earnings this lease ('$3,200 total'). The notification uses mono typography for financial figures and the platform's visual identity anchors (brand purple, warm background). (2) On the host dashboard, render the payment history as a row of circular badges -- one per payment period. Completed payments fill with the accent color and show a checkmark. Upcoming payments are outlined. The visual effect: a progress bar made of discrete, countable units. (3) When the badge for a new payment fills, animate it with a gentle settle (300ms, easing-out) to draw the eye. (4) When a negative event occurs (late payment, damage claim), present it within the context of the positive record: '5 of 6 payments on time. 1 payment is 3 days late -- here is what we are doing.'

When Diane transitions to the website ('I want to read the whole website,' 15:59), she moves from a warm human context to a cold digital one. Kahneman's framework predicts the consequences: 'When you feel strained, you are more likely to be vigilant and suspicious.' A website that looks, sounds, or feels different from the call triggers the strain-vigilance-suspicion cluster. But the threat is not just tonal mismatch -- it is phrase-level discontinuity. Kahneman's illusions of truth research shows that familiarity operates at the phrase level: 'The familiarity of one phrase in the statement sufficed to make the whole statement feel familiar, and therefore true.' If the website says 'payment intermediation service' instead of 'we guarantee that we will collect the payment and pay you,' the concept is identical but the truth-feeling is destroyed because the specific phrase is unrecognized. The interaction pattern must ensure that the first 10 seconds of the host's website experience produce phrase-level recognition of the call's key claims.",

These are headlines in Instrument Serif on the warm background. (2) Each guarantee scrolls into view with a staggered entrance (300ms per item, 150ms delay between items, easing-out) -- the pacing mimics Robert's conversational rhythm of introducing one point at a time.
