      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation", "negotiation", "acceptance"],
      "problem": "The guest journey has actions at different commitment levels — browsing (low), proposing (medium), accepting (high) — but buttons are styled uniformly with the same solid purple treatment. This visual uniformity makes the non-binding proposal feel as weighty as the binding acceptance, causing hesitation at the wrong moment and insufficient gravity at the right moment. The book states: 'When you take a hierarchy-first approach to designing the actions on a page, the result is a much less busy UI that communicates more clearly.'",
      "solution": "Implement a three-tier button system that visually communicates commitment level: PRIMARY (binding actions: Accept Terms, Confirm Payment): solid background using gradient-purple-button, white text, full border-radius pill shape. SECONDARY (non-binding actions: Create Proposal, Express Interest): outline style with secondary-purple border, purple text, transparent background. TERTIARY (exploratory: View Details, Learn More): no border, text-purple color, underline on hover. Apply consistently across the journey so the guest develops visual literacy — they learn to associate solid purple with 'this counts' and outline with 'this is reversible'.",

      "problem": "William's core anxiety is physical cleanliness. The visual presentation of the platform is a proxy for the physical experience he will have. A cramped, tight interface subconsciously signals 'this is not a clean, organized operation.' Refactoring UI's white space principles state that developers add the minimum space to not look bad, when they should start with too much and remove. The current platform follows the add-minimum pattern, creating a visually dense experience that works against the trust-building needed for an anxious guest.",

(2) Section spacing: increase from 24px to 32px (--spacing-4xl). (3) Listing cards in search: increase gap from 16px to 24px. (4) Form field vertical spacing: increase from 16px to 24px between groups. (5) Stays Manager content padding: 24px minimum.

Spreading things out or making things unnecessarily wide just makes an interface harder to interpret.' For a guest evaluating a listing, wide content means more eye movement, slower scanning, and increased cognitive load.",
