When a hesitant guest like William arrives from Craigslist with no mental model of the platform, competing CTAs cause decision paralysis. The guest cannot determine what to do first, so he does nothing. The current UI treats every action as equally important, violating the fundamental principle that most pages have only one true primary action.",
      "solution": "Apply a strict action hierarchy to every page in the guest journey: (1) Identify the ONE primary action per page/state and give it dominant visual treatment (solid background, high contrast). (2) Relegate supporting actions to secondary treatment (outline, lower contrast). (3) Make exploratory/help actions tertiary (link-style, discoverable but unobtrusive). (4) The primary action should match the guest's current phase: Discovery = 'Browse Listings', Listing Evaluation = 'Create Proposal', Negotiation = 'Accept Terms'. No page should have two solid, high-contrast buttons competing for attention.",

The platform treats all listing information as equal, when in reality, some information resolves objections and some creates them.",

(2) Use the book's principle of grouping related information with unambiguous spacing — the cleaning protocol must be visually distinct from amenities.

      "problem": "The agent explicitly tells William that the 'bid does not mean that you are obligated' — it is a signal of interest. But the platform UI uses transactional language ('Submit Proposal', 'Create Proposal') that implies commitment. The word 'submit' in a financial context triggers loss aversion. When the button says 'Submit', the guest mentally models it as 'commit to pay'. This creates a disconnect between the verbal reassurance and the digital experience, undermining the trust the agent built.",
      "solution": "Redesign the proposal flow language and visual treatment to match the non-binding nature of the action: (1) Replace 'Submit Proposal' with 'Express Interest' or 'Send Request' — language that matches what the agent told William. (2) Use secondary button styling (outline or lower contrast) for the proposal action, reserving primary (solid, high contrast) for the final acceptance. (3) Add explicit reassurance text near the button: 'This is not a commitment. You can modify or withdraw at any time.' (4) Apply the Refactoring UI hierarchy principle: the proposal button is a secondary action (non-binding), and the acceptance button is the primary action (binding).",

      "problem": "When a guest like William is already anxious about sharing physical space with a stranger, the digital interface becomes a proxy for the physical experience. A cramped, inconsistent UI triggers the same distrust as an unkempt apartment. Currently, the platform lacks a consistent spacing system — padding values are arbitrary, margins vary between pages, and form fields are packed tightly. Refactoring UI demonstrates that inconsistent spacing is the #1 cause of interfaces looking 'off' even when individual components are well-designed.",
      "solution": "Implement a strict spacing and sizing system derived from a 16px base, applied across the entire guest journey: (1) Use a non-linear scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96px) where each step is at least 25% larger than the previous. (2) Start every layout with too much white space, then remove until satisfied — the default should be generous. (3) Apply the system consistently: form field spacing, card padding, section margins, and Stays Manager layout must all draw from the same scale. (4) For the Stays Manager (visited 13+ times), consistent spacing enables automatic navigation — the guest should not have to think about where things are.",

The page must answer these questions instantly, without requiring the guest to navigate, scroll, or interpret.

Only one primary action visible at a time, switching based on the stay lifecycle. (3) HISTORY ZONE (bottom): Past stays, payment history, cleaning photo log. Scrollable but not the focus.
