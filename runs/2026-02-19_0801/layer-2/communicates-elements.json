When it is buried among other details or absent entirely, the guest's anxiety compounds with each scroll. The information exists (separate linens, cleaning responsibilities, cleaning photos) but has no architectural prominence.",
      "solution": "Elevate the cleaning protocol to a standalone content block with its own visual container, positioned AFTER photos and BEFORE pricing on the listing page. Structure: (1) HEADLINE: 'How Cleanliness Works' (2) Three clear items: separate linens, cleaning responsibilities, cleaning photo verification (3) Visual icon for each item (4) Link to detailed cleaning standards page for guests who want more. On the Stays Manager, surface the last cleaning photo with timestamp as the FIRST element the guest sees.",

If the price appears too early (search cards) without context, it becomes the anchor and everything is evaluated against it. If price appears too late (only after proposal), the guest feels blindsided. Current info architecture shows nightly rate on search cards and a total on the proposal page, but the relationship between the two is not progressively revealed.",
      "solution": "Reveal pricing in three progressive stages matched to commitment level: (1) SEARCH: Show nightly rate range only (e.g., '$XX-XX/night') — no total, because duration is not set. This matches William's 'just looking' state. (2) LISTING EVALUATION: Show nightly rate + estimated 4-week total based on default configuration. As the guest adjusts dates/duration, the total updates live. (3) PROPOSAL CREATION: Show full breakdown — nightly rate, duration, total, first payment, recurring payments. Add comparison: 'vs. Airbnb: $XX/night for the same area'. Each stage reveals only what the guest needs for their current decision.",

      "problem": "The Stays Manager is visited 13+ times during a typical 3-month lease. Each visit has a different intent: sometimes the guest is checking status, sometimes submitting photos, sometimes requesting a date change. The current layout presents all information with equal weight — upcoming stays, past stays, payment info, date change tool, messages, cleaning photos — forcing the guest to scan the entire page to find what they need. For a weekly touchpoint, this friction is unacceptable. Refactoring UI's principle that 'dense UIs have their place' applies here: the Stays Manager should be information-dense but hierarchically organized.",
      "solution": "Structure the Stays Manager with a clear information hierarchy based on temporal relevance: (1) NOW: What is the guest's current status? (Next stay in 3 days, cleaning photos due, date change pending.) One sentence, top of page. (2) NEXT: What action does the guest need to take? (Confirm arrival, submit photos, review stay.) Single primary button. (3) HISTORY: What happened? (Past stays, payments, cleaning log.) Scrollable list below the fold.

If the spacing between a label and its input is the same as the spacing between input groups, the guest cannot tell which label belongs to which field. Refactoring UI explicitly warns: 'At best the user has to work harder to interpret the UI, and at worst it means accidentally putting the wrong data in the wrong field.' For a guest already uncertain about commitment, form confusion amplifies anxiety.",
      "solution": "Apply the unambiguous spacing principle: (1) Within a form group (label + input + helper text), use tight spacing (8px between label and input). (2) Between form groups, use generous spacing (24px minimum). (3) Between sections (dates section vs. pricing section), use a visual separator (border or background change) plus 32px+ spacing. (4) Group related controls: date range picker + duration selector are one group. Day-of-week selection is a separate group. Pricing summary is a separate section entirely.
