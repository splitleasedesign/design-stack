      "problem": "William's cleanliness anxiety ('I don't want to use somebody else's sheets') is not a rational objection — it is an emotional one. The visceral image of sleeping in a stranger's sheets triggers disgust, one of the most powerful negative emotions. No amount of logical reassurance ('we have cleaning protocols') will override this if the emotional channel is not addressed first. The platform currently speaks to the rational brain (policies, rules) without addressing the emotional brain (proof, visual assurance, hygiene cues).",
      "solution": "Design the cleanliness communication to target the emotional channel first: (1) On the listing page, use a visual 'Cleanliness Guarantee' badge with an icon (sparkle/shield) — visual > text for emotional processing. (2) Use specific, sensory language: 'Fresh linens, labeled and stored separately for each guest' — not 'Cleaning responsibilities are shared.' The first sentence creates an image; the second creates a policy. (3) In the Stays Manager, show the co-tenant's last cleaning photos BEFORE the guest arrives — visual proof resolves emotional anxiety faster than any text. (4) After the guest's first stay, prompt a 'Cleanliness Rating' (1-5 sparkles) — making the guest feel heard about their #1 concern.",

The guest has seen the listing, accepted the sharing model in principle, and now must take an action that feels like it costs something — even though the agent said it is non-binding.

The overall emotional tone of the proposal flow is 'transaction' when it should be 'conversation'.",
      "solution": "Reframe the proposal flow as an invitation rather than a transaction: (1) Replace 'Submit Proposal' with 'Send Your Interest' — language that mirrors the agent's verbal framing. (2) Replace the confirmation modal with inline feedback: 'Interest sent! The host will get back to you within 24 hours.' (3) Use a softer visual treatment for the proposal card: rounded corners, lower contrast background (bg-off-white), relaxed spacing — it should feel like a note, not a contract.
