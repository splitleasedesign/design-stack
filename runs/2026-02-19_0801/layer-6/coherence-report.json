The existing library element (System 1 Trust Gate) prescribes passing System 1 assessment at every phase transition. The new element (Stays Manager as Weekly Command Center) prescribes a three-zone layout optimized for 13+ weekly visits. Both share the same insight: the Stays Manager must be instantly comprehensible without conscious effort.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: associative coherence at transitions (Kahneman). New evidence: action hierarchy and spacing system (Refactoring UI) applied to the most-visited page. Combined insight: the Stays Manager must pass both the System 1 test (instant recognition) AND the action hierarchy test (single primary action per state). These are complementary rather than redundant — one addresses recognition, the other addresses action.",

The existing element (Match Platform's Cognitive Speed to Phone Call's Conversational Speed) prescribes platform interactions that match call efficiency. The new element (Systematic Spacing as Trust Infrastructure) prescribes a spacing system that enables automatic navigation — reducing the cognitive cost of every platform interaction.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: Andreas describes two units in 7 seconds, platform must match this speed. New evidence: a systematic spacing scale (16px base, non-linear) creates visual rhythm that enables faster scanning. Combined: cognitive speed is achieved not just through fewer interactions (existing) but also through predictable visual patterns (new). Spacing IS speed.",

      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence: the platform should feel like 'opening a letter from someone you just spoke with.'
