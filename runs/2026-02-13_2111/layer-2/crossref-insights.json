  "crossref_summary": "Of the 11 disappointments identified in Layer 1, 8 received transcript validation ranging from moderate to strong. The strongest validation clusters around three themes that real Split Lease users independently articulated: (1) Airbnb as a 'headache' and 'model of bad customer service' for hosts, with platform abandonment during crises and fee/tax opacity; (2) the desperate need for vetting, screening, and trust-building before allowing strangers into shared spaces; and (3) the superiority of recurring, relationship-based guest models over Airbnb's transactional one-time-guest approach. Four new discoveries emerged from transcripts that were NOT in Layer 1, including host-side platform abandonment frustration, the owner-occupant safety anxiety, the cleaning/turnover burden as a deal-breaker for split-week hosting, and the regulatory exodus from Airbnb creating a captive supply-side audience. The transcripts reveal that Airbnb's disappointments are not hypothetical -- they are actively pushing hosts and guests toward alternative arrangements, and the language they use to describe their frustrations maps precisely onto Split Lease's value proposition.",
