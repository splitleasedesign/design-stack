Every text label on the platform is a comprehension barrier. Weinschenk Ch. 14 establishes that reading and comprehending are separate cognitive processes -- Walaa may decode English words but fail to extract their meaning. Ch. 7 (affordances) establishes that visual cues communicate action faster than text. The production interface uses Inter and DM Sans at 14px base for body text, which is readable but language-neutral comprehension requires more than readable type. The platform currently relies on text labels for all actions and categories, creating a cumulative cognitive tax that compounds across phases for non-native speakers.",
      "solution": "Establish an icon-plus-text paired system where every actionable element and every information category uses a recognizable icon as the primary meaning carrier, with the text label as secondary confirmation. (1) Action buttons: Use 24px (--icon-md) icons inside all primary buttons, left-aligned before the text label. The icon carries the verb: a paper-plane icon for 'Send', a checkmark for 'Confirm', a calendar for 'Dates'. The button uses --gradient-purple-button with white icons and --font-inter at --text-base (14px) for the text. (2) Category tiles (House Manual, Stays Manager sections): Use 32px (--icon-xl) icons centered above one-word labels in --text-gray (#6b7280) at --text-sm (12px). Each tile sits in a --bg-white card with --shadow-sm and --rounded-xl (12px) corners, creating tappable affordances visible through peripheral vision (Ch. 2). (3) Status indicators: Replace text status labels ('Confirmed', 'Pending', 'Action Needed') with color-coded icon badges -- a filled purple circle for confirmed, an amber clock for pending, a red exclamation for action needed. Icons are 20px (--icon-sm) with no text at first scan; text appears on tap/hover for those who need it. (4) The icon set must remain stable across the entire lease -- same icons in same positions every visit, enabling Weinschenk Ch. 42 automaticity by week 5.",

      "problem": "Walaa's budget is monthly: '$600 to seven 50' (4:02). The platform displays nightly rates as primary pricing. Weinschenk Ch. 90 (people make most decisions unconsciously) means the first number Walaa sees triggers an automatic accept/reject evaluation. If that number is a nightly rate ($25-40), her unconscious system cannot compare it against her monthly frame ($600-750) -- the result is confusion, not evaluation. Ch. 28 (some mental processing is more challenging) confirms that frame translation is high-difficulty computation. The visual hierarchy of the price display directly determines whether Walaa can evaluate affordability. Currently, nightly rates use the same typographic weight and size as all other listing data, burying the budget-critical information in a uniform visual field.",

This creates two visually distinct week types: 4-night 'short weeks' and 7-night 'full weeks.' Weinschenk Ch. 3 (people identify objects by recognizing patterns) means the schedule display must make this alternating pattern instantly recognizable through visual differentiation, not text labels. A standard calendar view treats all weeks identically, which is incorrect for Walaa and forces her to mentally reconstruct which week is which -- an error-prone task (Ch. 88: people make predictable types of errors).

Contains: week-type color badge (looks-004 pattern), date range, night count, and ONE action button. The action button uses --gradient-purple-button, full width of the card, 48px height (--input-height-lg), with icon + text (looks-001 pattern). In weeks 1-2 the button is 'Confirm Arrival.' In weeks 3+ it may be 'Rate This Week' post-checkout. Only one button ever appears -- Weinschenk Ch. 92 warns against more choices than people can process. (2) Zone 2 -- Progress (middle, fixed position): A horizontal progress bar using --secondary-purple for completed segments and --bg-light-gray (#f3f4f6) for remaining. The current week is marked with a --primary-purple dot (12px). Below the bar: 'Week 8 of 13' in Inter 500 at --text-sm (12px), --text-gray. This zone is exactly 60px tall and never grows. (3) Zone 3 -- History (bottom, scrollable): A vertical feed of past week cards, each 56px height, showing: week-type icon, date range, emoji rating (if submitted), and payment status icon. Cards use --bg-light (#f9fafb) background, --border-light bottom separator. New items appear at the top. The feed grows as the lease progresses but the scroll container is fixed in position below Zone 2.",

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The platform needs 13+ reviews per lease, but traditional text reviews are impossible for Walaa given her language barrier and impossible for habit formation given the time cost. Weinschenk Ch. 57 (people are inherently lazy) means the review must be completable in the laziest possible way. Ch. 24 (people reconstruct memories) means the review must be captured within hours of checkout, not days later. Ch. 60 (habit formation requires small steps) means the review interaction must start as a single tap in early weeks and remain a single tap through late weeks. The visual design of the review prompt determines whether Walaa completes it or dismisses it. A text box is a wall. A tap target is a door.",
      "solution": "Design the micro-review as a single-screen emoji-scale overlay that appears 2-4 hours after predicted checkout. (1) The overlay is a bottom sheet (slides up from bottom, --rounded-2xl (16px) top corners, --bg-white, --shadow-lg). It contains exactly 5 emoji faces in a horizontal row, each 48px (--input-height-lg) touch target with 16px (--spacing-lg) gaps between them. The faces range from frowning to beaming, drawn in --primary-purple outline style (not yellow -- on-brand). (2) Tapping any face immediately submits the review, triggers a brief success animation (purple checkmark, 300ms, --easing-ease-out), and the bottom sheet slides down. Total interaction: one tap, under 5 seconds. (3) Below the emoji row, a single-line text input (--input-height, --rounded-lg, --border-color border) with placeholder 'Anything to mention? (optional)' in --text-light-gray. This field is visually subordinate: smaller, lighter, clearly optional. Tapping a face without typing submits a valid review. (4) The bottom sheet header: 'How was this week?' in Inter 600 at --text-lg (18px), --text-dark. No other text. No instructions. No rating explanation. (5) The selected face scales to 1.2x with a subtle --accent-purple glow (--shadow-purple-sm) as feedback before the sheet dismisses. (6) Occasionally (variable reward per Ch. 51), after submitting a review, Walaa sees: 'Your host rated this week [emoji face]' -- creating a reciprocal reveal that sustains engagement through unpredictability.",
