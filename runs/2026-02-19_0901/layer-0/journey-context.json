Principle #22 (It's easier to recognize information than recall it) is critical for the House Manual: Walaa should not have to remember instructions (Wi-Fi password, lockbox code, trash schedule) -- she should be able to recognize and find them in a reference document she can access on her phone. Given her language barrier, the House Manual must be visually structured, not text-heavy. Principle #7 (People see cues that tell them what to do with an object / affordances) applies to the physical space: Walaa needs clear affordances in both the digital House Manual and the physical space (labeled keys, clear signs). Walaa's preference to 'be alone' (2:30) but willingness to accept a female roommate 'if she needs sometimes' reveals move-in social anxiety that the platform should address -- who will be there, what to expect, how to handle shared spaces.",

      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Active lease is the most critical phase because it repeats weekly for 13+ weeks. Walaa will visit the Stays Manager weekly to track payments, manage dates, notify arrival, send cleaning photos, and review stays. Weinschenk's principle #60 (Forming a habit takes a long time and requires small steps) is foundational: the Stays Manager must be designed for habit formation through small, consistent, low-effort interactions. Principle #42 (Well-practiced skills don't require conscious attention) means that after several weeks, Walaa's interaction with the Stays Manager should become automatic -- but only if the interface is consistent and predictable. Principle #50 (People are more motivated as they get closer to a goal) means Walaa's engagement will increase as her lease end approaches, not decrease. Principle #55 (People are motivated by progress, mastery, and control) means showing her a progress bar (stays completed, payments made, reviews submitted) will sustain engagement. Walaa's alternating-weekend schedule creates a unique complexity: her Stays Manager view must handle weeks where she's there 4 nights (Mon-Thu) and weeks where she's there 7 nights (Mon-Sun), alternating. The Date Change Tool is especially important because her work situation is unstable ('I'm not fixing yet in this worker') -- she may need to add, remove, or swap dates frequently. Principle #94 (People may care about time more than money) suggests that date flexibility may be more important to Walaa than price flexibility. Weinschenk's principle #51 (Variable rewards are powerful) and #52 (Dopamine makes people addicted to seeking information) suggest that the Stays Manager should include variability -- perhaps host messages, neighborhood updates, or stay-specific details that change each week -- to maintain engagement. Principle #64 (People are hard-wired for imitation and empathy) and #65 (Doing things together bonds people together) suggest that the review system should foster connection, not just capture ratings. Principle #24 (People reconstruct memories each time they remember them) warns that stay reviews are reconstructed narratives, not objective records -- the platform should prompt reviews immediately after checkout when memory is freshest.",
