      "problem": "Walaa has limited English proficiency, evident throughout the call in fragmented speech ('you weren't asked how you should assist me or What was that?' at 0:41) and inability to articulate pricing comparisons ('if we make it like this, or if we make it their monthly' at 1:34). Every text-heavy interface forces her to read AND comprehend simultaneously, but Weinschenk Ch. 14 establishes these are two separate cognitive processes. Non-native speakers can decode words without extracting meaning. The platform currently relies on text labels, form instructions, and helper text that assume reading equals comprehension. For Walaa, every text-dependent interaction is a potential dropout point because the cognitive cost of translation-then-comprehension doubles the effort native speakers expend. This problem compounds across phases: listing descriptions, proposal configuration fields, House Manual instructions, and Stays Manager action labels all assume fluent reading comprehension.",
      "solution": "Redesign all guest-facing interfaces to prioritize recognition over recall (Weinschenk Ch. 22). Concretely: (1) Replace text labels with icon-plus-text pairs everywhere. The icon carries the meaning; the text confirms it. A bed icon next to '$650/mo' communicates 'this is the price for staying here' even if the word 'Monthly Rate' is not fully understood. (2) Use visual match indicators on listing pages: green checkmarks next to criteria that match the guest's stated preferences (budget range, location, gender preference), red X marks next to mismatches. Walaa should recognize whether a listing works for her without reading a single description paragraph. (3) In the House Manual, use photo-based instructions: a photo of the actual lock with an arrow, a photo of the Wi-Fi router with the password overlaid, a photo of the trash bins with the pickup day. Recognition of a real photo is faster and more universal than comprehension of written instructions. (4) In the Stays Manager, use consistent icon placement so that by week 3-4, Walaa's interaction becomes pattern recognition (Ch. 3), not reading comprehension. The calendar icon always means dates, the dollar icon always means payment, the star icon always means review.",

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The active_lease phase repeats for 13+ weeks, making it the single most important touchpoint for platform engagement. Weinschenk Ch. 60 establishes that habit formation requires a long time and small steps. But habits only form if the interaction is consistent, low-effort, and rewarding. Walaa's situation amplifies the difficulty: her alternating schedule (weekdays every week, weekends every other week) creates variable interaction patterns, her language barrier increases cognitive cost per visit, and her unstable work situation ('I'm not fixing yet in this worker' at 5:11) means her needs may change unpredictably. If the Stays Manager requires significant cognitive effort each week, Walaa will bypass it and revert to texting or calling the host directly. Weinschenk Ch. 42 (well-practiced skills don't require conscious attention) defines the target state: by week 5-6, the weekly Stays Manager interaction should be automatic. But this automaticity requires the interface to remain identical week after week -- any layout change, feature addition, or notification pattern change resets the learning curve.",
      "solution": "Design the Stays Manager weekly interaction as a graduated habit loop that starts simple and stays simple: (1) Week 1-2: The interaction is a single confirmation tap ('I'm here this week' or 'Arriving Monday'). No reviews, no photos, no additional tasks. The goal is establishing the visit pattern, not extracting data. (2) Week 3-4: Add one micro-task per visit: a one-tap stay rating (thumbs up/down) or a single-photo checkout confirmation. These are presented as optional but visible. (3) Week 5+: The guest has internalized the pattern. Now the full interaction set (confirm arrival, rate stay, submit photo) can be presented as a cohesive routine that takes under 60 seconds. (4) The interface layout MUST NOT change across weeks. The same icons in the same positions doing the same things. Weinschenk Ch. 42 says well-practiced skills become automatic -- but only if the skill stays the same. (5) Show progress: 'Week 8 of your stay. 5 reviews submitted. 3 cleaning photos uploaded.' Weinschenk Ch. 55 (progress, mastery, control) sustains motivation through visible accumulation. (6) Introduce variable rewards (Ch. 51): occasional host messages, neighborhood tips, or small platform acknowledgments ('You've been a great guest -- your host rated you 5 stars') to maintain dopamine-driven engagement.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_creation", "negotiation", "acceptance", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Walaa explicitly cannot commit to a lease duration: 'I don't know because no, I I'm not fixing yet in this worker, so I don't know how to be' (5:11-5:22). Her work situation is unstable, which makes her housing duration unknowable. This is not an edge case -- many guests in transitional housing situations share this uncertainty. Weinschenk Ch. 30 (the more uncertain people are, the more they defend their ideas) predicts that forcing Walaa to choose a duration she is uncertain about will trigger defensive refusal, not commitment. Ch. 93 (people think choice equals control) means offering a flexible-duration option gives her perceived control. Ch. 62 (people are motivated by autonomy) means month-to-month continuation respects her need for self-determination. The current process likely requires a duration at proposal creation, which is a structural blocker for guests like Walaa. Every commitment-requiring step -- proposal creation, negotiation, acceptance -- is compromised when the guest cannot anchor on a duration.",
      "solution": "Redesign the commitment flow to support graceful uncertainty: (1) At proposal creation, offer a 'Flexible / Open-ended' duration option alongside fixed durations (1 month, 2 months, 3 months). The flexible option means 'I'll stay at least 4 weeks and continue month-to-month until I give 2 weeks notice.' This gives the host predictability (minimum commitment) while giving Walaa the flexibility she needs. (2) During negotiation, if the host counters with a fixed duration, present Walaa with a clear comparison: 'Host prefers 3 months. You requested flexible. Here's the price difference.' Make the trade-off explicit so her unconscious decision system (Ch. 90) can evaluate it quickly. (3) At acceptance, frame the commitment as reversible: 'You're starting a stay that renews monthly. You can adjust or end your stay with 2 weeks notice.' Weinschenk Ch. 82 (people overestimate reactions to future events) means Walaa is more afraid of committing than the actual commitment warrants. Framing it as adjustable reduces this overestimation. (4) During active_lease, the Date Change Tool should reinforce the flexibility message: 'Need to change your dates? You're in control.' Weinschenk Ch. 55 (mastery and control) means every date change should feel like exercising autonomy, not requesting permission.",

Weinschenk Ch. 31 (people create mental models) and Ch. 32 (people interact with conceptual models) establish that Walaa has constructed a conceptual model where she is a passive recipient of human curation, not an active user of a platform. When the platform eventually requires her to act independently (evaluate a listing, create a proposal, configure dates), her mental model provides no preparation for this. The transition from 'Bryant does it' to 'I do it on a platform' is a mental model rupture that Ch. 84 (people want what is familiar when scared) predicts will trigger retreat to the familiar -- texting Bryant or abandoning entirely.

The text message IS the search interface for Walaa. She never needs to open a search page. (2) Phase 2 -- Guided Platform Entry: When Walaa taps a listing link, the listing page opens with a personalized header: 'Bryant picked this for you' and her match criteria highlighted (budget match: yes, location: Astoria, roommate: female). She evaluates within Bryant's context, not the platform's context. (3) Phase 3 -- Scaffolded Self-Service: If Walaa likes the listing, the next step is presented as 'Tell Bryant you're interested' (a single button), not 'Create Proposal.' Behind the scenes, this triggers the proposal flow, but from Walaa's perspective, she is communicating with Bryant, not operating a platform. (4) Phase 4 -- Gradual Independence: Over subsequent interactions (counter-offers, date selection, acceptance), the platform gradually introduces self-service elements while maintaining Bryant's presence as a safety net ('Need help? Bryant is here'). Weinschenk Ch. 60 (habit formation through small steps) applies: each interaction makes Walaa slightly more independent without ever forcing a sudden transition.",

By extension, the same price presented in different frames feels different. $25/night feels cheap; $750/month feels expensive -- even if they are roughly equivalent. Walaa's budget frame is monthly. If the platform presents prices in nightly rates, she cannot intuitively evaluate whether a listing fits her budget. Weinschenk Ch. 28 (some types of mental processing are more challenging than others) means the nightly-to-monthly conversion is not a simple arithmetic step -- it requires understanding her variable schedule (4-night weeks vs. 7-night weeks) and computing an average. This computation is beyond what a language-constrained, cognitively loaded guest will perform on her own.

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "With 13+ weekly stays, the review system has 13+ opportunities to capture feedback -- but only if reviews are prompted at the right moment. Weinschenk Ch. 24 (people reconstruct memories each time they remember them) means that a review submitted days after checkout is not a report of what happened but a reconstruction influenced by subsequent events, mood, and selective memory. Ch. 26 (the most vivid memories are wrong) compounds this: the reviews guests feel most confident about are the ones most distorted by emotional intensity. For Walaa, whose alternating schedule means she leaves every week (sometimes Friday morning for her other-state trip, sometimes Monday), the departure moment is the freshest memory point. If the platform waits until her next visit to prompt a review, the memory has already been reconstructed. Additionally, Walaa's language barrier means her reviews will be shorter and simpler -- but this is actually an advantage if the platform designs for one-tap micro-reviews rather than paragraph-length text reviews.",
      "solution": "Capture reviews within hours of checkout using a graduated micro-review format: (1) Trigger a push notification 2-4 hours after the guest's expected departure time (derived from their schedule pattern). The notification opens a single-screen micro-review: one emoji-scale rating (1-5 faces), one optional 'anything to mention?' text field. Total time: 10-15 seconds. (2) Weinschenk Ch. 57 (people are inherently lazy) means the review must be completable in the laziest possible way: a single tap on a face emoji submits a valid review. The text field is truly optional. (3) Accumulate micro-reviews into a temporal narrative visible to both guest and host: 'Week 1: great. Week 3: good. Week 5: great. Week 7: issue mentioned.' This narrative is more valuable than a single post-lease review because it captures mood trajectory, not a single reconstructed endpoint. (4) Weinschenk Ch. 51 (variable rewards are powerful) suggests that occasionally showing the guest their host's reciprocal rating ('Your host rated this week 5 stars') creates a variable-reward loop that sustains review submission. (5) At lease end, auto-generate a summary review from the accumulated micro-reviews: 'Your 13-week stay: 11 great weeks, 1 good week, 1 week with a maintenance note.' The guest confirms or edits this summary rather than writing from scratch -- recognition over recall (Ch. 22) applied to the review process itself.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_creation", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Walaa's schedule is not a simple fixed pattern -- it alternates biweekly: weekdays every week (Mon-Thu nights), plus every OTHER week she adds Fri-Sat-Sun nights. This creates two distinct week types: 4-night weeks and 7-night weeks, alternating. Weinschenk Ch. 3 (people identify objects by recognizing patterns) establishes that visual pattern recognition is the fastest cognitive pathway. But a standard calendar or day-of-week selector cannot represent alternation. If Walaa sees a simple Mon-Fri toggle, she will either over-select (every weekend, which is wrong) or under-select (no weekends, which is also wrong). Weinschenk Ch. 88 (people make predictable types of errors) predicts this misconfiguration with high confidence. The error is not the guest's fault -- it is a structural limitation of the interface. During active_lease, the Stays Manager must display her biweekly pattern in a way that she can recognize at a glance which type of week she is in, without reading a calendar and mentally computing whether this is an 'every other' weekend.",
      "solution": "Design schedule interfaces that natively support alternating patterns: (1) At proposal creation, after the guest selects 'weekdays,' offer a follow-up: 'What about weekends?' with three options: 'Every weekend,' 'Every other weekend,' or 'No weekends.' If 'every other weekend' is selected, ask which weekend is first. This two-step process captures Walaa's pattern without requiring her to understand a complex calendar interface. (2) In the Stays Manager, use visual pattern differentiation for the two week types. Weinschenk Ch. 3: use color-coding (e.g., blue for 4-night weeks, purple for 7-night weeks) and distinct icons (partial-circle for short weeks, full-circle for full weeks). Walaa should recognize her current week type from the icon/color without reading any text. (3) Show a 4-week lookahead that makes the alternating pattern visible: Short - Full - Short - Full. This visual rhythm reinforces the pattern and helps Walaa plan. (4) Weinschenk Ch. 6 (people scan screens based on past experience) means the schedule section must always be in the same location on the Stays Manager. Walaa's eyes should go to the same spot every week to check her schedule.",
