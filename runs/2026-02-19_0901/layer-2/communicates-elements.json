      "problem": "Walaa has exactly four evaluation criteria: price ($600-750/month), location (Astoria/Queens), roommate gender (female), and schedule compatibility (weekdays + every other weekend). When she taps a listing link from Bryant's text, she must determine whether this listing matches her criteria before anything else. Weinschenk Ch. 40 (attention is selective) means she will selectively attend to these four criteria and ignore everything else. But the listing page likely presents information in the marketplace's default hierarchy: photos first, then title, then price, then description, then amenities, then rules. Her four criteria are scattered across this hierarchy. Weinschenk Ch. 44 (sustained attention lasts about ten minutes) means if she cannot find her criteria quickly, she will abandon. The language barrier compounds this: even if the criteria are present, she may not recognize them in text form. The listing page's information architecture must reorganize around what this guest actually needs to know, not what the platform traditionally displays first.",
      "solution": "Restructure listing page information hierarchy around a criteria-match pattern: at the top of every listing, before photos or description, show a compact match summary that answers the guest's four questions with visual indicators. (1) Budget match: show 'Est. $680/mo' with a green checkmark or red warning relative to her stated $600-750 range. (2) Location match: show 'Astoria, Queens' with proximity indicator. (3) Roommate info: show gender icon(s) for current occupants. (4) Schedule fit: show a week-bar visualization with her needed nights highlighted vs. available nights. Each criterion uses an icon-plus-value pair so comprehension does not depend on reading labels. Below this match summary, show photos and details in progressive disclosure. The match summary is the scan entry point; everything else is confirmation detail.",

She will not search listings; Bryant will text her links. When she taps a link, her mental model is 'Bryant sent me this,' not 'I am browsing a marketplace.' Weinschenk Ch. 31 (people create mental models) establishes that Walaa has constructed a model where information flows through a trusted human, not through a platform interface. Ch. 32 (people interact with conceptual models) means the platform's self-service conceptual model directly conflicts with her human-mediated mental model. When information arrives without Bryant's context -- a generic listing page, an anonymous form, a platform notification -- Walaa loses the trust thread that motivated her to engage. The information architecture problem is not about what content to show, but about whose voice the content appears to come from.",
      "solution": "Thread the intermediary's context through every information touchpoint in the pre-lease journey. (1) When Bryant sends a listing link, the URL should carry a referral parameter that personalizes the landing page: 'Bryant recommended this for you' as a persistent context bar at the top of the listing. (2) On the listing page, show which of Walaa's criteria Bryant matched: 'Matches your budget ($680/mo is within your $600-750 range).' This requires Bryant to have logged her criteria during intake, which he already captured in the call. (3) At proposal creation, frame the action as communication with Bryant, not platform interaction: 'Tell Bryant you're interested' rather than 'Create Proposal.' (4) In all platform-generated messages (confirmations, status updates), include Bryant's name: 'Bryant is working on connecting you with this host.'

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation", "negotiation", "acceptance"],
      "problem": "Walaa states her budget as '$600 to seven 50' -- a monthly frame. The platform uses nightly rates and 4-week rent as its pricing architecture. This creates a frame mismatch at every price touchpoint. Weinschenk Ch. 28 (some types of mental processing are more challenging than others) establishes that translating between pricing frames requires a type of mental processing that is inherently more difficult than comparing like-for-like numbers. For Walaa, the translation is even harder because her alternating schedule means the monthly cost varies between 4-night weeks (~$100/week) and 7-night weeks (~$175/week), producing irregular monthly totals. She cannot perform this computation. If the first number she sees is '$25/night,' her unconscious decision system (Ch. 90) will process it as 'I don't know if this fits my budget' and generate confusion rather than evaluation. The pricing architecture must present numbers in her frame, not the platform's frame.",

(1) During listing evaluation: show 'Est. monthly cost: $XXX' as the primary price, computed from the guest's known schedule pattern (if captured during intake) or a default full-month estimate. Nightly rate appears as secondary text below. (2) During proposal creation: show a live-updating monthly total as the guest selects or confirms dates: 'This month: $680 (17 nights x $40).' The monthly total is visually dominant; the per-night breakdown is explanatory subtext. (3) During negotiation: when the host counters with a different nightly rate, show the impact in monthly terms: 'Host suggested $45/night. For your schedule, that is approximately $760/month.' Place this next to the guest's stated budget range for instant comparison. (4) At acceptance: the summary leads with 'Monthly Cost: $XXX' and 'First Payment: $XXX.' Nightly rate is a footnote. Weinschenk Ch. 90 (unconscious decisions) means the first number Walaa sees is the number her gut evaluates -- make it the monthly number she can compare to her budget.",

      "problem": "Walaa cannot commit to a lease duration: 'I don't know because no, I I'm not fixing yet in this worker, so I don't know how to be' (5:11-5:22). This is not reluctance to commit -- it is genuine inability to predict her own future. Weinschenk Ch. 30 (the more uncertain people are, the more they defend their ideas) predicts that if the proposal form forces a duration choice, Walaa will defensively refuse rather than guess. Ch. 93 (people think choice equals control) means offering a flexible option gives perceived control. But the information architecture problem goes deeper: every commitment-requiring screen (proposal creation, acceptance, lease terms) must communicate that flexibility is built in, not that rigidity is the default with flexibility as an exception. If the flexible option is buried below fixed durations or requires extra clicks to discover, the page's information hierarchy communicates that fixed commitment is normal and flexibility is unusual. For uncertain guests, this framing causes abandonment because they feel the platform is not designed for them.",
      "solution": "Design commitment screens with uncertainty as the default information state, not the exception. (1) At proposal creation, present duration options in this order: 'Flexible (month-to-month, 2 weeks notice)' first, then fixed durations (1 month, 2 months, 3 months) below. The flexible option is pre-selected. Weinschenk Ch. 57 (people are inherently lazy) means the pre-selected option is the one most guests will accept. (2) At acceptance, frame the commitment as reversible: lead with 'Your stay renews monthly' as the headline, not 'Lease Duration: Flexible.' The word 'renews' communicates ongoing control; the word 'lease' communicates lock-in. (3) During active_lease, show 'Currently on month 3. Renews automatically. Change or end anytime with 2 weeks notice.' This persistent reassurance prevents the uncertainty from resurfacing as anxiety each month. (4) The Date Change Tool link should appear on every active_lease screen, communicating that schedule modification is a first-class platform capability, not a support request.",

Weinschenk Ch. 22 (it's easier to recognize information than recall it) means the manual must be a recognition tool -- Walaa should see an icon and know what category it represents, not remember where information was stored. Ch. 23 (memory takes a lot of mental resources) means she cannot be expected to memorize information from the manual; she must be able to retrieve it instantly every time. Her language barrier makes a text-heavy manual nearly useless: she may read the words 'Garbage Collection Schedule' but not know which day to put the bins out or where the bins are. Weinschenk Ch. 7 (people see cues that tell them what to do with an object / affordances) means the manual's categories must have clear visual affordances that communicate 'tap here for Wi-Fi' without requiring text comprehension.",
      "solution": "Structure the House Manual as an icon-grid landing page with maximum 6 category tiles, each using a universally recognizable icon and a one-word label. (1) Wi-Fi tile: Wi-Fi icon + password displayed directly on the tile (no tap required for the most-needed info). (2) Keys/Access tile: key icon, tapping shows door code, lockbox location with photo, and key instructions. (3) Trash tile: bin icon, tapping shows pickup days with a simple Mon/Tue/Wed visual calendar and a photo of the actual bins. (4) Rules tile: house icon, tapping shows the top 3 rules as icon-plus-short-phrase pairs (quiet hours clock icon + '10pm-8am', no smoking icon, guest policy icon). (5) Emergency tile: red cross icon, tapping shows host phone number with one-tap call button, plus 911 reminder. (6) Neighborhood tile: map pin icon, tapping shows the 3 nearest essentials (grocery, pharmacy, transit) with walking-time estimates. Weinschenk Ch. 3 (pattern recognition) means each tile uses a distinct icon shape that Walaa can identify without reading. The grid layout remains constant throughout her lease so she builds spatial memory of where each category lives.",
