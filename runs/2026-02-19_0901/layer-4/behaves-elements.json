      "problem": "Walaa's entire trust relationship is with Bryant, not Split Lease. When she taps a listing link Bryant texted her, she lands on a generic platform page with no visual connection to the person she trusts. Weinschenk Ch. 79 (people use look and feel as their first indicator of trust) means this first platform encounter is a binary trust evaluation. Ch. 84 (people want what is familiar when scared) predicts that the absence of Bryant's context triggers retreat -- closing the browser and texting Bryant 'I don't understand this.' The transition from text message to platform page is a state change the user did not initiate and does not expect. The listing page must immediately resolve the question 'Is this still from Bryant?' through its interaction behavior, not just its visual design. If the page loads without acknowledging the referral source, every subsequent interaction inherits a trust deficit.",
      "solution": "When a listing URL contains an agent referral parameter, the page loads with a two-phase warm handoff interaction. Phase 1 (0-300ms): The agent context bar slides down from behind the navigation into its fixed position. It contains the agent's avatar, name, and a single line ('Bryant picked this for you'). This animation draws the eye to Bryant's familiar name before the listing content finishes loading, establishing trust continuity before evaluation begins. Phase 2 (300-600ms): The criteria-match summary (L2 communicates-001) fades in below the context bar, with each of the four match indicators (budget, location, roommate, schedule) appearing in staggered 75ms intervals. This progressive reveal directs attention to one criterion at a time, preventing the cognitive overload (Weinschenk Ch. 40, selective attention) that a simultaneous data dump would cause. The context bar remains fixed during scroll. After the guest's third platform visit, the context bar collapses to an avatar badge with a 200ms ease-out shrink, reflecting the graduated mental model transition (L1 works-004). Tapping the collapsed badge expands it back to full. Throughout the listing page, the 'Tell Bryant I'm interested' button (not 'Create Proposal') remains anchored at the bottom as a persistent action, framing all interaction as communication with Bryant rather than platform operation.",

The proposal creation form likely requires duration as a mandatory field. Weinschenk Ch. 30 (the more uncertain people are, the more they defend their ideas) predicts that forcing a duration choice triggers defensive refusal, not commitment. Ch. 93 (people think choice equals control) means the form must offer flexibility as the default, not as a hidden alternative. Ch. 86 (people make errors when under stress) means Walaa's housing urgency combined with work instability creates stress that degrades form completion accuracy. The interaction pattern must handle the state where the guest genuinely does not know a required field's value -- not through validation errors, but through uncertainty-safe defaults that let the guest proceed without lying or guessing.",
      "solution": "Redesign the proposal creation interaction to treat uncertainty as a valid input state. (1) Duration selection presents 4 options in a single horizontal row: 'Flexible' (pre-selected, highlighted), '1 month,' '2 months,' '3 months.' The Flexible option is visually distinct -- it uses the primary action color and a subtle pulse animation on first view to draw attention. Selecting Flexible immediately shows a reassurance tooltip: 'Stay as long as you need. Renews monthly. 2 weeks notice to end.' This appears for 3 seconds then fades, not requiring dismissal. (2) When the guest taps any duration option, the price summary below updates in real-time (under 200ms) showing the monthly cost for their schedule. The live update provides immediate feedback that the selection has been registered (Weinschenk Ch. 7, affordance cues). (3) If the host counters with a fixed duration during negotiation, the counter-offer screen presents a clear side-by-side comparison: left column shows 'Your request: Flexible,' right column shows 'Host prefers: 3 months,' with the monthly price difference clearly stated. A single 'Accept host's terms' or 'Keep flexible' toggle controls the response, reducing the negotiation to a binary choice. (4) At acceptance, the commitment is framed as reversible: 'Your stay renews monthly. Change or end anytime with 2 weeks notice.' The word 'lease' is avoided in the acceptance UI; 'stay' is used instead. Weinschenk Ch. 82 (people overestimate reactions to future events) means reducing the perceived magnitude of the commitment through language framing.",

      "problem": "Walaa's schedule alternates biweekly: Mon-Thu every week, plus Fri-Sat-Sun every other week. This creates two week types (4-night and 7-night) that a standard day-of-week picker cannot represent. Weinschenk Ch. 88 (people make predictable types of errors) predicts with near certainty that Walaa will misconfigure this pattern using a simple toggle interface -- either selecting every weekend (wrong) or no weekends (also wrong). Ch. 85 (people will always make mistakes) means the interface cannot rely on the guest getting it right the first time; it must prevent the error structurally. Ch. 86 (people make errors when under stress) compounds this: Walaa is stressed about housing and work, making error-prone configuration even more likely. The interaction must capture the alternating pattern through a guided flow that makes the correct configuration easier to achieve than the incorrect one.",
      "solution": "Replace the standard day-of-week picker with a two-step guided configuration flow. Step 1: 'Which days do you need each week?' presents a simplified weekday block (Mon-Thu pre-highlighted as a group, not individual toggles) and a weekend block (Fri-Sat-Sun). The guest taps the weekday block (single tap selects all 4 nights). Step 2: If the guest also taps the weekend block, a follow-up appears with smooth slide-down animation (250ms): 'Every weekend or every other weekend?' This is a binary choice, not a calendar. If 'Every other weekend' is selected, a third micro-step asks 'Starting this weekend or next weekend?' with a visual two-week preview showing which weekends are included. After configuration, the system generates a 4-week preview strip using the L3 looks-004 color-coded week cards (light/dark alternating pattern), which Walaa can visually verify: 'Does this look right? Short week - Full week - Short week - Full week.' A single 'Looks good' tap confirms. If the pattern is wrong, she taps any week card to adjust. This preview-before-commit interaction prevents misconfiguration by making the result visible before it becomes binding. In the Stays Manager during active_lease, the alternating pattern is pre-computed for the entire lease and displayed as a fixed visual rhythm.

Ch. 92 (people want more choices than they can process) warns against presenting multiple actions simultaneously. Walaa's language barrier means she navigates by position and pattern, not by reading. If the Stays Manager shows multiple buttons, tabs, or action options on each visit, the cognitive cost per visit stays high and habit formation never begins. The interaction must present exactly one action per visit, and that action must be completable in a single tap.

      "problem": "With 13+ weekly stays, the platform has 13+ opportunities to capture review data. But Weinschenk Ch. 24 (people reconstruct memories each time they remember them) means reviews prompted days after checkout are reconstructed narratives, not accurate accounts. Ch. 26 (the most vivid memories are wrong) compounds this: the review Walaa feels most confident about is the one most distorted by emotional intensity. The platform must capture feedback within hours of checkout, when the memory trace is freshest. Weinschenk Ch. 57 (people are inherently lazy) means the review must require the absolute minimum effort -- one tap. Ch. 60 (habit formation requires small steps) means the review interaction must start as nothing (weeks 1-2), become a single tap (weeks 3-4), and remain a single tap plus optional text (weeks 5+). For Walaa specifically, her language barrier makes text reviews impossible and emoji-based reviews essential. The interaction must be universally comprehensible regardless of English proficiency.",
      "solution": "The micro-review is triggered 2-4 hours after the guest's predicted checkout time (derived from their schedule pattern -- Thursday evening for short weeks, Sunday evening for full weeks). Trigger mechanism: a push notification with preview text 'How was this week?' opens a bottom sheet overlay (L3 looks-006). The bottom sheet contains: (1) A header: 'How was this week?' in 18px text. (2) Five emoji faces in a horizontal row, each 48px touch target with 16px gaps. The faces are on-brand purple outlines (not yellow system emojis). (3) Tapping any face immediately submits the review. The face scales to 1.2x with a purple glow (300ms), then the bottom sheet slides down (250ms). Total interaction: one tap, under 5 seconds. No confirmation screen, no additional steps. (4) Below the emoji row, a single-line text input with 'Anything to mention? (optional)' placeholder. This field is never required and is visually subordinate. In weeks 1-2, it is hidden entirely. In weeks 3-4, only the emoji row appears. In weeks 5+, the text field appears below the emojis. (5) Variable reward: after 40% of review submissions, a reciprocal reveal slides up: 'Your host rated this week [emoji].' This creates the variable reward loop (Weinschenk Ch. 51) that sustains the micro-review habit. The reveal is brief (2 seconds visible, then auto-dismisses) and creates curiosity for next week's review. (6) At lease end, the system auto-generates a summary from accumulated micro-reviews: '13 weeks: 10 great, 2 good, 1 mentioned an issue.' The guest confirms or edits the summary with a single tap -- recognition-based review (Ch. 22), not recall-based writing.",

Ch. 55 (people are motivated by progress, mastery, and control) means the Date Change Tool should reinforce Walaa's sense of agency over her living situation. If the Date Change Tool requires filling out a form, waiting for host approval, and receiving a confirmation, the interaction pattern feels like a bureaucratic request.

Each tap produces immediate visual feedback: added dates glow purple, removed dates fade to gray. A running cost adjustment appears in real-time: '+$40 for 1 extra night' or '-$40 for 1 fewer night.' The monthly summary updates live. (3) Pattern vs. one-off: After modifying dates, the tool asks: 'Just this week?' or 'Every week going forward?' If the guest selects 'Every week going forward' and the change affects the alternating pattern, the 4-week preview strip (from behaves-003) appears showing the new pattern for visual verification. (4) Confirmation: A single 'Save changes' button sends the modification. Optimistic UI: the Stays Manager immediately reflects the new dates. The host is notified asynchronously. If the host declines the change within 24 hours (rare for minor adjustments), the guest receives a notification: 'Your host suggested keeping the original dates. Chat with them?' with a direct message link. (5) Framing: The Date Change Tool header says 'Adjust your schedule' not 'Request a date change.' The language communicates ownership, not dependency.
