      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "search", "listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Walaa's only trust anchor is Bryant's voice. She found him through Craigslist, not through Split Lease. When she taps a listing link Bryant texts her, she crosses from a warm human channel (text conversation) into a cold digital channel (platform page). Weinschenk Ch. 79 (people use look and feel as their first indicator of trust) means this transition is a binary emotional evaluation: safe or threatening. Ch. 84 (people want what is familiar when scared) predicts that encountering an unfamiliar platform triggers a retreat instinct -- closing the browser, texting Bryant 'I don't understand.' The emotional challenge is not information delivery; it is trust continuity. Walaa must FEEL that Bryant is still with her when she enters the platform. Every pixel of the platform that does not reference Bryant is a pixel that communicates 'you are alone now.' For a guest with limited English proficiency, social isolation on an unfamiliar interface compounds into a paralyzing emotional state where neither comprehension nor action is possible.",
      "solution": "Design every pre-lease platform touchpoint to emotionally extend Bryant's presence. (1) The agent context bar (L3 looks-003, L4 behaves-001) is not just an information element -- it is an emotional anchor. Bryant's name and face must appear BEFORE any listing content loads. The 100ms load target ensures Walaa sees a familiar face before her threat-detection system activates. (2) Copy must use Bryant's name, not platform-speak: 'Bryant picked this for you' not 'Recommended listing.' The name carries emotional warmth; the platform label carries institutional coldness. (3) The action button frames all interaction as communication WITH Bryant, not operation OF a platform: 'Tell Bryant I'm interested' not 'Create Proposal.' This framing preserves the emotional relationship that motivated Walaa's engagement. (4) When the platform must communicate without Bryant's direct involvement (automated notifications, status updates), use warm, personal tone: 'Bryant is working on finding you options' not 'Your search is in progress.' (5) As Walaa becomes more familiar with the platform (visits 4+), Bryant's presence gracefully fades to a small avatar badge -- the emotional training wheels come off gradually, never abruptly.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation", "negotiation", "acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "Walaa has limited English proficiency. Throughout the call, she struggles to articulate basic needs: 'you weren't asked how you should assist me or What was that?' (0:41), 'if we make it like this, or if we make it their monthly' (1:34). Every platform interface that relies on text comprehension risks making Walaa feel inadequate. Weinschenk Ch. 14 (reading and comprehending are two different things) establishes that she may read words without extracting meaning. But the emotional consequence goes beyond confusion: when a person cannot understand an interface, they do not just feel lost -- they feel stupid. This emotional response is shame, and shame is one of the fastest paths to abandonment. The platform's language barrier is not just a usability problem; it is a dignity problem. Every confusing label, jargon term, or text-heavy screen is an implicit message: 'This was not designed for someone like you.' Weinschenk Ch. 86 (people make errors when stressed) compounds this: shame creates stress, stress creates errors, errors create more shame. This is a degradation spiral.",
      "solution": "Design every interface to protect the guest's sense of competence. (1) Icons carry meaning independently of text (L1 works-001, L3 looks-001). When Walaa sees a bed icon next to '$680/mo,' she understands 'this is the cost for staying here' without reading the label 'Estimated Monthly Rate.' The icon preserves her comprehension dignity by making understanding possible without language mastery. (2) Budget-match indicators (L2 communicates-001, L3 looks-002) answer her most important question -- 'Can I afford this?' -- through a green checkmark or red warning, not through text. She never has to parse pricing terminology to determine fit. (3) Error messages must never blame the user. Instead of 'Invalid selection,' show the correct option visually highlighted with a brief animation. Instead of 'Required field,' pre-populate fields from known data (Bryant captured her preferences during the call). (4) The House Manual (L2 communicates-006) uses photos of actual objects, not written descriptions. A photo of the actual Wi-Fi router with the password overlaid is universally comprehensible. (5) The overall emotional tone: the platform assumes you understand, and if something is unclear, it is the platform's failure, not yours.",

This is not reluctance -- it is genuine life instability. Her work situation is unfixed, and she cannot predict how long she will need housing. Weinschenk Ch. 82 (people overestimate reactions to future events) means Walaa fears commitment more than the actual commitment warrants. Ch. 30 (the more uncertain people are, the more they defend their ideas) means forcing a duration choice triggers defensive refusal. But the emotional reality goes deeper: being asked to commit to something you cannot predict feels like being asked to lie. It forces Walaa into an impossible position: guess wrong or don't proceed. This emotional bind -- where all available actions feel wrong -- creates paralysis. The platform must transform commitment from a trap into an expression of freedom.",

(1) At proposal creation (L4 behaves-002), the Flexible option is pre-selected AND emotionally framed: 'Stay as long as you need. Renews monthly. You're in control.' The word 'control' directly addresses the emotional deficit created by her unstable situation. (2) At acceptance, replace 'lease agreement' language with 'stay' language: 'Your stay begins Feb 24. It renews monthly. Change or end anytime with 2 weeks notice.' The word 'stay' is temporary and soft; 'lease' is legal and rigid. This is not just semantic -- it is emotional framing that determines whether Walaa feels trapped or free. (3) During active_lease, the Date Change Tool (L4 behaves-006) header says 'Adjust your schedule' not 'Request a date change.' Every interaction with dates reinforces autonomy. (4) Monthly renewal notifications: 'Your stay continues next month. Everything is the same -- or change it anytime.' This recurring reassurance prevents the uncertainty from crystallizing into chronic anxiety. (5) Weinschenk Ch. 93 (people think choice equals control): the mere existence of flexibility options -- even if Walaa never uses them -- makes her feel in control of her housing situation.",

      "problem": "Walaa reveals a nuanced social boundary: 'I prefer to be alone, but if she needs sometimes... see me female roommate' (2:04-2:30). She is not antisocial -- she is selectively social with clear conditions (female, occasional, not constant). This reveals social anxiety about shared living that the platform must address, not ignore. Weinschenk Ch. 66 (people expect online interactions to follow social rules) means the digital introduction to her roommate/host must follow the social norms Walaa expects -- gradual, respectful, boundary-aware. Ch. 65 (doing things together bonds people together) suggests that shared routines (like the Stays Manager review cycle) can build connection over time, but only if the connection-building is opt-in, not forced. The move-in moment is emotionally charged: Walaa enters a stranger's home, in a city where her social support is limited, with a language barrier that makes in-person interaction stressful. The platform can either amplify this anxiety (by leaving her unprepared) or reduce it (by scaffolding the social transition).",

(1) Before move-in, send Walaa a brief host profile that is warm but not overwhelming: host photo, first name, one sentence about them ('Maria has been hosting for 8 months and loves cooking'), and a single question Walaa can answer: 'Anything you'd like Maria to know before you arrive?' This question is OPTIONAL and can be answered with a single emoji (thumbs up = nothing special). The question gives Walaa agency over the introduction without requiring language fluency. (2) On move-in day, the platform sends a simple arrival message to both parties: 'Walaa is arriving today. Maria, here's a reminder of the House Manual link.' This sets expectations without forcing interaction. (3) The House Manual (L2 communicates-006) includes a 'Shared Spaces' section with photos and clear visual rules (quiet hours clock, kitchen shelf allocation photo). This removes the need for awkward in-person negotiation of boundaries. (4) During active_lease, the Stays Manager creates indirect connection: occasional host messages ('Maria says welcome back!') that build warmth without requiring direct social interaction.

      "problem": "Walaa's life is in flux: unstable work ('I'm not fixing yet in this worker'), uncertain duration, alternating travel schedule, limited social network, language barrier. She has very few sources of predictability and stability. Weinschenk Ch. 42 (well-practiced skills don't require conscious attention) and Ch. 60 (forming a habit takes a long time and small steps) describe how a consistent, low-effort weekly interaction can become automatic. But the emotional dimension of this habit goes beyond usability: for a guest whose life provides little consistency, the Stays Manager's predictable weekly rhythm becomes a source of emotional stability. It is the one thing that is the same every week -- same screen, same position, same action. Weinschenk Ch. 55 (people are motivated by progress, mastery, and control) means the progress bar showing completed stays gives Walaa a sense of accumulation and forward movement in a life that otherwise feels stalled. Ch. 77 (people are happier when busy) means the small weekly task (confirm arrival, rate stay) gives her purposeful engagement rather than passive drift.",
      "solution": "Design the Stays Manager's emotional arc as a source of grounding and accomplishment. (1) The three-zone fixed architecture (L3 looks-005, L4 behaves-004) is not just a layout decision -- it is an emotional commitment: 'This will always be here, the same way, every week.' The consistency IS the emotional message. (2) The progress bar (Zone 2) transforms a potentially endless-feeling stay into a journey with visible milestones. 'Week 5 of your stay' gives Walaa a sense of where she is in time. As the bar fills, she sees tangible evidence that she is building something -- a stay history, a review record, a pattern of responsible tenancy. Weinschenk Ch. 50 (more motivated as closer to goal) means the final weeks feel more meaningful, not less. (3) The variable reward system (L4 behaves-005): occasionally revealing the host's reciprocal rating ('Maria rated this week 5 stars') creates small moments of delight that break the monotony of a long stay without disrupting the predictable rhythm. (4) The completed-state message ('All set for this week') is an emotional punctuation mark: a brief moment of accomplishment that closes the weekly cycle cleanly. (5) Week-over-week consistency: the Stays Manager NEVER changes layout during the lease. This is not a design constraint -- it is an emotional promise.",

      "journey_phases": ["acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "The acceptance moment is peak anxiety. Walaa is committing money, time, and trust to a living situation, in a language she struggles with, on a platform she has never used, for a duration she cannot predict. Weinschenk Ch. 83 (people feel more positive before and after an event than during it) means the acceptance click itself is the emotional nadir -- the moment of maximum negativity. Ch. 82 (people overestimate reactions to future events) means Walaa has been dreading this moment more than the outcome warrants. The emotional design challenge is twofold: minimize friction AT the commitment moment, and provide immediate positive reinforcement AFTER it. The interval between clicking 'Accept' and receiving confirmation is an emotional vacuum where anxiety peaks. If this vacuum is even 2-3 seconds long with no feedback, Walaa may experience buyer's remorse before the confirmation arrives.",
      "solution": "Design a two-phase emotional decompression after acceptance. Phase 1 -- Instant Relief (0-500ms): The moment Walaa taps 'Accept,' the button immediately transforms into a confirmation state (purple fill spreading outward, checkmark appearing). No loading spinner. No 'Processing...' message. The optimistic UI communicates 'done' before the backend confirms. A short, warm message appears: 'You're all set. Your stay starts [date].' This message is the emotional exhale -- the anxiety peak is over. Phase 2 -- Warm Welcome (500ms-3s): Below the confirmation, a brief welcome card slides up with three pieces of concrete, actionable information: (1) 'Your host is Maria. She'll be ready for you.' (2) 'Your House Manual is ready -- tap to save it.' (3) 'Bryant is here if you need anything.' Weinschenk Ch. 74 (anecdotes persuade more than data) suggests adding a single guest testimonial at this moment: 'I was nervous too, but everything worked out great. -- Sarah, Queens guest.' This testimonial is more emotionally effective than showing contract terms. Phase 3 -- Pre-move-in calm: Between acceptance and move-in, send exactly one message per day with one useful piece of information (not a checklist): Day 1: 'Your House Manual is ready.' Day 2: 'Here is how to get to the apartment.' Day 3: 'Maria is expecting you tomorrow.' Each message reduces one source of move-in anxiety without creating information overload.",
