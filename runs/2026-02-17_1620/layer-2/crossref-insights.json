Across host and guest calls, people default to fast heuristics (reply speed, vibe, first impression), ask basic process questions late in the journey (because architecture is missing earlier), and create off-platform systems (texts, notes, inventory books) to manage risk and coordination. The evidence especially reinforces Layer 1's claims about weak trust defaults, unstructured commitment moments, and missing post-match guidance, while showing one additional category pattern: discovery via Craigslist creates an immediate legitimacy tax before platform value can even be evaluated.",
