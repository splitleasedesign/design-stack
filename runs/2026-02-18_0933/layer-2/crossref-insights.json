  "crossref_summary": "The Split Lease transcripts powerfully validate the core PadSplit disappointments, even though PadSplit itself is never directly mentioned. The transcripts reveal that the anxieties PadSplit fails to address are fundamental to the shared-housing category: who is the other person (disappoint-001/006), how do I trust a stranger with my space (disappoint-001), what happens when someone doesn't show up or needs to reschedule (disappoint-002/010), and how do I maintain standards when people I don't know are cycling through (disappoint-010). The most striking pattern is that Split Lease's agent-mediated model — sending LinkedIn profiles, hosting Zoom introductions, personally vetting guests — is solving the exact problems PadSplit's institutional model leaves unsolved. Susan Bryant's demand to 'see the room and the bathroom first' before her friend flies from Oregon, Sherene's insistence on doing 'very odd interviews' with every potential guest, Frederick/Valerie's concern about 'a different person' rotating through her space — these are all expressions of the trust vacuum that PadSplit's background-check-only screening creates. The Cold Start framework's concept of the 'hard side' maps directly to Split Lease hosts: they do more work, have higher expectations, and will try competitive products if not served well. The transcripts confirm that hosts ARE the hard side, and that the hard problem is compatibility and trust, not compliance and screening.",

Hosts are the hard side, and their complex workflow includes a multi-layered trust evaluation that no platform fully supports. The human agent (Bryant, Robert, Luis) serves as the trust bridge between institutional screening and personal compatibility. PadSplit removes this bridge entirely, replacing it with algorithmic compliance. Split Lease's competitive advantage is that it has human trust bridges; the question is whether the platform can eventually embed this trust-bridge function into product features."
