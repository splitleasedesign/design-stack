      "combined_evidence": "Design-stack evidence (guest-works-003): The Stays Manager is the most-visited page (13+ times per lease), and it must operate at System 1 speed. Reverse-benchmark evidence (PadSplit analysis): PadSplit's dashboard is a billing portal with zero progressive value -- month 1 = month 12. Chen's Engagement Effect (Ch. 3) requires 'introducing people to new use cases' over time. Combined: the Stays Manager is the right surface (validated by DS) and the engagement ladder is the right mechanism (validated by RB). Together they form the engagement engine that PadSplit structurally cannot build.",

The design-stack pipeline identified the Stays Manager as foundational through direct user analysis (Nneka, Brad, weekly visit patterns). The reverse-benchmark pipeline independently identified progressive engagement as the critical missing ingredient through competitor analysis (PadSplit's flatline experience). Finding the same surface from inside-out (user needs) and outside-in (competitor gaps) is the strongest possible validation signal. This is now the 8th independent process to identify the Stays Manager as foundational architecture."

Together they form a complete system: micro-reviews feed the Passport, and the Passport gives micro-reviews purpose beyond any single lease.",
      "combined_evidence": "Booking.com/Hooked run evidence: Eyal's Hook Model shows that single post-checkout reviews are structurally incapable of habit formation for 3+ month leases. The solution is one-tap micro-reviews at each weekly stay cycle (13+ per lease). PadSplit/Cold Start run evidence: Chen's Moat chapter shows that network effects create defensibility through switching costs. A portable reputation built from accumulated micro-reviews creates genuine switching costs -- leave Split Lease and lose months of verified trust.

The same principle -- bridge trust from a known context to an unknown context through visual, verbal, and social continuity -- applies from the macro (will I trust this platform?) to the micro (will I trust this housemate?).
