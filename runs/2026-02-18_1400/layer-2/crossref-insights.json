  "crossref_summary": "Scanning 21 guest transcripts and 46 host transcripts reveals that 9 of the 12 Anyplace disappointments have direct or parallel evidence in Split Lease's own user calls. The anchoring cluster is the most strongly validated: Shomit Ghosh explicitly tells the agent he 'thinks of this per month and then breaks it down per night,' the exact inverse of Anyplace's per-night-first architecture — a user independently expressing the monthly frame that Anyplace deliberately obscures. Tapper S demonstrates live sticker shock, doing real-time mental arithmetic when discovering the per-bedroom vs. per-apartment pricing discrepancy. The negotiation disappointment is validated with unusual depth: Chantel (host) discusses accepting a 10-15% discount window, Sherene's call shows active price negotiation between parties, and Walaa's agent explicitly promises 'I'll negotiate the best price for you' — proving that negotiation is already happening informally through agents, but the platform has no native mechanism for it. The trust vacuum at payment is validated by Jessica Filomeno demanding a confidentiality agreement before disclosing properties, Susan explicitly asking 'do you do background checks?' before considering a booking, and Hemeden insisting on meeting guests first to 'make sure they're not crazy.' Frederick's call surfaces a new discovery: unmet expectation about who shares the space — 'I thought I'd be sharing with the host, I thought it would be like, just me and the other person. Like I thought it'd be a little bit simpler.' This is a representativeness-gap disappointment specific to the split-lease model that has no Anyplace equivalent and represents a new trust vacuum unique to this product category. The active stay void receives the clearest platform evidence: Nneka's rescheduling call reveals that all mid-stay adjustments currently happen through direct texting, outside the platform entirely — the platform disappears after booking and users revert to SMS as their primary coordination tool.",
