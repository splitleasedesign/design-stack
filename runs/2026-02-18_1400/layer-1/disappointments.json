  "disappointment_summary": "Anyplace has built a competent mid-term rental marketplace that functions without breaking — and therein lies the disappointment. Every phase of the user journey works adequately while systematically exploiting the three Kahneman biases the platform claims to transcend with its 'professional' positioning. Per-night anchoring makes monthly costs feel abstract until checkout sticker shock arrives. Law-of-small-numbers exploitation lets a 4.9-star average on 4 reviews carry the same visual weight as 400 reviews. Discovery primes users with remote-work lifestyle imagery that the actual residential rental experience cannot match, creating a representativeness gap that produces negative reviews not from bad stays but from disappointed hotel expectations. The communication phase offers a plain text box to a property manager and calls it 'support.' Post-stay reviews capture vivid incidents rather than statistically representative experience, perpetuating a distorted data cycle. And after a stay ends, Anyplace has no mechanism to help users remember why they liked it — no memory management, no loyalty architecture, no preference capture. The coffee is not disgusting. The coffee is perfectly adequate and utterly unmemorable.",

They scroll, compare, and build preference rankings entirely on the per-night anchor. The monthly total only appears inside the individual listing page and then again at checkout.",
      "why_its_not_a_bug": "Per-night pricing is the category standard. Airbnb does it. Furnished Finder does it. Vrbo does it.

      "why_it_matters_psychologically": "Kahneman's anchoring research (Ch. 11) is unambiguous: 'Any number that you are asked to consider as a possible answer to an estimation problem will induce an anchoring effect.' The per-night number becomes the reference point for all subsequent price evaluations. A user anchored on '$89/night' who later sees the $4,005 total for 45 nights experiences that number relative to the anchor — it feels like a large jump even though it is mathematically predictable. Insufficient adjustment from anchor means users systematically underestimate their commitment during the search phase. Real-estate agents with 15 years of experience showed a 41-48% anchoring index when presented with asking prices — Anyplace users are doing the same thing on every search card they view.",

The checkout is not surprising because of dishonesty; it is surprising because anchoring is robust. The platform has created the anchor in search and then benefits from the commitment the user feels ('I already chose this one') when the full price lands.

The actual category — furnished residential rental managed by a small property operator — performs by entirely different standards.

Kahneman also shows that 'anchors that are obviously random can be just as effective as potentially informative anchors' — meaning the host's listed price functions as a powerful anchor even if it is based on arbitrary or outdated rate comparisons. A negotiation mechanism would allow both parties to collaborate on anchor-setting — which Kahneman's research shows produces better outcomes for both parties than unilateral anchor imposition.
