This is not a new problem introduced by this run — the token gap existed before this run — but it is visible in every element in this batch. Recommend a tokens.json refresh as a maintenance task before the next pipeline run, so that the next round of elements inherits a token system that matches actual implementations."

(3) What language do guests use when they discover seasonal pricing variability?",

Split Lease already has more active-stay infrastructure than Anyplace; the next step is proactive communication design.",

A focused competitor analysis of how review systems could capture base-rate data rather than availability-biased narratives (Kahneman Ch. 12) would fill the remaining gap.",
      "reason": "The review system is identified as a category blind spot in this run (signature_potential: medium in the competitor analysis). No element in the library addresses structured review collection that captures frequency data ('how many days had an issue?') rather than vivid incident narrative.

Anyplace's retention void (disappoint-010) was validated; the next step is designing the guest retention solution.",
