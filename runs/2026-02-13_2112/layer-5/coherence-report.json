What depletion effects occur from weekly cleaning responsibility? How does photo verification affect cognitive ease? Frederick's near-rejection of shared housing ('it might be a little too stressful') is a System 2 override of a System 1 threat assessment — exactly the kind of dynamic the Kahneman lens is built to analyze."
