Kahneman's ego depletion concept is especially relevant: a guest managing an active lease while also working a demanding job (hybrid workers are the target market, per Bryant at 11:27-12:03) is perpetually depleted. Every platform interaction during active_lease competes with the guest's work responsibilities for System 2 resources. The rescheduling process must therefore be near-zero cognitive effort, or the guest will simply skip it (leading to no-shows) or handle it through informal channels (text messages, which create no platform record). CRITICAL: The Guest Leases page and Stays Manager are the PRIMARY recurring touchpoints during active_lease. The guest returns to these every week. The Stays Manager tracks individual visits (Week 1, Week 2... Week 13+) with status badges (Not Started, In Progress, Completed) and per-stay actions (Review, Upload Photos, Report Issue). The Date Change section handles rescheduling with replace/add/swap mechanics, a Flexibility Score percentage, and fair market rate calculations.

Kahneman's bat-and-ball research (kahneman-part1-two-systems.txt, The Lazy System 2) shows that over 50% of elite university students fail simple arithmetic under cognitive ease. Guests who must translate between nightly and monthly formats at every phase accumulate pricing errors and distrust.

The guest journey is a long sequential chain of System 2 tasks: evaluating platform credibility (discovery), filtering and comparing (search), analyzing a listing (listing_evaluation), configuring and committing to terms (proposal_creation), processing counter-offers (negotiation), verifying final terms (acceptance), and managing schedule changes (active_lease). The parole judge study shows that depleted decision-makers default to denial -- the guest equivalent is abandonment at each phase transition.

When Brad requests rescheduling, his success depends on Nneka's Airbnb calendar -- a system he cannot see and may not know exists. Kahneman: 'System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains' (Plot Synopsis). The guest's model is 'this host has availability on Split Lease.' The reality is 'this host's availability depends on a different platform.' This hidden dependency creates unpredictable failures that the guest experiences as arbitrary rejection."

This knowledge exists in the sales team's heads but may not be reflected in the product's search filters, listing displays, or proposal defaults. The law of least effort (kahneman-part1-two-systems.txt, Attention and Effort) predicts that if the platform does not surface this pattern as a first-class search and configuration option, guests who match it must do extra System 2 work to configure their search and proposals to match their actual needs."
