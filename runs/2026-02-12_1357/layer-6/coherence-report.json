The pipeline element (communicates-005, behaves-004) covers process visibility but not the emotional celebration of 'I got a place to stay.' This is a missed emotional peak that could drive referral behavior.",
      "The transition from proposal_creation (commitment/anticipation) to negotiation (patience/assurance) involves a significant emotional downshift: the guest goes from actively configuring their ideal stay to passively waiting for a host response.

The arc is weakest at the journey endpoints: discovery and move_in have minimal or no emotional coverage, and acceptance lacks a dedicated emotional peak. The overall arc tells a coherent story of 'trust formation through transparency and ease' but has a notable valley at acceptance and a gap at move_in. The next lens should specifically target these under-covered phases. End-to-end, the emotional trajectory is: trust (discovery) -> efficiency (search) -> clarity (listing_evaluation) -> commitment (proposal) -> patience + fairness (negotiation) -> [GAP: relief] (acceptance) -> [GAP: confirmation] (move_in) -> belonging + freedom (active_lease). The two gaps are the highest-priority emotional design opportunities for the next run."
