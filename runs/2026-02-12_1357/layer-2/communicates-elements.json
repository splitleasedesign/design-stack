      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The Stays Manager presents all stays as a flat table with columns for Week #, Period, Status, and Actions. A guest with a 13-week lease sees 13 rows of equal visual weight. To answer the only question that matters on a weekly visit -- 'What do I need to do right now?' -- the guest must visually scan the table, skip past completed weeks, identify the current or next upcoming week, read its status, and determine the appropriate action. This is a System 2 scan task imposed on a page visited every week for 3+ months. Kahneman's research on cognitive ease demonstrates that repeated tasks should become easier with practice, but a table that grows with completed rows becomes harder to scan over time -- the opposite of skill acquisition. The hybrid worker target persona (Bryant at 10:17-12:17: 'Monday to Friday is a very popular usage pattern... 2-3 month commitments typical') checks this page on Monday mornings before heading to the property. Their System 2 is allocated to work responsibilities, not to parsing a data table. Layer 1 (works-003) identified the process problem; this element defines the information hierarchy that solves it.",
      "solution": "Structure the Stays Manager page around a single hero card for the current or next actionable stay, with all other information subordinated. The hero card answers the guest's weekly question in a single glance: the week number, the date range, the status, and the one action available (if any). Completed stays collapse into a summary line ('6 stays completed'). Future stays collapse into a count ('6 weeks remaining'). The full table is available as a secondary view for guests who want the complete picture, but it is never the default. The information hierarchy is: (1) current week card, (2) pending alerts (date changes, payments), (3) summary of past and future. This mirrors how a calendar app shows today's events first, not January 1st.",

The Nneka call reveals that even established lease pricing ($1,170-$1,175/month) requires translation between monthly and nightly formats. In the Stays Manager, the Payment Schedule shows individual payment rows ($1,400 + $60 maintenance = $1,460) without a cumulative total or comparison to the guest's expected monthly cost.

Nneka's call reveals that 'replace' and 'add' have fundamentally different pricing implications -- additions are at a 'different rate' (07:22-07:45) and seasonal pricing means even replacements can cost more (03:33-04:26). The guest's System 1 treats 'change my dates' as a single coherent action. It does not automatically decompose this into three options with three different financial consequences.

This creates a trust-destroying pattern: the guest commits at one price, then encounters a different price when rescheduling mid-lease. Kahneman's anchoring research demonstrates that the first number a person sees becomes their reference point; deviations from that anchor are experienced as gains or losses relative to it, not as objective market values. The listing page currently shows a single nightly rate ($300.98) and a single 4-week rent ($3,611.79). If the guest's lease spans two pricing seasons, they anchor on the rate shown at listing evaluation and experience any seasonal increase during the active lease as a penalty -- even if the higher rate was disclosed somewhere in the fine print. The information architecture must prevent this anchoring trap by surfacing rate variability before the guest's System 1 locks onto a single number.",

Weeks 1-12: $280/night. Weeks 13-20: $301/night. Total: $11,738.' At acceptance, the confirmation includes a one-line clause: 'Date changes are priced at the rate for the new dates.

The current design shows this as a horizontal progress tracker with stages marked completed, current, or upcoming. But the pipeline hides the most anxiety-producing information: who must act next and how long it will take. After submitting a proposal, the guest enters a waiting state with no visibility into whether the host has seen the proposal, is reviewing it, or has forgotten about it. Kahneman's research on uncertainty and System 2 activation predicts that unresolved uncertainty forces continuous System 2 monitoring: the guest cannot stop thinking about the pending proposal because they have no information to resolve the ambiguity. This cognitive drain persists for the entire waiting period, competing with the guest's work responsibilities and reducing their engagement with the platform. The Nneka call illustrates the downstream consequence: Brad ends up texting Nneka directly because the platform provides no status visibility.",
      "solution": "Transform the progress pipeline from a stage tracker into an action-assignment display. At every stage, the pipeline must answer three questions: (1) 'Where am I?' -- the current stage, highlighted. (2) 'What happens next?' -- a plain-language description of the next step. (3) 'Who needs to act?' -- explicitly: 'Waiting on host' or 'Your action needed' or 'Split Lease processing.' Add estimated timeframes to each waiting state: 'Hosts typically respond within 48 hours.' When the host counters, the pipeline updates to show the guest what changed and what they need to decide, with the counter-offer terms visible directly in the pipeline context, not on a separate page. The pattern is: resolve uncertainty at every moment, even if the resolution is 'nothing has changed yet -- expected response by [date].'",

Bryant describes the core matching challenge: 'Monday to Friday is a very popular usage pattern... so there can be some difficulties there in matching with your listing availability' (10:17-10:27). The guest who needs Monday-Thursday nights first needs to know: does this listing have those nights available? At what cost for my specific pattern? For how long?

The CTA changes from 'Submit Proposal' to 'View Listing' if the schedule fit is partial, and 'Submit Proposal' if the schedule fit is complete.

The result is predictable: early reviews are completed, late reviews are skipped or perfunctory (5 stars, no text). The per-stay review model treats each week as equally important, but the guest's capacity for administrative tasks degrades over the lease duration.

This captures the settled-in experience. (3) After the final stay: 'Your lease at [property] has ended. How was the overall experience?' This captures the complete picture. Each review moment presents pre-filled context (the weeks covered, the property, the host) and asks for a single overall rating plus one text field.
