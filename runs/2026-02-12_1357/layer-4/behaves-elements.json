      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The guest returns to the Stays Manager weekly for 13+ weeks. Each visit is a micro-interaction: check current status, see if anything needs attention, leave. But the current flat table of stays forces the guest to re-orient on every visit -- scanning past completed rows to locate the current week. Kahneman's skill acquisition research shows that repeated tasks should become automatic through System 1 learning, but a table where the current row shifts downward each week defeats spatial memory. The guest's System 1 never develops a stable 'look here' pattern because the target moves. Every Monday morning, when the hybrid worker checks before heading to the property, they face a System 2 scan task on a page that should be a System 1 glance. The interaction pattern must make the 13th visit as effortless as the 3rd -- not harder because 12 completed rows now precede the current one.",
      "solution": "On every page load, the Stays Manager auto-focuses the hero card for the current or next actionable stay at a fixed screen position (top of content area, never scrolled below the fold). The hero card animates in with a subtle entrance that confirms freshness ('this is new since your last visit') while maintaining positional consistency ('this is always where you look'). Completed stays collapse automatically below the hero card into a muted summary. Future stays collapse into a count. The page remembers the guest's last interaction state: if they expanded the full table last visit, it loads expanded again; otherwise it loads in hero-card mode. On return visits, if the status has changed since last visit (a stay moved from In Progress to Completed, a review became available), the hero card shows a brief change indicator -- a dot or subtle highlight that fades after 2 seconds -- so the guest knows something is different without reading the card. This change indicator is the key interaction distinction between 'first visit of the week' and 'return visit same week': the indicator only appears when something has changed.",

The interaction pattern for date changes must compete with the speed and simplicity of a text message: 'Hey, can I switch Thursday for Tuesday?' takes about 10 seconds to type. Any platform flow that exceeds this cognitive and temporal cost will lose to texting. The current Date Change section presents a 'Request Changes' button that leads to a form with change types, pricing rules, and a submission process -- a multi-step System 2 workflow that a depleted hybrid worker will abandon in favor of a 10-second text. Kahneman's law of least effort predicts that the guest will always choose the path requiring the least cognitive investment. If that path is texting, the platform never captures the interaction, cannot enforce pricing rules, and loses visibility into the guest's schedule behavior.",
      "solution": "Embed the date change initiation directly within each stay row (or the hero card) so the guest never leaves the Stays Manager. The interaction is three taps: (1) Tap the specific stay or a 'Change' affordance on the hero card. A bottom sheet or inline expansion opens, showing the three change types (Swap, Add, Remove) as tappable cards with financial consequences pre-computed and visible. (2) Tap the desired change type. The view updates to show available alternative dates (pulled from synced host availability in real time), each with its cost delta. Unavailable dates are not shown at all -- the guest never selects a date that will be rejected. (3) Tap the desired date and confirm. The request is submitted, the host is notified, and the stay row updates to show 'Change pending' status. Total interaction time target: under 30 seconds. The key interaction principle: the change flow is contextual (it knows which stay the guest is changing), pre-computed (financial consequences are calculated before the guest sees options), and constrained (only available dates are shown). This eliminates the three System 2 tasks that make forms slow: identifying what to change, computing the cost, and guessing which dates will work.",

      "problem": "At every financial decision point -- selecting nights on a listing, configuring a proposal, requesting a date change -- the guest must understand the cost impact of their action before they commit. Currently, the listing page recalculates pricing dynamically when the guest changes inputs (days selected, duration, move-in date), but the recalculation produces three numbers (nightly rate, 4-week rent, total) at equal visual weight, forcing System 2 arithmetic. During date changes, the pricing section uses abstract labels ('fair market rate calculation') rather than computed dollar amounts. Kahneman's bat-and-ball research demonstrates that over 50% of elite university students fail simple arithmetic under cognitive ease. When the platform requires the guest to mentally translate nightly rates into monthly budgets, or to infer the cost of a date swap from a pricing policy description, the error rate is unacceptable and the cognitive drain prevents confident decision-making. The interaction pattern must ensure that every action with a financial consequence shows the consequence inline and pre-computed before the guest confirms.",
      "solution": "Implement a universal 'preview before commit' interaction pattern at every financial touchpoint. The pattern works the same everywhere: (1) The guest takes an action that has financial implications (selects a night, changes a duration, picks a replacement date). (2) Within 200ms, a financial consequence preview appears inline -- adjacent to the action, not in a separate summary area. The preview shows one number: the delta from the current state ('+$0,' '+$15/night,' '-$80 refund'). (3) Only after seeing the preview can the guest confirm. The confirm action is not available until the preview has rendered. This prevents accidental commits before cost is understood. Implementation specifics: On the listing page, each day-of-week toggle shows its cost contribution inline when toggled ('+ $301/night' appears next to the toggled day). On the proposal configuration, changing duration shows the total delta ('Adding 2 weeks: +$2,408'). In date changes, each available date chip shows its cost difference from the original date. The pattern is: the financial preview is attached to the interaction element, not displayed in a separate summary section. The guest never has to look away from where they are acting to see what their action costs.",

Brad's behavior confirms this pattern -- he resorts to texting Nneka directly because the platform provides no status channel. The proposal pipeline currently shows stage names and completion status but not who acts next or how long to wait.

Kahneman's ego depletion research shows that monitoring tasks -- even low-effort ones -- draw from the same depleted pool as the guest's work responsibilities. A payment table that requires verification on every visit is a low-grade cognitive tax that accumulates over the lease.

If a payment failed or is overdue, the summary bar changes color (amber for upcoming/warning, red for failed/overdue) and shows the issue: 'Payment of $1,460 due Nov 26 -- card declined. [Update payment method].' The detailed table exists below the summary bar for guests who want to verify individual payments, but the summary bar answers the three questions the guest actually has: (1) Am I on track? (2) What is next? (3) Is anything wrong? These three answers are visible without scrolling and without reading any table rows. The interaction pattern for the summary bar is entirely passive: it updates automatically when payments process, requires no guest interaction, and changes color only when attention is needed. On weekly visits where everything is on track, the guest glances at the green progress bar and moves on.

When the guest taps a notification and the deep-linked content loads, the destination page loads with a highlighted state on the relevant element (a brief golden outline or background flash that fades after 2 seconds) so the guest immediately sees what changed.",
        "empty": "If the guest opens a notification center or in-app notification list and has no notifications: 'All caught up. We will notify you when something needs your attention.' This is an affirmative empty state, not a void.",
        "error": "If a notification deep-link fails (the referenced proposal was withdrawn, the payment was reversed): the destination page shows the current state with a note: 'This notification referred to [event] which has since been updated. Here is the current status.' No broken link dead-end.",
        "success": "Notification tapped and action completed (e.g., guest accepts counter-offer from notification): the notification is marked as resolved, and a brief inline confirmation replaces the notification content: 'Done -- counter-offer accepted.' The notification list shows a checkmark on resolved items."

      "transition_principle": "Notifications arrive silently during non-active use (the guest's phone vibrates or shows a standard push notification). When the guest returns to the app from a notification, the transition to the deep-linked content uses a special entrance animation: the relevant element (a proposal stage, a stay row, a payment summary) briefly highlights with a warm glow (accent-light background that fades over 2 seconds) to guide the eye directly to what changed. This highlight is the only animation -- the rest of the page loads normally. The highlight answers the question 'what is different since my last visit?' without requiring the guest to scan the entire page.",
      "timing": {
        "response_target": "Push notification delivery: within 60 seconds of status change. Deep-link page load: under 1 second. Highlight animation on relevant element: 2 second fade from accent-light (#e8f0eb) to transparent.",

        "rationale": "The 2-second highlight fade using out easing provides a gentle, warm indication of change that does not feel like an alarm. The accent-light green (#e8f0eb) from tokens.json is chosen because it is the platform's trust color, signaling 'something good happened here' rather than 'danger.' The 60-second notification delivery window balances real-time urgency with infrastructure practicality."

      "journey_state_awareness": "During negotiation: notifications are frequent and high-priority (host responded, counter-offer received, proposal accepted). The guest expects these and the notification system delivers them within 60 seconds. During active_lease: notifications are infrequent and routine (payment processed, review milestone, date change resolved). The guest has settled into a weekly rhythm and notifications serve as gentle supplements, not primary drivers. Post-lease: notifications reduce to zero except for final review prompt and deposit return status. The notification cadence mirrors the emotional intensity of each journey phase.",
      "edge_cases": [
        "Guest has notifications disabled at the OS level: the in-app notification center becomes the primary status channel. A subtle badge on the app icon (if supported) or an in-app banner on next visit communicates unread updates.",
        "Multiple status changes occur between guest visits (e.g., host countered, then withdrew counter, then re-countered): notifications are coalesced into the most recent state rather than showing a confusing sequence. The guest sees 'Host updated their offer' not three separate notifications.",
        "Guest receives a notification during a different app session (e.g., while in the Stays Manager): the notification appears as an in-app banner at the top of the screen that slides down (200ms, out easing) and auto-dismisses after 5 seconds unless tapped.",
        "Notification references a lease the guest is no longer active on (post-lease deposit return): the notification links to a post-lease summary view, not to the now-inactive Stays Manager."
