      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The Stays Manager is the guest's most-visited page -- weekly for 13+ weeks. The current design (per the guest journey document, lines 392-408) presents stays as a flat data table where every row has equal visual weight: same font size, same row height, same color treatment. Week 1 (completed two months ago) and Week 8 (the current stay) look identical. The guest's System 1 cannot instantly locate the current week because no visual signal differentiates it from the 12 other rows. Kahneman's research on cognitive ease shows that repeated tasks should become easier with practice, but a table where the target row shifts downward each week never develops the spatial consistency needed for System 1 recognition. The guest is forced into a System 2 scan on every single visit -- parsing row after row -- when they should be performing a System 1 glance at a fixed, visually prominent element.",
      "solution": "Create a clear visual hierarchy where the current/next stay occupies a hero card with dramatically different visual treatment from all other stays. The hero card uses a white surface (#ffffff / --bg-white) with an elevated shadow (--shadow-md) and the accent purple left border (--secondary-purple, 3px) to create a 'this is your focus' signal. It sits above the fold, always in the same position regardless of how many weeks have passed. Completed stays below collapse into a muted summary row using --bg-light (#f9fafb) with --text-light-gray for the count. Future stays use the same muted treatment. The status badge on the hero card uses color-coded backgrounds: In Progress = --secondary-purple with white text, Completed = --status-success-light with --status-success-text, Not Started = --bg-light-gray with --text-gray. The hero card is the only element at full visual intensity; everything else is visually receded. This creates a System 1 focal point: the eye lands on the hero card because it is the only high-contrast, elevated element on the page.",

All three numbers appear at comparable visual weight on the listing page. Kahneman's bat-and-ball research demonstrates that over 50% of elite university students fail simple arithmetic under cognitive ease conditions. When the guest sees three financial figures at equal visual prominence, their System 1 must choose which number to anchor on. Because System 1 gravitates to the first or largest number, it may anchor on the nightly rate (misleadingly low) or the total (alarmingly high) rather than the monthly equivalent they need. In the Stays Manager Payment Schedule, the same problem recurs: individual payment rows ($1,400 + $60 = $1,460) appear without cumulative context, forcing the guest to mentally track how much they have paid versus how much remains.",
      "solution": "At every financial touchpoint, establish a strict typographic hierarchy: one number at primary weight, supporting numbers at secondary weight, and breakdowns on demand. The primary financial figure uses Outfit 700 28px (--text-2xl, --font-weight-bold) in --text-dark. This is the monthly-equivalent cost. The supporting figure (nightly rate) uses Outfit 400 14px (--text-base, --font-weight-normal) in --text-gray, positioned directly below as a derivation note. The full breakdown is hidden behind an expand control using --text-sm in --text-light-gray. In the Payment Schedule, each row shows the period amount in --text-base, but a persistent summary bar at the top of the table shows 'Paid: $4,380 of $11,738' in --text-lg --font-weight-semibold, using a progress bar with --secondary-purple fill on --bg-light-gray track.

Adding nights: Guest pays host. Fair market rate calculation'). These are visually separated -- the types in one area, the pricing rules in another. The guest must cross-reference between the two sections, which is a System 2 table-lookup task. Kahneman's associative coherence research shows that System 1 creates stories by linking related information into a single unit. When type and cost are visually separated, System 1 cannot form a complete story ('I swap and pay nothing extra') because the cost information is in a different visual location than the type selection. Nneka's call confirms the real-world consequence: even Bryant had to explicitly ask whether replace and add have different pricing (07:22-07:45). If the Split Lease team needs clarification, the guest certainly cannot parse it from separated abstract labels.",

When the guest encounters a rate change at the Date Change screen, it arrives as text ('fair market rate calculation') without a visual comparison to the anchored price. This forces System 2 to recall the original rate, compare it to the new rate, compute the difference, and judge fairness -- four operations on a depleted user who just wants to swap a Tuesday for a Wednesday. The Muller-Lyer illusion principle from Kahneman is relevant: even after knowing the rates are fair, the guest will feel the increase is unfair because their System 1 anchored on the lower number.

      "problem": "The guest's primary filter is schedule compatibility -- do the available nights at this listing match the nights I need? Bryant describes this as the core matching challenge: 'Monday to Friday is a very popular usage pattern... so there can be some difficulties there in matching with your listing availability' (10:17-10:27). Yet the current listing card hierarchy leads with property photos, followed by location, title, and two pricing displays. The guest must click into the listing detail page to discover whether their Monday-Thursday pattern aligns with the host's available nights. This means every incompatible listing the guest evaluates wastes attention from Kahneman's limited attention budget. The visual design of listing cards prioritizes the information that matters least (photos of a space you may never be able to use) over the information that matters most (can you actually use this space on your days).",
      "solution": "Add a compact day-of-week compatibility strip as the first information element on each listing card, positioned above the photo. The strip shows S M T W T F S as small circular indicators (similar to the existing day-badge pattern in the style guide, but at --icon-xs / 16px size). Available days matching the guest's selected pattern use --secondary-purple background with white text. Available days not in the guest's pattern use --bg-light-gray with --text-light-gray. Unavailable days use a strikethrough or X mark in --text-light-gray on transparent background. The strip also shows a compact compatibility percentage or label: 'Full match' in --status-success-text or '3 of 4 nights' in --status-warning-text. This strip is 24px tall and adds minimal visual overhead, but it converts the card from 'look at this property' to 'this property works for your schedule.'

The current design shows stage names and completion status as a horizontal timeline with filled and unfilled dots or segments. This tells the guest where they are in the sequence but not who acts next or how long to wait. After submitting a proposal, the guest enters an anxiety-producing waiting state with no visual indicator of whether the host has seen it.

When nothing visibly changes, System 2 remains activated to monitor the uncertainty, creating persistent cognitive drain that competes with the hybrid worker's job responsibilities.",

The guest journey document describes it as tracking 'accommodation willingness' and notes it 'may affect future bookings.' From the guest's perspective, a bare percentage creates two problems: (1) If the score is high, the number is meaningless because the guest does not know what 100% means or what a 'good' score is. (2) If the score is low, it feels like a guilt mechanism discouraging the guest from requesting changes. Kahneman's concept of System 1 pattern recognition means a percentage displayed prominently will be interpreted emotionally before it is understood rationally. A '72%' displayed in large purple text might feel like a failing grade to a guest primed by school experiences, even if 72% is excellent for flexibility. The visual treatment of the Flexibility Score determines whether it builds trust ('my host is flexible') or creates anxiety ('I am using up my flexibility budget').",

Present it as a small, inline element within the Date Change section, not as a featured metric.
