      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "The Stays Manager is the most-visited page in the guest journey -- 13+ visits over a single lease. On Week 1, the guest arrives uncertain: they do not yet know whether the platform is reliable, whether their stay information is accurate, or whether anything will go wrong. Their System 2 is fully engaged in parsing a new interface. By Week 7, the guest has developed expectations but also accumulated fatigue from weekly administrative prompts (reviews, photo uploads). By Week 13, the guest is either comfortably habituated or resentfully checked-out. The emotional arc of the Stays Manager determines whether the guest renews, recommends, or abandons. Currently, the flat table design delivers the same emotional experience on Week 1 and Week 13: a wall of data rows that demands System 2 scanning. There is no emotional progression. The page does not reward the guest for returning, does not acknowledge their growing familiarity, and does not adapt its tone to the stage of the relationship. Kahneman's skill acquisition research shows that repeated tasks should feel easier with practice -- but a table that grows each week makes the experience harder, not easier, creating an emotional trajectory of increasing frustration rather than increasing comfort.",
      "solution": "Design the Stays Manager's emotional arc across three distinct phases. Week 1-3 (Orientation): the tone is warm, gently instructional, and reassuring. The hero card includes a brief orientation note ('This card updates each week with your current stay'). Copy uses complete sentences. The feeling is 'we are guiding you.' Week 4-9 (Routine): the tone shifts to efficient and confident. Orientation hints disappear. Copy becomes terse and data-forward. The feeling is 'you know how this works; here is what you need.' Week 10-13 (Appreciation): the tone shifts to reflective and grateful. The hero card acknowledges the approaching end ('3 weeks remaining'). The final review prompt is framed warmly. The feeling is 'thank you for being here.' The emotional arc maps to Kahneman's cognitive ease gradient: Week 1 requires System 2 (unfamiliar interface), so the emotional design compensates with warmth. By Week 7, System 1 handles the page (familiar pattern), so the emotional design steps back to efficiency. By Week 13, the relationship deserves acknowledgment, so the design re-engages with human warmth.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation", "negotiation", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Nneka states that rescheduling at the original rate is 'not working financially' because seasonal pricing has increased from $1,170-$1,175 to a higher rate. Brad anchored on the original price -- it was the first financial number he evaluated, and Kahneman's anchoring research shows that first numbers become the reference point against which all subsequent numbers are judged. When Brad encounters a higher rate during rescheduling, the emotional experience is not 'the market price changed' but 'I was promised one price and now they want more.' This is the betrayal emotion -- the most destructive feeling in a platform relationship. Betrayal is not caused by the price increase itself; it is caused by the gap between what the guest expected and what they encountered. The platform currently makes no effort to close this gap before it opens. The listing page shows one nightly rate. The proposal confirms one total. The rescheduling section uses abstract labels ('fair market rate calculation') instead of concrete numbers. At every stage, the emotional setup is 'your price is fixed' and the emotional payoff is 'your price changed.' This sequence manufactures betrayal.",
      "solution": "Prevent the betrayal emotion by eliminating the expectation gap before commitment. At listing evaluation, when dates span pricing seasons, show the rate range ('$280-$301/night depending on season') so the guest's anchor is a range, not a single number. At proposal confirmation, include a one-line seasonal note ('Date changes are priced at the rate for the new dates'). At every date change in the Stays Manager, show the original rate next to the new rate with the delta. The emotional principle is: prepare the guest for variability before they experience it. A guest who was told 'rates vary by season' and then sees a seasonal adjustment feels informed. A guest who was shown one rate and then sees a different rate feels deceived. The emotional architecture is identical to Kahneman's Muller-Lyer illusion: you cannot change the feeling (the higher rate will always feel worse than the original), but you can prevent the surprise that amplifies the feeling into betrayal.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_creation", "negotiation", "acceptance"],
      "problem": "After submitting a proposal, the guest enters an emotionally vulnerable state: they have committed to wanting a place to stay, but they do not know if they will get it. Kahneman describes how System 2 is activated when 'an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains.' The guest's model after submission is 'I acted, something should happen.' When the platform shows no change -- no acknowledgment, no timeline, no indication that the host has seen the proposal -- System 2 stays activated in monitoring mode. This is not a one-time activation; it is a persistent, low-grade cognitive drain that competes with the guest's work responsibilities. Brad's behavior confirms this pattern: he texts Nneka directly because the platform provides no channel for resolving the uncertainty. The emotional cost of this opacity is not just anxiety -- it is helplessness. The guest cannot do anything to accelerate the process, cannot see whether progress is happening, and cannot plan their housing situation. Helplessness is the most disempowering emotion a platform can inflict, and it is entirely created by the absence of status information.",
      "solution": "Replace helplessness with informed patience. At every stage of the proposal pipeline, provide three pieces of emotional infrastructure: (1) Acknowledgment: 'Your proposal was received and sent to [host name].' This validates the guest's action. (2) Timeline: 'Hosts typically respond within 48 hours. Submitted 14 hours ago.' This converts open-ended uncertainty into bounded waiting. (3) Agency: 'If you do not hear back by [date], you can send a reminder or contact support.' This gives the guest a future action to hold onto, preventing the feeling that they are entirely at the mercy of the host. The emotional principle is: the guest can tolerate waiting if they know what they are waiting for, how long it should take, and what they can do if it takes too long. Open-ended, information-free waiting is emotionally intolerable. Bounded, transparent waiting is manageable.",

A text message feels personal, immediate, and low-commitment: 'Hey, can I switch Thursday for Tuesday?' takes 10 seconds and creates no formal record. The platform, by contrast, feels official, slow, and consequential: filling out a form, clicking submit, waiting for a system response. Kahneman's law of least effort predicts that the guest will always choose the cognitively easier path. But the emotional dimension is equally important: texting feels human and casual; the platform feels institutional and formal. The guest is not just choosing the easier path -- they are choosing the path that feels less like doing paperwork and more like talking to a person. This emotional preference for informality over formality is particularly strong for the target persona (hybrid workers managing demanding jobs) who spend their workdays in formal systems and crave informality in their personal logistics. The platform currently offers no emotional counterweight to this preference: it looks and feels like a management console, not a conversation.",
      "solution": "Design every guest-initiated interaction during active_lease to feel conversational rather than administrative. The date change flow should feel like sending a message, not filing a request. The copy should mirror the casual language of a text message: 'Swap Thu for Tue?' rather than 'Submit Date Change Request.' The response from the system should feel like a reply: 'Got it. Sent to Nneka. She usually responds within a day.' The emotional principle is: the platform must feel like a smarter version of the text thread, not a replacement for it. The guest should think 'I could text Nneka, but the platform is just as easy and keeps track of everything.' This means: (1) Input speed must match texting speed -- three taps, not three form fields. (2) Language must match texting casualness -- first names, short sentences, no jargon. (3) Feedback must match texting immediacy -- instant acknowledgment, not 'your request has been submitted.' (4) The emotional reward of using the platform must exceed texting: the guest sees available dates (no guessing), sees the cost impact (no surprises), and has a record (no 'did I already text her about Tuesday?').",

Each unreviewed stay is a small guilt signal: the platform is silently asking 'Why have you not reviewed Week 3 yet?' while the guest is just trying to check their current week status. Kahneman's ego depletion research shows that the guilt from unfinished tasks draws from the same System 2 pool as the tasks themselves -- meaning the guilt is cognitively depleting even when the guest does not act on it. The emotional trajectory is: Week 1-3, the guest dutifully reviews each stay. Week 4-6, reviews become perfunctory (5 stars, no text). Week 7+, the guest stops reviewing but sees the accumulating 'Review' buttons on every visit, creating a background hum of guilt that makes the Stays Manager feel like a nagging parent rather than a helpful dashboard. By Week 13, the guest's emotional association with the Stays Manager is 'the page that makes me feel behind' rather than 'the page that helps me manage my stay.' This emotional contamination damages the guest's entire relationship with the platform.",

When a batched review moment arrives, it appears as a warm invitation, not an obligation: 'You have been here 4 weeks. How is it going?' rather than 'Rate your stay for Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, and Week 4.' The emotional reframe is: reviewing is a moment of reflection offered at the right time, not an ongoing obligation imposed by the platform's data structure. The guest should feel 'Oh, time to reflect on how this is going' (pleasant) not 'Oh, I still have not reviewed five stays' (guilt).",

If the guest's first encounter with Split Lease primes 'flexible, easy housing,' then every friction point -- rescheduling complexity, pricing confusion, availability constraints -- contradicts the primed network and triggers cognitive dissonance. The Nneka call reveals exactly this disconnect: the platform promises flexibility, but Brad's actual experience of rescheduling involves texting the host, waiting for manual availability checks, and discovering that dates cost more than expected. The emotional damage is not caused by the friction itself -- every platform has friction. It is caused by the gap between what was promised at discovery and what is delivered during the lease. This is Kahneman's violation model: 'System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains.' The discovery touchpoint builds the model. The active lease tests it.",
      "solution": "Design discovery messaging that honestly prepares the guest for the reality of mid-term housing negotiation. Instead of promising 'easy flexibility,' promise 'transparent flexibility': 'Find mid-term housing with clear pricing, real-time availability, and a rescheduling tool that shows you exactly what changes cost before you commit.' This sets an expectation that is specific enough to be tested and honest enough to survive contact with reality. The emotional principle is: under-promise on ease, over-deliver on transparency. The guest who expects 'transparent flexibility' and encounters a rate comparison display feels the platform delivered on its promise. The guest who expects 'easy flexibility' and encounters any friction at all feels deceived. At search and listing evaluation, continue the honesty: show schedule compatibility upfront (not after the guest invests evaluation effort), show rate ranges when dates span seasons (not single misleading rates), and show 'proposal-based booking' clearly (not 'book now' language that implies instant booking). Every discovery touchpoint should set an expectation that the Stays Manager can fulfill 13 weeks later.",
