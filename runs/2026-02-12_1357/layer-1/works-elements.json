      "problem": "The guest's most frequent interaction with Split Lease during an active lease is managing schedule changes: replacing a night they cannot make, adding an extra night, or swapping dates. Currently, no self-service rescheduling tool exists (Bryant confirms at 00:32-01:02 that 'we've been working on this rescheduling tool'). Brad must text Nneka directly ('He was texting me and saying, Hey, you know, I can't make it for another day,' 01:23-01:42), Nneka must manually check her Airbnb calendar, and the Split Lease team mediates. This three-party process for a single date change forces the guest to context-switch from their work responsibilities (hybrid workers are the primary guest persona, per Bryant at 10:17-12:17) into a manual coordination task. Kahneman's law of least effort predicts that guests facing this friction will either stop rescheduling (leading to no-shows and wasted nights) or handle everything off-platform (text messages), where the platform loses visibility, cannot enforce pricing rules, and cannot protect either party. The Stays Manager UI (Guest Leases page) shows per-week stays with status badges and a Date Change section with Accept/Reject actions, but without a self-service initiation flow, the guest has no way to start a change request from inside the platform.",
      "solution": "Build the date change flow as a three-tap interaction that completes within the guest's existing Stays Manager visit: (1) Tap the specific week/stay row to open it. (2) Select the change type (replace night, add night, remove night) from clearly labeled options that show the pricing implication inline ('Replace: same rate,' 'Add: current market rate,' 'Remove: refund amount'). (3) See available alternative dates (pulled from synced host availability), pick one, and submit. The host receives a notification and accepts or counters. The entire guest-side flow should take under 60 seconds. The key design principle: the Date Change section in the Stays Manager must be the entry point, not a separate page or a message thread. The guest is already visiting this page weekly to check their stays. Meet them where they already are, at the cognitive speed of their existing visit pattern.",

      "problem": "The guest journey currently treats all date changes as a single category, but the Nneka call reveals that 'replace' and 'add' have fundamentally different pricing implications. Bryant asks: 'If Brad was to add a book tonight, and add instead of like replace, is that something you would be open to?' and Nneka responds that additions would be at a 'different rate' (07:22-07:45). Nneka also states that replacing dates at the old rate is 'not working financially' due to seasonal pricing changes (03:33-04:26). This means: (a) replacing dates may trigger a price adjustment if the new dates fall in a different pricing season, (b) adding dates is always at the current market rate, and (c) removing dates triggers a refund calculation. The guest currently has no way to understand these distinctions before acting. Kahneman's research on System 1 associative coherence shows that the mind does not automatically distinguish between similar-seeming actions with different consequences. A guest who thinks 'change my dates' is performing one simple mental operation; the platform must not force them to perform three separate cognitive evaluations to understand the financial implications of replace vs. add vs. remove.",
      "solution": "When the guest initiates a date change, present the three options (Replace, Add, Remove) as a single choice screen where each option shows its financial consequence in one number: (1) Replace: 'Swap Oct 15 for Oct 22. Price difference: +$0' or '+$12 (seasonal adjustment).' (2) Add: 'Add Oct 22. Cost: $85 (current rate).' (3) Remove: 'Remove Oct 15. Refund: $73.' The guest selects one option and sees the specific financial impact before confirming. No mental arithmetic. No ambiguity about which action costs money and which saves money. The Flexibility Score (already in the Date Change section of the Stays Manager) should be visible but not positioned as a guilt mechanism; it should explain what it means ('Your host has accommodated 4 of 5 change requests') rather than just showing a percentage.",

      "problem": "The Guest Leases page / Stays Manager is the most frequently visited part of the platform for active guests. A guest with a 13-week lease visits this page at least 13 times -- likely more, since they also check payment status, review completed stays, upload photos, and manage date changes. The current Stays Manager design (as described in the guest journey document) presents a data table with columns for Week #, Period, Status, and Actions. This is a System 2 interface: it requires the guest to scan rows, identify the current week, determine its status, and select the appropriate action. Each weekly visit forces the guest to re-orient in a table of 13+ rows. Kahneman's research on cognitive ease shows that 'as you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes.' But a table that grows with each passing week does not become easier -- it becomes harder, because the completed weeks accumulate visual noise that the guest must filter past to find the current week. The weekly visit should be a System 1 glance ('everything is fine, nothing needs my attention') not a System 2 scan ('let me find my current week in this table and figure out what to do').",

[Leave Review] [Upload Photos].' (2) A collapsed summary of past weeks: '6 stays completed. All reviewed.' Expandable on demand. (3) A compact preview of upcoming weeks: '6 weeks remaining. Next: Week 8, Oct 21-25.' (4) A notification-style alert area for any pending date changes, payment issues, or host messages. The page loads with the answer to the guest's primary question: 'What do I need to do right now?' This is a System 1 assessment (glance at a single card) rather than a System 2 scan (parse a 13-row table).

When the host-guest relationship operates through text messages, the platform becomes invisible during the most active phase of the journey. This creates three compounding failures: (a) No enforcement of pricing rules -- Nneka is absorbing rescheduling costs at old rates because there is no system to calculate and present the fair price adjustment. (b) No record of agreements -- if Brad and Nneka disagree about what was agreed via text, neither party has platform-backed evidence. (c) No data for Split Lease -- the platform cannot learn from, optimize, or even observe the most critical interactions in the guest journey. Kahneman's priming research predicts that once the guest is primed to use text messages for coordination ('this is how I talk to my host'), they will continue using text messages even after an in-app tool exists.

(2) When the host responds to a change request, the guest receives a push notification with the decision, not a text message. The notification links directly to the updated Stays Manager. (3) For unstructured communication (questions about the space, logistics), provide a simple messaging interface within the Guest Leases page. Keep it adjacent to the stays and date change sections so context is always visible. (4) For the transition period: when a guest or host initiates contact off-platform (detected by the absence of in-platform activity paired with a schedule change), the platform should prompt: 'It looks like your stay dates changed. Want to log this change so your payment schedule stays accurate?' This bridges off-platform behavior back to the platform without punishing the user.",

Brad likely anchored on his original rate and will experience any increase as a loss. Kahneman's research on anchoring and loss aversion predicts that the original price becomes the guest's reference point; deviations upward feel like overcharges even when they reflect legitimate market changes. This creates a trust erosion pattern: the guest agrees to one price, discovers mid-lease that rescheduling or extending triggers a different price, and interprets the difference as unfair or deceptive. The Guest Leases page shows a Payment Schedule with fixed amounts ($1,400 + $60 maintenance = $1,460 per period), but the Date Change section uses 'fair market rate calculation' and 'price adjustment' without explaining how these relate to the original rate. The gap between the anchored price and the adjustment price is where trust breaks down.",

      "problem": "The Stays Manager asks the guest to perform multiple administrative actions per stay: Review the stay (rate cleanliness, accuracy, communication, write text), Upload Photos (document property condition), and Report Issues. Over a 13-week lease, this is potentially 39 separate prompts. Each prompt is a System 2 task: the guest must recall the specific stay, evaluate their experience, compose a rating or description, and submit. Kahneman's ego depletion research shows that sequential self-control tasks drain from a shared pool. A hybrid worker returning from a long workday to the Stays Manager faces administrative tasks that compete with the same depleted System 2 resources they used for work. The result is predictable: guests complete reviews for the first few weeks, then compliance drops as depletion accumulates. The per-stay review process treats each week as equally important, but the guest's cognitive capacity for administrative tasks degrades over the lease duration -- precisely when their feedback about the long-term living experience becomes most valuable.",
      "solution": "Batch administrative tasks to match the guest's natural energy rhythms rather than the platform's per-week data structure: (1) Instead of prompting for a review after every stay, batch reviews at natural intervals: after Week 4 (end of first payment cycle), at the midpoint of the lease, and after the final stay. Three thoughtful reviews are more valuable than 13 perfunctory ones. (2) Photo uploads should be prompted once at move-in (document initial condition) and once at move-out (document final condition), not weekly. Mid-lease photos are optional and available on demand but never prompted. (3) Issue reporting is the exception: this must be available immediately and prominently at any time, because issues are time-sensitive. But the 'Report Issue' button should be a persistent element, not a per-stay action buried in a table row. (4) Each batched review moment should take no more than 2 minutes and should present pre-filled context: 'Your stay over the past 4 weeks covered Oct 1-25, across 4 weeks. How was it?' This eliminates the recall burden of week-by-week evaluation.",

If I worked, then it automatically updates on' (05:06-05:44). Bryant asks about screenshots of availability as a workaround (05:27). The guest has no visibility into this dependency. When Brad requests a reschedule, his success depends on Nneka's Airbnb calendar -- a system he cannot see and may not know exists. This creates a pattern of opaque rejection: the guest requests a date, the host says no (because Airbnb shows the date as booked), and the guest experiences this as arbitrary hostility rather than a factual constraint. During search and listing evaluation, the same problem manifests differently: the guest sees a listing that appears available, but the actual available dates are a subset constrained by the host's cross-platform bookings. Kahneman's violation model predicts that when 'an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains,' the guest's trust is damaged. The guest's model is: 'if the listing is on Split Lease, the dates are available on Split Lease.' The reality violates this model.",
      "solution": "Integrate host availability into every guest-facing decision point where dates matter: (1) In search results, show only dates that are actually available (synced from the host's calendar, including Airbnb). Never show a listing as available for dates that are blocked on the host's external calendar. (2) On the listing evaluation page, the day-of-week selector should gray out unavailable dates rather than allowing the guest to select them and discover unavailability later. (3) In the Stays Manager Date Change flow, show available dates inline so the guest never requests a date that will be rejected. 'Available dates this week: Mon, Tue, Wed (Thu-Fri booked).' (4) When availability changes after a guest has submitted a proposal or change request, notify the guest immediately rather than letting the request sit in limbo.
