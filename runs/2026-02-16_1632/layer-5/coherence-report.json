It states: 'Per-stay review buttons on every completed row create an accumulating to-do list that the guest ignores.' rb-ui-001 (Stay-Cycle Micro-Review Pulse) prescribes exactly the opposite: a review prompt after every single weekly stay, for a total of 13+ prompts per lease. The theoretical basis also conflicts: guest-communicates-007 uses Kahneman's ego depletion ('by Week 5, the guest's System 2 has been depleted by four prior reviews') while rb-ui-001 uses Eyal's Habit Zone ('13+ weekly reviews push the behavior past the frequency threshold for habit formation').",

Eyal's Habit Zone research (reverse-benchmark) predicts that behaviors must occur frequently enough to become habitual, and 3 reviews per lease is below any reasonable frequency threshold. The critical difference is the FRICTION of the action: guest-communicates-007 assumed the review format would be the traditional multi-dimension form (Cleanliness, Accuracy, Communication + optional text), which IS depleting. rb-ui-001 specifies a radically simpler action: one tap from three options (Great/Fine/Rough) with an optional 140-character note -- fundamentally different from a 3-dimension rating plus text composition.

The batched deep review at 3 reflection points becomes the rb-ui-007 synthesis modal, which USES the accumulated micro-pulse data rather than asking the guest to generate new data from scratch.

Focus on how guests make the high-commitment decision to propose on a 3-month lease based on listing information, photos, and reviews.",
      "reason": "The coverage map shows 'evaluation' is covered primarily by design-stack host-side elements. The reverse-benchmark identified 10 major trust-related disappointments in the listing evaluation phase, but no design-stack run has examined this from the guest's perspective. The temporal review timeline (rb-ui-002) and vetting trust shield (rb-ui-003) are reverse-benchmark solutions that need design-stack validation against real guest evaluation behavior."
    },
    {
      "process_type": "reverse-benchmark",
      "recommendation": "Run a reverse-benchmark analysis on Zillow Rentals or Furnished Finder, using a retention/loyalty book (e.g., 'Hooked' revisited with focus on Ch. 5 Investment, or 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear). Focus specifically on the lease renewal and re-listing decision -- the moment when the guest decides whether to extend and the host decides whether to re-list.",
      "reason": "The coverage map shows 'retention' has only thin coverage from both processes. The reviewer reputation engine (rb-ui-005) is the only reverse-benchmark element addressing retention, and it has moderate confidence. A dedicated retention-focused run would validate whether reputation systems, review impact visibility, and behavioral metrics actually influence renewal decisions, or whether retention is driven by entirely different factors (price, convenience, host relationship) that the current library does not address."
    },
    {
      "process_type": "design-stack",
      "recommendation": "Run a design-stack analysis specifically on the onboarding-to-first-listing flow, using a guest transcript from someone completing their first booking (not evaluation -- execution). Focus on the moment between 'I decided to book' and 'I have confirmed my first stay.'",
      "reason": "Onboarding has thin coverage with zero reverse-benchmark elements. The trust desert (disappoint-010) and the wasted booking moment (disappoint-006) both implicate the onboarding/first-booking experience, but no run has examined what happens between a guest's decision to commit and their first actual stay. This is where rb-ui-004 (Priority Picker) would fire -- validating that element requires understanding the actual onboarding flow."
