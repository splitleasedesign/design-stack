  "crossref_summary": "Across 68 transcripts (48 host, 20 guest), the dominant trust pattern is personal vetting and human proof-of-legitimacy, not platform reviews. Hosts ask 'How do I know you're legit?' (Tag, Michael Spear, Patricia, Jessica Filomeno) and resolve it through LinkedIn profiles, success stories, sample contracts, and the agent's personal credibility -- never through a review system. Guests demand to 'see the space' and 'make sure everything is legit' (Susan Bryant) before committing. Hosts who have Airbnb reviews wield them as marketing weapons (Ramsey's 4.99 rating with 76 reviews), and Bryant proactively offers to port those reviews to Split Lease listings. The transcripts reveal a trust ecosystem built entirely on human intermediation and personal reputation signals, with zero infrastructure for post-stay review capture, mid-stay feedback, reviewer identity, or review-to-retention loops. Every Layer 1 disappointment is validated: the review system these users need does not exist in any form -- not broken, but absent. The most striking finding is that hosts already perform reviewer-like behavior (Tammy vets guests by employer/work location/purpose; Lilly demands proof of employment and landlord references) but this vetting intelligence is never captured as review-equivalent data for future guests or hosts.",
