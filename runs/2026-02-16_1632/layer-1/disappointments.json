  "disappointment_summary": "Booking.com's review system is an extraction machine wearing the costume of a feedback loop. It works -- nobody files tickets about it -- but it systematically fails at every phase of Eyal's Hook Model for the reviewer. The trigger is a single post-checkout email that arrives after emotional intensity has faded. The action demands that a long-term guest compress 90+ days of multidimensional experience into a seven-subcategory tax form. The reward is a void: no social recognition, no impact visibility, no tangible return. The investment is zero: no reviewer profile accumulates, no reputation builds, no stored value makes the next review more likely. The result is a system optimized entirely for review consumption (which is excellent) while treating review production as a disposable act of civic duty. For long-term shared housing, where review volume is structurally low and each review carries disproportionate weight, this asymmetry is not a minor gap -- it is the central design failure that no competitor has addressed.",

All fields are visible simultaneously. There is no progressive disclosure, no conditional depth based on stay length, no conversational scaffolding.

Your decision should be informed by what other guests experienced.' The implicit promise is reciprocity -- this system works because guests like you contributed. But the experience of being a contributor is the opposite of what consumption suggests. The reader sees a polished, powerful system.

This is a classic free-rider problem that Eyal's Variable Reward chapter (Ch. 4) predicts: when the reward for production is zero but the reward for consumption is high, production collapses to the minimum civic-duty baseline.
