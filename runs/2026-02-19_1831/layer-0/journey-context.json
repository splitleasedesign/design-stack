      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Discovery is the moment before any flow channel exists. The guest has no skills on the platform and no understanding of the challenge structure. Csikszentmihalyi's framework requires that flow activities 'have rules that require the learning of skills, they set up goals, they provide feedback, they make control possible.' At discovery, the guest has none of these. The user stories document focuses on value-before-the-ask ('Any flow that requires users to give information before seeing results will lose most of them'), which maps directly to the Flow prerequisite that the activity must be distinct from the anxiety of everyday chaos — the guest must perceive an ordered, inviting system before investing psychic energy. The existing library has 58 elements covering discovery, suggesting moderate coverage. The Flow lens adds a specific insight: discovery must not just attract attention but must establish the rule structure of the platform — what the guest can do, what outcomes are possible, what feedback they will receive — so that the guest's first interaction already has the conditions for a micro-flow experience.",

The user stories identify a key enabler: 'the proposal form should pre-populate with listing details so that I don't have to re-enter what the host already knows.' Through the Flow lens, pre-population is not just a convenience — it is challenge calibration. A blank form presents a challenge far above the guest's skill level (they may not know the nightly rate, total cost, or correct date format).

The platform's challenge is to extend its flow structure into the physical move-in experience. The journey map identifies key move-in interactions: House Manual (rules, guidelines, check-in procedures), arrival notifications, and messaging. The user stories document does not address move-in directly. The library has only 25 elements for move-in — the weakest coverage of any phase — which is a significant gap.

The guest visits the Leases/Stays Manager page weekly — 13+ times for a 3-month lease. This is the highest-frequency touchpoint in the entire journey and therefore the highest-frequency flow opportunity. Csikszentmihalyi's central insight applies directly: 'One cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long. We grow either bored or frustrated.' A Stays Manager that shows the same static information on visit 1 and visit 13 will push the guest to boredom (A2). But a Stays Manager that evolves — surfacing new challenges (upcoming date changes, review prompts, payment milestones, stay quality signals) — creates the conditions for sustained flow across the entire lease. The user stories document addresses active lease indirectly through the cross-activation insight about reviews: 'Every review is a past guest activating a future one.' Reviews are a flow activity — they require the skill of articulating experience, they provide the feedback of contributing to the community, and they offer the challenge of reflecting honestly. The library has 126 elements in active_lease — the strongest coverage — validating that this phase is recognized as critical.

User stories identify this at the search-to-evaluation boundary: 'Even if a user loves what they see on the card, they will still open the listing before committing — to check host reviews, credibility, full photos. The jump from card to proposal skips steps people naturally need.'

But there is no indication that the interface changes between visit 1 and visit 13. The guest's skill grows (they understand the system better with each visit) but the challenge remains static (same layout, same actions). This guarantees boredom by mid-lease. The Shushwap analogy from Flow Ch 4 is instructive: 'at times the world became too predictable and the challenge began to go out of life.'
