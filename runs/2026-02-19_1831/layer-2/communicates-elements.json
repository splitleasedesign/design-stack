      "problem": "The guest's information-processing skill grows across the pre-commitment journey, but the platform reveals information at a fixed depth. Discovery, search, and listing evaluation all present roughly the same density of content regardless of how much the guest has already absorbed. Csikszentmihalyi's A1-to-A4 progression demands that information complexity escalate alongside growing skill. A first-time visitor seeing the same depth of listing data as a returning power-searcher creates two simultaneous failures: the newcomer is overwhelmed (anxiety, A3) and the experienced guest is bored (A2). The user stories confirm this at the search level: 'The current card works but it's leaving engagement on the table. Richer hover states, image counters, availability indicators, neighborhood labels, and quick actions -- all without leaving the search grid.' This is a request for information layers that match the guest's increasing readiness to absorb them.",
      "solution": "Structure information in three escalating tiers that the guest unlocks through progressive engagement. Tier 1 (discovery/first search): show only the primary decision variables -- photo, price, location, availability signal. No secondary data. The goal is to establish that this is an ordered, goal-directed system worth entering, matching the Flow prerequisite that activities must be 'distinct from the paramount reality of everyday existence.' Tier 2 (engaged search/hover): surface richer card data on interaction -- neighborhood name, transit proximity, image count, availability indicator, host response time. These appear only when the guest demonstrates engagement (hover, scroll pause, return visit). Tier 3 (listing evaluation): reveal the full information set -- host credibility, reviews, house rules, detailed pricing, neighborhood narrative. This tier corresponds to the guest's highest pre-commitment skill level and matches their readiness for the challenge of evaluating whether to propose. Each tier should feel like discovery, not like loading a new page.",

      "problem": "Flow requires continuous feedback -- 'clear clues as to how well one is performing' -- but the guest journey's information architecture provides feedback only as post-action summaries. The search map is static (no response to exploration). The proposal form shows a price summary only after all fields are completed. Negotiation provides no signal during the waiting period between submission and counter-offer. The Stays Manager presents the same dashboard regardless of what has changed since last visit. In each case, the guest performs an action but the information architecture does not respond until the action is complete. Csikszentmihalyi identifies this absence of mid-action feedback as a flow-destroyer: without knowing how they are performing, the guest cannot calibrate their next action, leading to either anxiety (am I doing this right?) or disengagement (nothing responds to what I do).",
      "solution": "Add a dedicated feedback information layer to every action sequence that provides status signals during the action, not only after completion. For search: the map must surface contextual data as the guest explores -- hovering over a neighborhood reveals price range, transit access, and listing density. Panning should load results incrementally with visible loading signals. Filter changes should animate card transitions so cause-and-effect is visible. For proposal creation: as the guest selects dates, show real-time price calculation. As they complete fields, show a proposal completeness indicator. Before submission, show a preview that reads as a coherent document. For negotiation: after proposal submission, show host-viewed timestamp, estimated response time based on historical data, and any counter-offer in progress signal. For the Stays Manager: on each visit, surface a 'what changed since your last visit' summary at the top -- new messages, upcoming stay details, review prompts, payment confirmations.

The user stories identify that 'a skeptical guest who sees verified reviews, ID checks, and real host history doesn't need the platform to convince them -- another user already did.' But trust information is currently concentrated at listing evaluation (reviews, host profile) and absent from earlier phases where the guest makes equally critical trust-dependent decisions: Should I search here? (discovery). Should I click this card? (search). Should I message this host? (listing evaluation). Should I commit money? (proposal). Csikszentmihalyi's autotelic family framework identifies 'commitment' -- the trust that allows unselfconscious involvement -- as one of five conditions for flow. Without trust signals at each gate, the guest remains in a defensive, self-conscious mode that prevents flow entry. The Flow lens also reveals that anomie (unclear rules) and alienation (constrained action) are the social obstacles to flow -- both are activated when trust signals are absent because the guest cannot determine whether the system's rules are legitimate.",
      "solution": "Distribute trust information across all pre-commitment phases, calibrated to each phase's decision gate. At discovery: platform-level trust signals (total guests served, average satisfaction, security certifications, press mentions).

These are glanceable trust signals that help the guest decide which cards deserve deeper evaluation. At listing evaluation: full trust portfolio -- verified reviews with dates, host response history, ID verification status, payment guarantee explanation, cancellation policy clarity. At proposal creation: trust reinforcement signals -- what happens after submission, how the payment is protected, what the guest's rights are if terms change.

The guest's skill at reading this page grows with each visit, but the challenge remains fixed. By visit 4-5, the guest has memorized the layout, knows where everything is, and finds nothing new. The page becomes what Flow calls a 'boredom zone' (A2) -- skills exceed challenge.

The guest's skill is low; the information should be onboarding-oriented. Phase 2 (Weeks 4-9, Rhythm): primary content shifts to ongoing management -- upcoming stay details, date change tools, micro-review prompts after each stay cycle, payment milestones, usage patterns ('You have completed 6 of 13 stay cycles'). The guest now has skill; the information should present new challenges. Phase 3 (Weeks 10-13, Reflection): primary content becomes forward-looking -- cumulative stay summary, review composition prompt, lease renewal consideration, transition planning. The guest is at peak skill; the information should acknowledge their mastery and invite deeper engagement.

      "journey_phases": ["negotiation"],
      "problem": "Negotiation is the most informationally impoverished phase of the guest journey. When the host sends a counter-offer (e.g., changing duration from 16 to 10 weeks), the guest faces a high-stakes decision with almost no information to calibrate against. They do not know: what other guests have paid for similar spaces, what the typical negotiation outcome looks like, whether the counter is an opening position or a final offer, what the host's response pattern has been in previous negotiations. Without calibration data, the guest cannot assess whether the counter is reasonable, making the decision feel like gambling (Caillois's alea) rather than skilled competition (agon). Csikszentmihalyi identifies this as the anomie condition: 'When it is no longer clear what is permitted and what is not... behavior becomes erratic and meaningless.' The guest in an uncalibrated negotiation does not know what is normal, what is fair, or what is achievable. They also face a binary information architecture -- accept or reject -- that eliminates the sense of control Flow requires. There is no information about a counter-offer path, a compromise structure, or what specific elements are negotiable.",
      "solution": "Add calibration information to the negotiation interface that transforms the guest from a passive recipient of terms into an informed participant in collaborative term-setting. Show: (1) Context data: 'Similar listings in this area average X nights/week at Y price.' This gives the guest a reference point for evaluating the counter, reducing anomie. (2) Difference visualization: a side-by-side comparison of the original proposal and the counter-offer, with each changed element highlighted and the financial impact calculated. The guest should not need to compute differences mentally. (3) Negotiation guidance: 'This host typically responds within X hours and has accepted modified terms in Y% of negotiations.' This makes the negotiation feel like a game with knowable patterns, not a coin flip. (4) Action options beyond accept/reject: 'Accept these terms,' 'Suggest a modification' (with guided fields for which elements to adjust), or 'Decline with message' (explaining why). Each option should show its likely outcome: 'Hosts who receive a modification suggestion respond 80% of the time.' The information architecture should frame negotiation as Csikszentmihalyi's agon -- two parties seeking together -- not as a take-it-or-leave-it ultimatum.",

      "journey_phases": ["search", "listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Flow requires concentration 'so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant.' But the guest journey's information architecture repeatedly forces context switches that inject irrelevant information into the guest's consciousness. The most explicitly identified instance is authentication: 'Inline auth pop-up, not a full-page redirect. Users don't lose search context.' But the pattern extends to every transition: search to listing loads a new page with a new layout, forcing the guest to re-orient. Returning from a listing to search may lose scroll position, filter state, and map view. Moving from listing to proposal loads a new form context. Each context switch introduces what Csikszentmihalyi calls 'stimulus overinclusion' -- the guest must process the new page's layout, navigation, and structure before returning attention to their actual task. This is not a UI problem but an information architecture problem: the information is organized by page, not by task. The guest's task (find and secure a place) spans pages, but the information boundaries do not.",
      "solution": "Reorganize the information architecture around the guest's task flow rather than around page boundaries. The principle is information containment: everything the guest needs for their current sub-task should be accessible within their current context, without navigation. Search context (filters, map state, scroll position, viewed cards) must persist when the guest inspects a listing and return intact when they come back. Listing evaluation context (photos, price, host info) must persist when the guest initiates a proposal. The proposal form should appear as a continuation of the listing context, not a separate page. Authentication must be contained within a modal overlay that preserves the underlying page state entirely. Specifically: (1) Listing preview should be available as an expandable panel or overlay from search, not a full page navigation. The search grid remains visible behind it. (2) Proposal initiation from a listing should expand the listing context downward or open as a panel, preserving the listing content above so the guest can reference it while filling in the proposal. (3) Back-navigation must be state-preserving: exact scroll position, exact filter selections, exact map zoom and center. (4) Any system interruption (session timeout, error, notification) must be delivered as a non-destructive overlay that the guest can dismiss to return to their exact prior state.",
