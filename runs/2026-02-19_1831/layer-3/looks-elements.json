      "journey_phases": ["search", "listing_evaluation"],
      "problem": "The listing card currently presents a single visual density regardless of the guest's engagement level. A first-time visitor and a returning power-searcher see the same flat card with the same depth of visual information. Csikszentmihalyi's A1-to-A4 progression predicts that as the guest's search skills grow, a static card moves them from flow (A1) into boredom (A2): 'After a while, if he keeps practicing, his skills are bound to improve, and then he will grow bored just batting the ball over the net.' The user stories confirm this: 'The current card works but it is leaving engagement on the table. Richer hover states, image counters, availability indicators, neighborhood labels, and quick actions -- all without leaving the search grid.' Visually, the card lacks the layered complexity that keeps a growing-skill guest in the flow channel.",
      "solution": "Design the listing card with three visual density tiers that reveal themselves through interaction, creating the visual complexity ratchet that Flow demands. Tier 1 (default): hero photo at full bleed with price badge (--text-dark on --bg-white surface), location label in --font-inter at --text-sm, and a single availability dot (green/amber/red). Maximum 4 visual elements. Clean, glanceable, optimized for System 1 scanning. Tier 2 (hover/focus): the card elevates via --shadow-md transitioning to --shadow-purple-md over --transition-base (0.2s) with --easing-ease-in-out. New visual elements fade in: image counter badge (e.g., '1/8') in a frosted pill using --overlay-light-blur, neighborhood label in --text-sm with --font-weight-medium, host response time micro-badge, and a subtle save-heart icon at --opacity-hover that brightens to full on hover. Maximum 4 additional elements. Tier 3 (expanded preview or long-hover): a bottom drawer slides up within the card (not a new page), revealing transit proximity icons, availability calendar strip, and a 'Message Host' quick-action pill. This tier uses --spacing-sm internal padding and --rounded-lg corners. Transition between tiers uses the taste model's principle: fast response (< 100ms acknowledgment via shadow lift), gentle settle (300ms for content reveal). Each tier must feel like zooming into a photograph -- the structure stays, detail increases.",

When the guest pans, zooms, or hovers over a neighborhood, the map provides no visual feedback -- no contextual data appears, no pins animate, no neighborhood boundaries highlight. Csikszentmihalyi identifies feedback as one of four necessary conditions for flow: 'a goal-directed, rule-bound action system that provides clear clues as to how well one is performing.' A static map provides no clues. The guest explores but receives no visual signal that their exploration is productive. The user stories describe this gap precisely: 'Transit stops, landmarks, real-time context -- this is about mood, not just utility. The feeling that something is happening.'",
      "solution": "Design the map as a visual feedback system where every guest interaction produces a visible response, creating the sense of 'aliveness' the user stories demand. Pin behavior: listing pins at rest use a small, muted dot (8px, --primary-purple at 60% opacity). On map hover-proximity, pins scale to 12px and increase to full opacity over --transition-fast (0.1s). The pin currently under the cursor or nearest to it elevates to 16px with --shadow-purple-sm glow. This creates a visual field effect: the map breathes around the guest's cursor. Neighborhood feedback: when the guest's cursor dwells over a neighborhood zone for 500ms+, a translucent boundary fades in (--primary-purple at 8% opacity fill, --secondary-purple at 40% opacity stroke, 1px dashed) with a floating label showing the neighborhood name in --font-inter --text-sm --font-weight-semibold. Transit and landmark icons appear as small monochrome Feather icons (--icon-xs, 16px) at 60% opacity, fading in over --transition-base (0.2s). Panning feedback: as the guest pans, new pins load with a subtle scale-up entrance animation (from 0.8 to 1.0 scale, --transition-base, --easing-ease-out). This communicates that new information is arriving in response to their action. Price context: on zoom-in past a threshold, price labels appear adjacent to pins in --font-inter --text-xs --font-weight-semibold, using --bg-white pills with --shadow-sm. On zoom-out, they fade out to prevent clutter. All map transitions respect prefers-reduced-motion by collapsing to instant state changes.",

      "problem": "Every full-page navigation between search, listing, and proposal forces a complete visual reset: new layout, new spatial arrangement, new scroll position. This visual discontinuity is what Csikszentmihalyi calls 'stimulus overinclusion' imposed by the system -- the guest must visually re-orient to a completely new screen when their attention should be invested in their task. The user stories identify authentication as the most egregious example: 'Inline auth pop-up, not a full-page redirect. Users don't lose search context.' But the visual continuity problem extends to every transition in the high-engagement path. L1 (works-003) and L2 (communicates-007) both identify concentration preservation as a high priority. The visual design must ensure that no transition forces the guest's eyes to 'start over' on a new page.",
      "solution": "Design transitions between search, listing, and proposal as visual transformations of the current view, not navigations to new views. Search-to-listing: when the guest clicks a card, the card expands in place or slides to become the listing detail panel. The search grid remains visible behind/beside it, dimmed to 40% opacity (--overlay-light at 0.6 opacity). The expansion animation uses --transition-slow (0.3s) with --easing-ease-out, giving the guest visual continuity: they can see exactly where they came from and how to get back. The listing panel slides in from the right edge with a max-width of --max-width-sidebar (380px) on desktop or full-screen with a visible back-arrow on mobile. Listing-to-proposal: when the guest initiates a proposal from the listing, the proposal form unfolds as a new section below or alongside the listing content -- not on a separate page. The listing photos, price, and host info remain visible above as reference context. The form appears via a downward expand animation (height: 0 to auto, --transition-slow, --easing-ease-out). Authentication overlay: a centered modal (--max-width-modal 400px, --rounded-2xl 16px corners, --shadow-xl) with --overlay-dark (rgba(0,0,0,0.7)) backdrop. The underlying page remains fully rendered but inert. After auth completes, the modal dismisses (--transition-base fade-out) and the guest is exactly where they were -- no visual reset, no scroll change, no layout shift.

L0 identifies it as 'critical' dropout risk because the guest transitions from passive evaluation to active creation. Visually, if the proposal form arrives as a separate page with a new layout, new color treatment, or unfamiliar form patterns, the guest's visual flow breaks precisely when they are most committed. Csikszentmihalyi warns that self-consciousness destroys flow: 'A person who is constantly worried about how others will perceive her, who is afraid of creating the wrong impression, or of doing something inappropriate, is also condemned to permanent exclusion from enjoyment.' A cold, clinical form with empty fields amplifies self-consciousness. The guest sees blank space where they must produce content, and they worry about whether they are doing it correctly.",
      "solution": "Design the proposal form as a visual extension of the listing page, using pre-populated content and the listing's visual language to reduce self-consciousness and maintain flow. Visual continuity: the form shares the same background color (--bg-white or --bg-off-white), the same type hierarchy (--font-inter, same size scale), and the same spacing rhythm (--spacing-lg, --spacing-2xl) as the listing page. There is no visual break between listing content and proposal content. Pre-populated visual state: instead of empty form fields, the form arrives with the listing's dates, price, and location pre-filled, rendered in the same visual treatment as the listing detail (--text-dark, --font-weight-medium). The pre-populated fields use a subtle background tint (--bg-light #f9fafb) to indicate they are editable but not empty. This transforms the visual message from 'fill in these blank boxes' to 'confirm or adjust these pre-set values.' Real-time price feedback: as the guest adjusts dates or duration, the total price updates visually in real time using a --transition-fast (0.1s) color pulse -- the price text briefly highlights in --secondary-purple before settling back to --text-dark.

If the page looks the same on visit 1 and visit 13, Csikszentmihalyi's complexity ratchet guarantees boredom by mid-lease: 'One cannot enjoy doing the same thing at the same level for long.' L1 (works-004) and L2 (communicates-004) both identify this as a critical gap. The visual design challenge is specific: the page layout must remain stable (clarity -- one of the five autotelic traits) while the visual content within it must evolve (challenge -- another autotelic trait). Static visual content on a weekly-visit page is the visual equivalent of the Shushwap's 'world becoming too predictable.'",
      "solution": "Design the Stays Manager with a fixed visual skeleton and temporally-evolving visual content. Stable skeleton: the page divides into three persistent visual zones -- (1) a top action band (time-sensitive items, max 3), (2) a main content area (this week's stay + engagement prompt), and (3) a reference footer (lease terms, House Manual, host contact). These zones occupy the same screen positions on every visit. Their visual containers (--rounded-xl cards, --shadow-sm, --border-color) never change. The guest always knows where to look. Evolving content: the visual elements within each zone change weekly. The action band surfaces new visual badges when items need attention: a purple dot indicator (--secondary-purple, 8px, --rounded-full) for new messages, an amber indicator (--status-warning proposed #C4841D) for upcoming date changes, a count badge for review prompts. These indicators appear only when relevant and disappear when addressed, creating the visual feedback loop of 'something new each visit.' The main content area shifts its primary visual weight across the lease phases. Weeks 1-3 (orientation): a visual checklist with Feather check-circle icons (--icon-sm 20px) that the guest completes -- visually satisfying as checks turn from --text-light-gray to --secondary-purple. Weeks 4-9 (rhythm): a visual stay timeline showing completed and upcoming stay cycles as a horizontal progress visualization -- filled segments in --secondary-purple, upcoming in --bg-light-gray, with the current week highlighted via --shadow-purple-sm glow. A micro-review prompt appears as a compact card (--rounded-lg, --bg-off-white) after each completed stay cycle. Weeks 10-13 (reflection): a cumulative visual summary -- total nights stayed, total reviews written, a mini-heatmap of stay patterns. The visual density increases across phases, matching the guest's growing platform skill. 'What changed since last visit' indicator: a subtle animated dot or highlight (--secondary-purple pulse, 2s cycle, respects prefers-reduced-motion) on any section that has new content since the guest's last visit.",

L2 (communicates-003) identifies that trust information must be distributed across all pre-commitment phases, calibrated to each phase's decision gate. The visual challenge is: how should trust signals look so they are instantly recognizable across contexts (card, listing, proposal) without competing for visual attention with primary content? Csikszentmihalyi identifies 'commitment' (the trust that allows unselfconscious involvement) as one of five conditions for the autotelic family context. Without consistent, recognizable trust visuals, the guest remains in a defensive, self-conscious evaluation mode that prevents flow entry.",
      "solution": "Establish a unified visual grammar for trust signals that scales from compact (search card) to detailed (listing page) to reassuring (proposal form), using consistent visual elements across all contexts. Core visual language: all trust signals share a common visual DNA -- a small Feather shield-check icon (--icon-xs 16px) paired with a monochrome text label in --font-inter --text-xs --font-weight-medium, rendered in --text-gray (#5A6370 proposed) on a --bg-light-gray (#f3f4f6) pill with --rounded-pill (20px). This visual pattern is the 'trust badge' and it appears everywhere trust is communicated. Discovery (ambient): platform-level trust signals appear as a horizontal strip of small pills at the top or bottom of the landing view -- 'ID Verified Hosts', '2,400+ Stays Completed', 'Payment Protected'. Visually lightweight: --text-xs, no icons, no bold, --text-light-gray on --bg-light. They set a trust floor without demanding attention. Search card (compact): a single trust badge on each card -- the host's verification status. One shield-check icon + 'Verified' + review count number. Positioned bottom-left of the card, using --text-xs. Visually subordinate to price and location. Listing page (detailed): a dedicated trust section with three visual rows: (1) host verification badge (expanded: photo, name, verification badges, member-since date), (2) review summary (star rating in --secondary-purple + count + most recent excerpt), (3) guarantee strip ('Payment held until 48hrs after move-in' in an info-tinted bar using --bg-info #f0f7ff with --info-blue icon). Each row uses consistent left-alignment, --spacing-lg between rows. Proposal form (reassuring): inline trust micro-copy adjacent to commitment fields. Next to the payment field: a small shield icon + 'Your payment is held securely' in --text-gray --text-xs. Next to the submit button: 'You can modify or withdraw before the host accepts' in --text-light-gray --text-xs. These are visually minimal but precisely positioned at the moment of maximum anxiety.",

L1 (works-002) and L2 (communicates-002) identify this as a cross-phase pattern: the map does not respond to exploration, the proposal form shows summaries only after completion, negotiation has no visual signal during the waiting period. The visual design lacks a dedicated feedback layer -- a set of lightweight, consistent visual micro-responses that acknowledge every meaningful guest action without cluttering the interface.",
      "solution": "Establish a visual feedback layer that sits between the primary content layer (information) and the system chrome layer (navigation), providing immediate micro-responses to guest actions. Button and CTA acknowledgment: on click/tap, buttons execute a brief scale-down-then-up pulse (scale 0.97 to 1.0, --transition-fast 0.1s, --easing-ease) plus an immediate color shift (--secondary-purple to --secondary-purple-hover, or gradient shift for gradient buttons). This provides the < 100ms acknowledgment the taste model demands. Form field focus: on focus, input fields receive a 3px ring in rgba(109,49,194,0.15) -- the same purple-tinted focus ring documented in the style guide -- plus a bottom border color transition from --border-color to --secondary-purple over --transition-fast. This signals 'the system is listening to this field.' Filter application: when the guest applies a search filter, affected listing cards animate a brief opacity dip (1.0 to 0.7 to 1.0, --transition-base 0.2s) to signal that results have changed. New cards entering the grid use a fade-in from 0 to 1.0 opacity over --transition-base. Cards leaving the grid shrink to 0.95 scale and fade to 0 over --transition-fast. The net visual effect: the grid visibly responds to every filter change. Progress indicators: any multi-step process (proposal form, onboarding) shows a compact horizontal progress bar at the top of its container. The bar fills in --secondary-purple with a subtle shine gradient (linear-gradient from --secondary-purple to a slightly lighter variant). Each completed step triggers a micro-fill animation (width transition, --transition-base, --easing-ease-out). Waiting states: during async waits (proposal submitted, waiting for host), show a contextual pulse -- a subtle, slow opacity cycle (1.0 to 0.6 to 1.0, 2s cycle) on a status indicator pill.
