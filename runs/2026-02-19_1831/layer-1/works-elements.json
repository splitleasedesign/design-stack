      "problem": "Each phase transition in the guest journey demands skills the guest has not yet developed, creating systematic anxiety spikes (Csikszentmihalyi's A3 zone) that push guests out of the flow channel. Discovery requires no skill; search requires reading listing cards; listing evaluation requires assessing credibility; proposal creation requires understanding lease mechanics. The jump between these skill levels has no scaffolding. The user stories explicitly identify this at the listing evaluation to proposal boundary: 'The jump from card to proposal skips steps people naturally need.' The current design offers no intermediate challenge between passive browsing and full proposal commitment. Guests who are ready to do more than browse but not ready to propose have nowhere to go, so they leave.",
      "solution": "Insert an intermediate-challenge action at every phase transition that raises the guest's perceived skill before the next phase's challenge arrives. Specifically: (1) Between search and listing evaluation, the listing card must offer progressive disclosure layers (hover states, image counters, availability indicators, neighborhood labels) so the guest builds evaluation skills while still in the search grid, not only after clicking through. (2) Between listing evaluation and proposal creation, messaging must be available as a lower-stakes action that builds the guest's confidence and familiarity with the host before the full proposal challenge. As the user stories note: 'Once someone messages a host, the path to a proposal gets shorter, not longer.' (3) Each intermediate action must provide immediate feedback (message delivered confirmation, host response time estimate, saved listing acknowledgment) so the guest perceives skill growth. (4) The system should track the guest's progression through these intermediate challenges and surface contextual prompts when the guest's behavior signals readiness for the next level.",

      "problem": "Flow requires immediate feedback throughout an activity, but the current guest journey provides feedback only after actions are completed. The map shows static pins with no response to exploration. Listing cards reveal the same depth of information regardless of engagement level. The proposal form shows a price summary only after the guest has configured all fields. Negotiation provides no signal during the waiting period between submission and host counter-offer. Csikszentmihalyi identifies feedback as one of four necessary conditions for flow: the guest must know how well they are performing at every moment, not just at the end. The user stories describe this gap concretely -- the map should 'feel alive' and listing cards need 'availability indicators' -- but the pattern extends to every phase where the guest is taking action.",
      "solution": "Redesign every guest action sequence to provide continuous, real-time feedback rather than end-of-action summaries. Specifically: (1) Search: the map must respond to every interaction -- hovering over a neighborhood should surface contextual data (transit, price range, availability), panning should load new results seamlessly, and filtering should animate card changes so the guest perceives cause-and-effect between their action and the result. (2) Proposal creation: as the guest selects dates, the price calculation should update in real time. As they type a message, a quality indicator should signal whether the proposal is likely to get a fast response. Pre-populated fields should appear filled as soon as listing context loads, giving immediate visual feedback that the system is working for the guest. (3) Negotiation: after submitting a proposal, the guest must receive progress signals -- host viewed notification, host typing indicator, estimated response time based on host's historical pattern. The waiting period must not be a feedback vacuum. (4) Every form field should validate in real time, not on submission. Errors discovered after completion break flow; errors caught during typing preserve it.",

      "problem": "The guest's flow state is repeatedly broken by system-imposed context switches at moments of high engagement. The most explicit example from user stories: authentication triggers a full-page redirect, forcing the guest to process an entirely new screen (login page) when their attention is focused on search or a listing. But the pattern extends beyond auth: navigating from search to a listing loads a new page, breaking spatial context. Returning from a listing to search may reset scroll position. Moving from listing evaluation to proposal creation requires entering a new form context. Each switch forces what Csikszentmihalyi calls 'stimulus overinclusion' -- the guest must process irrelevant information (new page layout, where am I, how do I get back) when their psychic energy should be invested in the task. Flow requires concentration 'so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant.' Every context switch injects irrelevant processing.",
      "solution": "Eliminate or minimize every context switch in the high-engagement path from search through proposal submission. Specifically: (1) Authentication must be inline -- a modal overlay that preserves the current page state, as the user stories demand: 'Inline auth pop-up, not a full-page redirect. Users don't lose search context.' (2) Listing evaluation should be accessible without a full page navigation where possible -- either through an expanded card, a slide-over panel, or a modal that preserves the search grid behind it, so the guest can return to their exact position. (3) Proposal creation from a listing should flow as a continuation of the listing page, not a separate form on a separate URL. The transition should feel like scrolling deeper into the listing, not leaving it. (4) Any system-initiated interruption (session timeout, error, notification) must be handled in-context through non-destructive overlays that preserve the guest's current state. (5) Browser back-button behavior must be predictable: back should return to the exact prior state, including scroll position, filter selections, and map zoom level.",

A Stays Manager that presents identical content and identical interactions on visit 1 and visit 13 guarantees boredom by mid-lease (A2 in the flow diagram). The guest's skill grows with each visit -- they understand the system, know their schedule, recognize the host's patterns -- but the challenge remains static. This mismatch between growing skill and fixed challenge is the textbook condition for flow collapse. The Shushwap analogy from the book is instructive: even a rich environment must be periodically renewed or 'the challenge began to go out of life.'

Low challenge matched to low skill. (2) Mid-lease visits (weeks 3-8): introduce engagement challenges -- one-tap micro-reviews after each stay cycle, date change management, stay quality signals, community participation. The guest now has skill to handle more complex interactions. (3) Late-lease visits (weeks 9-13): surface forward-looking challenges -- lease renewal consideration, cumulative review summary, recommendation to other guests, transition planning. The guest's skill is at its peak and needs peak-level challenges to maintain flow.

But the platform currently treats each as a transactional form submission -- a text box and a submit button. The social dimension is invisible.

      "problem": "Flow cannot begin until the guest perceives a structured, goal-directed activity worth investing psychic energy in. But the current discovery phase may demand investment (sign-up, personal information, preferences) before showing value (listings, neighborhoods, social proof). The user stories are explicit: 'Any flow that requires users to give information before seeing results will lose most of them.' Csikszentmihalyi's framework explains why: entering a flow state requires that the activity be 'as distinct as possible from the paramount reality of everyday existence.' If discovery feels like every other sign-up-first website, it is not distinct from everyday experience -- it is everyday experience. The guest perceives no ordered system worth entering, no rules to learn, no goals to pursue. They leave before the flow channel even opens. Additionally, Csikszentmihalyi describes anomie -- 'when it is no longer clear what is permitted and what is not' -- as a social obstacle to flow. A guest who arrives at a platform with no visible structure, no clear next step, and no evidence that others have succeeded here experiences platform-level anomie.",
      "solution": "Show the full activity structure before asking for any investment. Specifically: (1) The first screen must display real listings with real data -- not a sign-up form, not a value proposition page, not an onboarding wizard. The guest must see the 'game board' before being asked to play. (2) Search must be fully functional without authentication. The guest should be able to filter, map-explore, view listing cards, and click into full listings without creating an account. Authentication arrives only when they attempt a high-intent action (message, save, propose). (3) Social proof (verified reviews, host history, guest testimonials) must be visible at discovery to demonstrate that others have successfully navigated this system -- reducing anomie by showing that clear rules exist and that participation is rewarded. (4) The platform's rule structure must be communicated quickly: what can I do here, what are the steps, what happens if I apply? A brief visual journey map or progress indicator on the first visit establishes the goal structure that flow requires.",

These five traits form a universal checklist for any environment that seeks to sustain flow. The guest journey currently violates multiple traits at multiple phases: clarity is broken when the guest does not know what happens after submitting a proposal; centering is broken when the platform focuses on future obligations (payment schedule) rather than present experience (your stay this week); choice is broken when the only options are accept or reject a counter-offer; commitment (trust) is broken when reviews and host verification are absent; and challenge is broken when the Stays Manager presents identical content on every visit. No single phase violates all five, but every phase violates at least one, and the cumulative effect prevents the platform from becoming the 'great game' that Csikszentmihalyi describes.",
      "solution": "Audit and redesign every phase of the guest journey against the five autotelic traits, treating them as a design checklist. Specifically: (1) Clarity -- every screen must make the guest's available actions and their consequences explicit. After proposal submission, show exactly what happens next and when. After acceptance, show the timeline from now to move-in. No phase should end without the guest knowing what the next phase will bring. (2) Centering -- prioritize present-tense content over future-tense content. The Stays Manager should show 'your stay this week' before 'your payment due next month.' Listing evaluation should show 'what your life looks like here' before 'what the lease terms are.' (3) Choice -- every phase must offer at least two meaningful actions, not a single forced path. At listing evaluation: message or propose. At negotiation: accept, counter, or withdraw with a clear explanation of each path. At active lease: review, manage dates, message host, explore community. (4) Commitment (trust) -- embed trust signals (reviews, verification, guarantees) at every phase, not just discovery. The guest's trust must be continuously reinforced, not assumed after initial sign-up. (5) Challenge -- ensure each phase presents a challenge appropriate to the guest's current skill level, with the complexity ratchet built into the Stays Manager for the longest phase.",
