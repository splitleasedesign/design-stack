For stay-by-stay reviews (12+ reviews per lease), visual weight signals effort level. A heavy, form-like card creates review fatigue. Guests see the visual complexity and abandon before even starting. The microinteractions principle 'Less Is More' applies: feedback should match importance without overwhelming.",
      "solution": "Design review prompts as lightweight cards with minimal visual weight: small footprint (max 360px wide on mobile), soft rounded corners (--rounded-xl: 12px), single-column layout, generous white space (--spacing-2xl: 24px internal padding). Use the purple palette's lightest tints for backgrounds (--bg-off-white: rgb(252, 250, 255)) to keep visual weight low. Limit visible fields to 2-3 items max: star rating (largest), optional comment field (secondary), optional issue flag (tertiary, small). Visual hierarchy through size, not color intensity—keep the card feeling open and breathable, not dense. The card should feel like a quick interaction, not a form.",

Each star subtly scales up on hover/tap for tactile feedback. (2) **Emoji mood scale (alternative)**: Replace stars with 5 emoji faces ranging from 😞 (1) to 😊 (5), sized at 40px each. Tapping an emoji triggers a gentle bounce animation. Use grayscale for unselected states, full color for selected.
