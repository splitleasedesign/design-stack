      "problem": "After submitting a review, guests often feel used—like they did the platform a favor without receiving anything in return. Traditional 'Thank you for your review!' messages feel hollow and transactional. For 12+ reviews per lease, this emotional deficit compounds. By stay 5-6, guests think 'I keep giving feedback, what do I get?' and stop participating. The emotional exchange feels one-sided.",
      "solution": "Transform review submission into a moment of genuine reciprocity. Immediately after submission, show a warm confirmation that emphasizes mutual benefit: 'Your review helps 50+ guests searching right now' with a subtle animation showing ripple effects (numbers incrementing, small avatars appearing). Use warm language that acknowledges the guest's contribution as community-building, not platform service. For reviews 5+, add personalized gratitude: 'You've reviewed 5 stays—you're helping build trust on Split Lease.' The emotion shifts from 'I did them a favor' to 'I contributed to something meaningful.'",
