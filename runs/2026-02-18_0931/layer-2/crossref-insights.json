  "crossref_summary": "The transcripts overwhelmingly validate the core disappointments identified in Layer 1. The most strongly validated pattern is the identity/trust gap (disappoint-001, disappoint-007): hosts and guests independently and repeatedly express anxiety about who the other party is, requesting LinkedIn profiles, Zoom meetings, background checks, and vetting confirmation. The platform-as-void pattern (disappoint-010) is validated by the nneka-call transcript, where a guest (Brad) texts the host directly to reschedule because the platform has no active-stay tool. The comparison/cognitive overload pattern (disappoint-002) surfaces in multiple guest calls where prospects describe options and price confusion. The communication ejection pattern (disappoint-009) is validated by hosts and guests defaulting to email, text, and phone for all substantive interaction. What emerges most forcefully from the transcripts is that Split Lease's human agents (Bryant, Robert, Vale) are currently performing the functions that a platform should perform: they are the face, the trust signal, the comparison scaffolding, and the communication channel. Every disappointment in HotPads' UX is also a description of what happens when the human intermediary is removed -- which is the exact transition Split Lease must navigate as it scales.",
