The convergence signal is overwhelming. rb-ui-0931-006 adds the specific habit-formation mechanism (Thing #60: small steps over time) and the micro-review as the variable reward (Thing #51) that previous runs identified as needed but did not specify at the interaction level."

As Split Lease scales and reduces agent dependency, host trust becomes the primary trust mechanism.

The Weinschenk framework adds Thing #31 (mental models): users arrive with a monthly-rent mental model, and nightly pricing VIOLATES this model.
