The platform should help narrow to 3-4 strong candidates and then support the unconscious decision process (e.g., through stories and social proof) rather than the conscious comparison process (e.g., through spec sheets).",

      "why_nobody_tries": "Listing platforms are lead-gen businesses. Their revenue event happens at inquiry, not at move-in. Building active-stay features would require a fundamentally different business model (subscription, transaction fees, or tenant services). It would also require landlord buy-in for features like maintenance, payments, and communication. The organizational and business model barriers are immense.",

Weekly or monthly touchpoints (rent payment, maintenance, date changes for flexible leases) create the small, repeated steps that Weinschenk says are required for habit formation. The platform that owns the active stay owns the user's loyalty for the next search.",

      "why_nobody_tries": "Stories are expensive to collect (they require engaged, motivated residents), hard to verify (unlike specs), and legally sensitive (negative stories about landlords create liability). Star ratings are cheap and scalable. The industry has converged on the lowest-effort feedback format because the business model does not reward qualitative depth.",

The entire rental category operates on the weakest form of communication (specs and data) while ignoring the strongest (stories and anecdotes). A platform that collected and displayed narrative micro-reviews -- 'What was your Tuesday morning like here?' -- would create a fundamentally different evaluation experience.",

Additionally, acknowledging that housing search is stressful might reduce the appearance of a smooth, easy experience -- which goes against marketing incentives.",

Stressed renters seek familiar patterns (Thing #84) and make fast, defensive decisions.
