Shomit refuses to bid three times despite being told the action is non-binding, because he has not yet surveyed all options or confirmed his own timeline. The interaction challenge is that action prompts appear at a fixed point in the page flow regardless of whether the guest has demonstrated sufficient orientation. This creates a state mismatch: the UI is in 'ready to act' state while the guest is still in 'still exploring' state. Csikszentmihalyi's paradox of control explains the mechanism -- the guest cannot exercise control without first mapping the decision space, and premature action prompts trigger retreat into protective routines ('I'll hold off').",
      "solution": "Gate the visibility and prominence of action prompts based on the guest's demonstrated orientation state. The save button should begin in a dormant or de-emphasized state and only become visually prominent after the guest has interacted with comparison-relevant content (viewed 2+ listings, adjusted schedule filters, or spent >60 seconds in active search). The interaction principle: the UI should mirror the guest's readiness rather than pushing a fixed conversion funnel. Orientation signals include: number of listings viewed, filter interactions, time on search page, and scroll depth on listing pages.",

Every schedule adjustment (changing nights, weeks, or day selection) produces a pricing change that the guest must mentally translate from per-night to monthly terms. This translation is an interaction gap: the guest acts (adjusts schedule), but the feedback they need (monthly cost impact) is not immediate or is absent entirely. The agent promises 'you can play with that on the website and it will give you all options dynamically' (line 49) -- this sets an expectation of instantaneous, game-like feedback. Csikszentmihalyi identifies immediate feedback as one of the core conditions for engagement -- without it, the guest cannot evaluate whether their action moved them closer to their budget goal.",
      "solution": "Pre-load the pricing matrix for each listing the guest views. When the guest opens a listing page or hovers on a listing card in search, the client receives the full per-night rate table for that property. Schedule adjustments then trigger a pure client-side recalculation that updates the monthly cost display within a single animation frame. The update uses a number transition: the monthly figure counts from the old value to the new value over 300ms using the out easing, providing a visual signal that the cost changed and by how much. The direction of the count (up or down) immediately tells the guest whether adding or removing a night made it more or less expensive.

Shomit's response -- 'So like courtship' (line 61) -- reveals how the guest perceives this: as an uncertain, open-ended process where they do not know if the other party is still engaged. The interaction challenge is not the duration itself but the silence within the duration. After the guest places their first expression of interest, they enter a matching process with no described intermediate feedback. Each gap is a void where the guest's engagement decays and competing alternatives fill the vacuum.

This is not acceptance -- it is unresolved processing masked as acceptance. The interaction challenge is that co-tenancy information has different salience at different phases. In discovery, the guest needs only the concept. In listing evaluation, practical details. In negotiation, social preparation. At move-in, verification. Currently, the agent dumps the concept in discovery and the Zoom meeting handles negotiation. The phases in between have no structured co-tenancy interaction. When unresolved uncertainty meets a decision point (save a property? sign a lease?), it amplifies reluctance to act.",
      "solution": "Implement phase-triggered co-tenancy information modules that activate based on the guest's journey state. (1) Discovery: show only the timeline diagram (day badges in accent color for guest, light gray for co-tenant) with a single sentence: 'You use the space Mon-Thu. Someone else uses it Fri-Sun. You never overlap.' Zero additional detail. (2) Listing evaluation: an expandable 'Shared Living Details' section showing shared vs. private zones, cleaning protocol, storage arrangements. Expands on tap with settle animation. (3) Pre-negotiation: a preparation card delivered 24-48 hours before the Zoom meeting with co-tenant profile summary, 5 suggested questions, and explicit 'You can decline after meeting' reassurance. (4) Move-in: arrival-day notification with 5-item co-tenancy FAQ addressing common first-day concerns. (5) Active lease: a structured feedback channel for co-tenancy concerns that does not require direct co-tenant confrontation. Each module is self-contained and does not reference future modules.",

The interaction problem is that the action -- regardless of its name -- carries behavioral weight that contradicts its stated nature. A button labeled 'Place a Bid' that opens a form requiring schedule selection, budget entry, and confirmation creates an interaction that FEELS like binding commitment even when the text says otherwise. The behavioral weight of the interaction (multiple steps, form fields, confirmation dialog) signals 'this is significant' to the guest's System 1, overriding System 2 understanding that it is non-binding. Csikszentmihalyi's paradox of control applies: the guest will act only when the action feels like organizing options (exercising control), not entering a process (surrendering control). The interaction weight must match the actual commitment weight: near-zero.",

The listing card immediately shows a 'Saved' state (filled icon, accent-light background flash, 300ms). No form. No confirmation dialog. No schedule re-entry (the guest's schedule is already set from search filters). No modal. The action writes the guest's current schedule and the listing to their saved-properties list. The guest can undo with a single tap on the same icon (toggle back to unsaved). After saving, a subtle inline message: 'Saved to your shortlist. We will start finding your co-tenant match.'
