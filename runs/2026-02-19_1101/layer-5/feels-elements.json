      "problem": "The guest feels pressured to commit before they have mapped the decision landscape. Shomit refuses to bid three times despite understanding it is non-binding. The emotional challenge is not ignorance but a felt lack of mastery over the available options. When the platform asks for action before the guest feels oriented, the guest experiences the interaction as a threat to their autonomy rather than an invitation to participate. This produces a defensive emotional stance -- 'I'll hold off' -- that is rational self-protection, not disengagement.",
      "solution": "Build the guest's felt sense of informational mastery before presenting any action. The emotional arc should be: curiosity (what is available?) -> comprehension (I understand my options) -> confidence (I know which option fits me) -> action (I choose this one). Every touchpoint in search and listing evaluation should reinforce the guest's growing sense of 'I know what I'm looking at.' Copy, tone, and interaction should communicate 'take your time, this is yours to explore' rather than 'act now before it's gone.' The guest should arrive at action feeling like they chose the right moment, not like the platform chose it for them.",

          "insight": "The emotional state is not reluctance but unfinished orientation. 'I want to see' is an active desire to explore, not a passive refusal.

Shomit says 'I guess mainly I think of this per month' -- this is not a preference but an emotional frame. When a listing shows $66/night, the guest feels uncertain because the number does not answer the question their emotions are organized around: 'Can I afford this per month?' The cognitive work of translating per-night to per-month creates a micro-anxiety at every pricing touchpoint. This arithmetic-as-anxiety accumulates across listings and erodes the emotional energy needed for confident decision-making.",
      "solution": "Make the guest's monthly cost the first and most emotionally salient number they encounter on every listing. The monthly figure should feel like relief -- the instant answer to the question the guest is already carrying. Pair it with a savings comparison to the guest's existing rental frame ('vs. $2,500/mo full-time lease: you save $1,444'). The emotional effect of seeing both numbers together should be a small jolt of positive surprise: 'This is much less than I expected.' The per-night breakdown should feel like optional detail, not the primary information. The goal is that within 2 seconds of seeing any listing, the guest feels 'I know what this costs in my terms.'",

The 'ghost roommates' metaphor, while memorable, activates a slightly unsettling mental image rather than a reassuring one.

This unresolved unease persists as background anxiety through every subsequent phase, subtly undermining the confidence needed for commitment.",
      "solution": "Address co-tenancy with calm, matter-of-fact transparency that treats the arrangement as normal rather than novel. The emotional tone should be 'of course this is how it works' rather than 'let us explain this unusual thing.' Use concrete, spatial language instead of metaphors: show the guest exactly which days are theirs, what is private, what is shared, and how transitions work. The emotional goal at each phase is specific: at discovery, normalize ('many professionals share space this way'); at listing evaluation, ground in specifics ('here is what your Monday arrival looks like'); at negotiation, provide social preparation ('here are good questions to ask your co-tenant'); at move-in, verify ('here is the space, exactly as described').

Except for like one or two things' -- he absorbed the value proposition but is carrying unresolved items. The agent then adds more concepts (bids, matching, Zoom meeting) before resolving the existing ones. The emotional effect is information overwhelm that manifests not as confusion but as blanket deferral: 'I'll hold off.' When a guest feels overwhelmed by process complexity, their emotional default is to withdraw to safety. The platform must avoid triggering this withdrawal by matching the pace of new information to the guest's emotional readiness.",
