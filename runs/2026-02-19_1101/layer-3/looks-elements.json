      "problem": "The guest's budget mental model is monthly, but the platform's pricing is per-night. Every time Shomit encounters a price, he must perform arithmetic to determine affordability. Visually, if the per-night rate is the largest, most prominent number on a listing card, the guest's eye lands on a number that does not answer their actual question ('Can I afford this per month?'). This visual mismatch between what the eye sees first and what the brain needs to evaluate creates a micro-friction at every listing touchpoint. Csikszentmihalyi's immediate-feedback principle requires that the answer to the guest's budget question be visually instantaneous — no computation, no scanning for secondary numbers.",
      "solution": "Establish the monthly cost for the guest's selected schedule as the visually dominant number on every listing card and listing page. Use typographic scale, weight, and color to create an unambiguous hierarchy: the monthly figure is the largest, darkest, most prominent element in the pricing zone. The per-night rate is rendered smaller, lighter, and subordinate. A savings comparison line ('vs. $2,500/mo full lease') uses a muted color to provide context without competing for attention. The monthly figure should update in real time when the guest adjusts their schedule, with a brief transition animation (fade or count-up) that provides the 'immediate feedback' Csikszentmihalyi identifies as essential for engagement.",

      "problem": "The guest journey spans two to three weeks across multiple phases, but there is no persistent visual indicator of progress. Shomit describes the process as 'courtship' — an open-ended, uncertain pursuit. Without visual progress feedback, each time the guest returns to the platform, they must reconstruct their mental model of where they are and what comes next. Csikszentmihalyi identifies that even long-duration activities sustain engagement when incremental feedback is visible ('I like to see them grow day by day'). The platform currently provides no equivalent of 'watching plants grow' for the guest's multi-week housing search process.",
      "solution": "Design a persistent, compact process tracker that appears on every authenticated page. The tracker uses a horizontal step indicator with 5 named phases (Browse, Express Interest, Match, Meet, Sign). The current phase is visually highlighted with the brand accent color and slightly elevated through a subtle shadow. Completed phases use a muted fill. Future phases are outlined only, with reduced opacity. The tracker is compact by default (showing only the current step name and a progress line) and expands on interaction to show all steps. Crucially, the visual density of the tracker adapts to the guest's phase: early phases show a lightweight, unobtrusive bar; later phases (negotiation, acceptance) show more detail as the guest's investment and need for feedback increase.",
      "solution_continued": "Between milestones, the tracker's current-step indicator should include a brief status line in a secondary typeface ('Matching in progress — expected by Feb 28').

Shomit's triple hedge ('I guess that's fine... I guess that's fine') reveals that verbal explanation alone does not resolve spatial uncertainty. When a guest hears 'two people share the same space at different times,' they need to SEE the arrangement to understand it. Text-based explanations of spatial relationships force the guest to construct a mental image, which is effortful, error-prone, and produces unresolved anxiety. A visual diagram that shows the time-split arrangement communicates the concept faster and more completely than any paragraph.",
      "solution": "At every phase where co-tenancy is relevant, provide a visual spatial diagram rather than (or in addition to) text explanation. The diagram uses a simple two-color timeline: the guest's days are shown in the brand accent color, the co-tenant's days in a neutral gray, with clear separation between the two. The diagram is compact (fits in a single line), uses the same day-badge visual language already established in the style guide, and requires zero reading to understand. At discovery: the diagram appears alongside a single explanatory sentence. At listing evaluation: the diagram is integrated into the listing's schedule section, showing which days are the guest's and which are not. At negotiation: the diagram accompanies the co-tenant profile preview. At move-in: the diagram appears in arrival materials as a visual reminder of the schedule arrangement.",

The visual language of the button must match the actual commitment level of the action. Csikszentmihalyi's paradox of control reveals the mechanism: the guest will only act when they feel the action is an exercise of control, not a surrender of it.

On hover, the button fills with a light tint of the accent color (accent-light) rather than transitioning to a full solid button, maintaining the sense of lightness.

If the listing page buries verification options (tour, video walkthrough, lived-in photos) below the fold or behind interaction gates, the guest who needs sensory confirmation before committing will never discover these options exist. Csikszentmihalyi's feedback principle for the 'blind women' study is directly applicable: guests evaluating a space they have never seen need richer-than-usual visual feedback to compensate for the absence of direct sensory experience. The visual design must surface verification prominently, not as an afterthought.",
      "solution": "Create a visually distinct 'Verify This Space' section on every listing page, positioned after the photo gallery and pricing but before the action button. The section uses a warm surface background (surface-warm or bg-off-white) to visually differentiate it from surrounding content, with a clear heading and two pathways: 'Schedule a Visit' (if available) and 'Take Virtual Tour' (always available). Each pathway is represented as a card-like element with an icon, label, and brief description. The section should use a subtle left border accent in the brand color to draw the eye without overwhelming. If the listing includes lived-in-condition photos (not just staged ones), these should be called out with a small badge: 'Actual condition' in mono font to signal trustworthiness.",

Visually, if a page introduces multiple novel concepts simultaneously — through dense text blocks, multiple callout boxes, or a process diagram showing all steps at once — the guest's eye has no clear entry point and no rest between concepts.

The heading uses the serif font (Instrument Serif) for warmth and personality, the body uses the sans font (Outfit) for clarity, and any data element uses the mono font (IBM Plex Mono) for precision.
