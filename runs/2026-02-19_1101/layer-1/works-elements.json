      "problem": "The platform asks guests to take action (place a bid) before they have surveyed the full decision landscape. Shomit refuses to bid three separate times despite being told bids are non-binding, because he has not yet seen all options, confirmed his own timeline, or compared prices. The current process interprets early bidding as low-commitment exploration, but the guest interprets any action request as a premature commitment demand. This mismatch produces deferral and dropout: the guest feels pushed before they feel oriented.",
      "solution": "Ensure the guest can survey the complete decision landscape before any action is requested. This means: (1) The search phase must let the guest see all matching properties with pricing for their specific schedule before any bid prompt appears. (2) Comparison tools (side-by-side listings, monthly cost equivalents, schedule overlays) must be available and visible before the first call-to-action. (3) The bid prompt should appear only after the guest has interacted with at least two listings, signaling they have begun comparative evaluation. (4) Frame the first action not as 'place a bid' but as 'save this option' or 'mark as interested' to match the guest's actual decision stage. The principle: orientation precedes action, and the platform must confirm orientation before requesting action.",

      "problem": "Guests arrive with established mental models from traditional renting. Shomit thinks in monthly rent ('below 2,500 a month is what I would usually spend') but Split Lease prices per night. The agent must manually translate: '$66 per night for 4 nights.' Shomit himself notes this mismatch: 'I guess mainly I think of this per month and then I break it down per night.' Every time the guest encounters pricing, they must perform a cognitive translation that the platform should do for them. This translation burden accumulates across phases and produces confusion, comparison difficulty, and fatigue.",
      "solution": "Automatically translate between the guest's natural mental model (monthly rent, traditional lease terms) and the platform's native model (per-night pricing, partial-week schedules). This means: (1) Every price display should show both the per-night rate and the monthly equivalent for the guest's selected schedule (e.g., '$66/night = $1,056/month for your Mon-Thu schedule'). (2) Provide an explicit comparison frame: 'vs. a full-time lease at $2,500/month, you save $1,444/month.' (3) The schedule selector should show calendar views alongside night counts, so guests can see their actual days rather than abstract numbers. (4) When schedule changes affect price, show the monthly impact immediately, not just the per-night change.

Shomit's immediate reaction to learning about shared space is hedged acceptance: 'I mean, I guess that's fine. I mean, it doesn't really matter to me. Well, I guess that's fine.' The triple 'I guess' signals unresolved evaluation, not genuine acceptance. The current process addresses co-tenancy only verbally (on a phone call) and once (at the Zoom matching meeting). But the uncertainty re-emerges at every phase: during listing evaluation (what will the shared space feel like?), at move-in (evidence of the other person's presence), and during active lease (ongoing co-tenant dynamics). The platform treats co-tenancy as a one-time explanation rather than a persistent concern requiring structured resolution.",

This means: (1) During discovery, provide a clear visual or narrative explanation of the 'ghost roommate' concept with specific examples of how it works in practice. (2) On listing pages, include a dedicated section addressing the shared-space arrangement: what is shared, what is private, how transitions work, what cleanliness standards are maintained. (3) Before the Zoom co-tenant meeting, provide the guest with a preparation guide: what to expect, what to ask, what criteria to evaluate, and explicit reassurance that they can decline. (4) At move-in, include a co-tenancy FAQ in the arrival materials addressing the most common concerns (other person's belongings, cleaning, key handoff). (5) During active lease, provide a structured channel for co-tenant communication or concern escalation.

(3) At every waiting period, provide either a time estimate ('typical matching takes 5-7 days') or a status update mechanism (email/SMS when status changes).

      "problem": "The Split Lease model introduces a level of process complexity (co-tenancy, dynamic pricing, non-binding bids, Zoom matching, multi-week timeline) that may exceed the guest's readiness to engage. Shomit has extensive NYC rental experience, which means he has high general housing skills but zero Split Lease-specific skills. The current process dumps the full complexity at once during the phone call: co-tenancy explanation, pricing model, bid system, matching process, Zoom meeting, lease timeline. This violates Csikszentmihalyi's challenge-skill balance: when challenges exceed a person's perceived capacity to act, the result is anxiety, not engagement. Shomit's response pattern -- accepting information but refusing to act -- is a classic anxiety-zone behavior.",
      "solution": "Sequence the introduction of process complexity to match the guest's growing familiarity. This means: (1) During discovery, explain only the value proposition ('a furnished apartment for the nights you need, at a fraction of full-time rent') and one next step ('browse available properties'). Do not explain bids, matching, Zoom meetings, or co-tenancy in the first interaction. (2) During search, introduce dynamic pricing as the guest interacts with the schedule selector -- let them discover it through immediate feedback rather than verbal explanation. (3) Introduce the bid concept only after the guest has selected a preferred listing, when the action has a clear target. (4) Explain co-tenant matching and the Zoom meeting only after a bid is placed, when the guest is already invested and the next step is concrete. The principle: introduce each new process element only when the guest has the context and motivation to absorb it, never earlier.",
