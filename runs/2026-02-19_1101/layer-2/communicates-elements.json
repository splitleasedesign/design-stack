      "problem": "Guests arrive with a monthly-rent mental model built from years of traditional leasing. Shomit says 'I guess mainly I think of this per month and then I break it down per night' (line 65) and anchors his budget at 'below 2,500 a month' (line 68). The platform prices per night, forcing every guest to perform silent arithmetic at every listing touchpoint: $66/night x 4 nights x ~4.3 weeks = ?. This cognitive translation tax violates Csikszentmihalyi's immediate-feedback requirement. Instead of instantly knowing whether a listing fits their budget, the guest must compute — and computation is not feedback, it is work. The information architecture currently privileges the platform's internal pricing unit over the guest's native financial frame.",
      "solution": "Make the monthly equivalent the primary price display, with per-night rate as secondary detail. Every listing card, listing page, and search result must show: (1) the monthly cost for the guest's selected schedule as the largest, most prominent number; (2) a savings comparison against the guest's reference frame ('vs. $2,500/mo full-time lease: you save $1,444'); (3) the per-night rate as supporting detail below the monthly figure. When the guest adjusts nights or weeks, the monthly figure must update in real time with zero delay.",

          "insight": "The guest's budget framework is monthly. He explicitly describes translating from monthly to nightly — the platform forces him to work backward from his natural frame. Information architecture must present pricing in the guest's native unit first."

I mean, it doesn't really matter to me. Well, I guess that's fine' (line 19) — demonstrates surface acceptance masking unresolved uncertainty. The triple hedge ('I guess... I guess... I guess') is a linguistic marker of incomplete processing. Currently, co-tenancy is explained once on the initial call and again at the Zoom meeting weeks later. Between these two moments, the guest carries unresolved questions through search and listing evaluation with no structured information to address them.

(2) Listing evaluation: dedicated listing section showing what is shared, what is private, cleaning standards between transitions, storage for personal items. (3) Negotiation (Zoom prep): co-tenant profile summary, conversation guide with suggested questions, explicit statement that the guest can decline.

Yet the agent continues introducing more complexity (bids, matching, timeline) before resolving those concerns. Csikszentmihalyi's challenge-skill balance principle predicts the outcome: when process complexity exceeds the guest's current capacity to absorb it, the guest retreats to 'protective routines' — in Shomit's case, the repeated 'I'll hold off.'",
      "solution": "Architect each phase introduction to present exactly one new concept, with all supporting information structured to serve that single concept. (1) Discovery: only the value proposition — 'A furnished apartment for the nights you need, at a fraction of full-time rent.' No bids, no matching, no co-tenancy details. (2) Search: only the schedule-price relationship — 'Select your nights and see your monthly cost.' Introduce dynamic pricing through interaction, not explanation. (3) Proposal creation: only the expression of interest — 'Mark this property as one you want. This is not a commitment.' Introduce the bid concept only after the guest has selected a preferred listing. (4) Negotiation: only the co-tenant meeting — 'Meet the person who uses the space on different days. You decide if you are comfortable.' Introduce the Zoom meeting only after a match is confirmed.",

Despite the agent explaining three times that bids are non-binding (lines 34, 53-54, 59), Shomit refuses to place one. The information-level problem is not that the guest lacks knowledge (he understands the non-binding nature) but that the label 'bid' activates a mental model incompatible with the actual action. Csikszentmihalyi's paradox of control applies: the guest 'cannot experience a feeling of control unless one is willing to give up the safety of protective routines' (lines 727-728). The word 'bid' invokes a high-stakes frame that makes the protective routine ('I'll hold off') feel safer than acting.",
      "solution": "Replace 'bid' in all guest-facing information architecture with language that accurately reflects the non-binding, exploratory nature of the action. Recommended alternatives: 'Save this property,' 'Express interest,' or 'Add to my shortlist.' The action button, confirmation message, and all references to this step must use the same reframed language consistently. The information hierarchy around this action should emphasize: (1) what the action does NOT do (does not commit you, does not charge you, does not notify the landlord); (2) what it DOES do (saves the property to your list, starts the matching process if you choose to proceed); (3) how to undo it (you can remove it from your shortlist at any time).",
