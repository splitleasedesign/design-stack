This run's evidence: Shomit refuses to bid three times because he has not surveyed the decision landscape -- his System 1 flags the action request as premature. Kahneman's associative coherence (library) and Csikszentmihalyi's paradox of control (this run) converge: users need internal readiness (whether trust-based or information-based) before they will engage with a new process step.

This run's evidence: Shomit faces a 2-3 week process with no intermediate feedback, leading him to call it 'courtship.' Csikszentmihalyi's immediate feedback requirement (this run) reinforces Kahneman's conversational speed principle (library).

Both identify the same structural problem: a one-time explanation of a critical concept is insufficient when the concept's implications resurface at every subsequent phase.

This run's evidence: the agent promises 'you can play with that on the website and it will give you all options dynamically.' The guest expects game-like responsiveness.

The momentum emotion sustains the guest through the multi-week waiting period. The arc's primary weakness is thin coverage of move-in and active-lease phases, which is a data limitation (the source call is pre-lease) rather than a design flaw.
