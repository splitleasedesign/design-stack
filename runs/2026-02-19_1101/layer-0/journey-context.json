    "lens_summary": "This lens reveals how a pragmatic, cost-conscious guest navigating an unfamiliar shared-living model needs clear goals, immediate feedback, and a sense of control at every phase — precisely the conditions Csikszentmihalyi identifies as prerequisites for enjoyment and continued engagement — and how the absence of these conditions produces hesitation, deferral, and dropout risk."

    "discovery": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Shomit arrived through an ad, already knowing the location (Upper West Side) and rough schedule (six weeks, Monday through Friday). His discovery was externally triggered but immediately practical: he has a real housing need because he works in NYC part-time but cannot justify a full-time lease. The book extract illuminates that Shomit is not seeking pleasure (a comfortable hotel) but rather a structured solution that matches his life pattern. Csikszentmihalyi's distinction between pleasure and enjoyment maps directly: Shomit wants more than comfort — he wants a living arrangement that fits his specific work rhythm without overpaying. The discovery phase works when the external trigger (the ad) connects to a felt need and creates enough clarity to move forward. Shomit's immediate engagement on the call shows the ad successfully created a clear initial goal.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional_state": "Pragmatically curious but not urgent. Shomit is exploring options, not desperate. He speaks in measured terms: 'six weeks is like, uh, cause that's what I know for now. Right. And then maybe more after that.' (line 4). There is openness without commitment.",
        "knowledge_level": "Shomit knows the basic proposition (a furnished apartment, weekly schedule) but does not understand the Split Lease model (co-tenancy, bid system, matching). He treats this as a standard short-term rental inquiry until the agent explains otherwise.",
        "commitment_level": "Browsing with intent. He responded to an ad and is on a call, which indicates real interest, but he has no platform account and has not seen any listings yet.",
        "data_available": "Location preference (Upper West Side but open to other areas), schedule (six weeks starting soon, four nights Monday-Thursday), rough budget anchor ($2,500/month full lease as reference point), contact information (email shared on call)."

          "Shomit has an immediate need (arriving April 15) that Split Lease explicitly cannot serve ('this is not that opportunity' — line 27). This gap between immediate need and available timeline may cause him to solve his problem elsewhere and never return.",
          "He has existing mental models from long experience renting in NYC ('I've had many leases I've rented in New York for a long time' — line 67) that may make the Split Lease model feel unnecessarily complex."

        "evidence": "Shomit says: 'All of this sounds good. Right? I mean, it doesn't solve my question for next week, but that's fine.' (line 38). The 'but that's fine' signals acceptance of the limitation, but also reveals that his most pressing need is unmet. Csikszentmihalyi: 'Activities that provide enjoyment are often those that have been designed for this very purpose' (line 329-330) — if the discovery experience feels like it was not designed to serve Shomit's actual situation, engagement drops."

The book extract's concept of challenge-skill balance is directly relevant: the search interface must present an appropriate level of complexity. Too many options without filters will overwhelm (anxiety); too few options or an opaque system will bore or frustrate. The agent's promise that the website will let him 'play with' options dynamically (line 49) sets up an expectation of interactive, feedback-rich search — exactly what Csikszentmihalyi prescribes for maintaining engagement.",

His evaluation criteria are pragmatic: location, price, schedule compatibility. Csikszentmihalyi's insight about feedback is critical here — the listing page is where the guest must receive clear feedback on whether this property matches their needs.

Csikszentmihalyi: 'unless a person learns to set goals and to recognize and gauge feedback in such activities, she will not enjoy them.' (line 514-515). If the listing page does not provide clear feedback about the co-tenancy arrangement, guests cannot fully evaluate and will not enjoy (engage with) the process."

The book extract explains why: Csikszentmihalyi's paradox of control states that people enjoy 'not the sense of being in control, but the sense of exercising control in difficult situations' (line 725-726). Shomit does not yet feel he has enough information to exercise control over his decision. Placing a bid — even a non-binding one — feels like surrendering control before he has mapped the decision landscape.

At the acceptance phase, the guest's motivation shifts from exotelic (solving a housing problem) to potentially autotelic (actually wanting to live in this specific place with this arrangement).

The active lease phase is where the guest's daily experience either becomes enjoyable (producing retention) or merely pleasant at best (producing eventual churn). The key insight: Split Lease must design the active lease experience to provide ongoing challenges matched to skills, clear goals, immediate feedback, and a sense of control — the elements of flow.

During active lease, co-tenant dynamics continue to be a source of potential friction.

He anchors his budget and expectations to traditional renting, then must mentally translate to Split Lease's per-night, partial-week pricing model. The agent must do this translation on the call (line 8: '$66 per night'). If the platform does not provide the same translation (monthly equivalent, comparison to alternatives), the guest must do cognitive work at every phase that the platform should do for them. Csikszentmihalyi: 'it would be a mistake to assume that only art and leisure can provide optimal experiences... one purpose of this book is to explore ways in which even routine details can be transformed into personally meaningful games' (lines 332-336).
