      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation"],
      "problem": "The host arrives in discovery still in full possession of their instinctual freedom over their space. They have surrendered nothing. Freud Ch III identifies that 'our so-called civilization itself is to blame for a great part of our misery, and we should be much happier if we were to give it up and go back to primitive conditions.' The host in discovery is in those primitive conditions: autonomous, unobligated, uncommitted. Any premature demand -- registration forms, identity requests, property details -- violates the pleasure principle by imposing civilizational cost before any civilizational benefit has been demonstrated. The emotional challenge is that the platform must attract the host without triggering the instinctual alarm that says 'this system wants to take something from me.' The user stories confirm: 'Any flow that requires users to give information before seeing results will lose most of them.' The host's dominant emotion here is guarded curiosity -- they are drawn by the possibility of income but wary of what surrendering their space actually means.",
      "solution": "The platform must feel like a window, not a door. Discovery should deliver value -- market demand signals, earnings estimates, neighborhood context -- without asking the host to step through any threshold. The emotional tone is generous demonstration: 'Here is what your space could earn. Here is who is looking. Here is how it works.' No registration wall. No forms. No identity requests. The copy must acknowledge the host's autonomy ('Your space, your terms') while gently surfacing the civilizational benefit ('Hosts in your area earn $X/month with vetted, working professionals'). The emotional arc of discovery is: curiosity validated, not curiosity taxed.",

Freud Ch III describes how 'the members of the community have restricted their possibilities of gratification, whereas the individual recognized no such restrictions.' The host is transitioning from individual freedom to community membership. The emotional challenge is that the warm human connection from the evaluation call (with the agent) is about to be replaced by cold platform mechanics -- forms, verification steps, terms acceptance. Freud identifies an 'element of disappointment' when civilization's promises do not match its experience. If the agent call felt personal and easy, and the onboarding feels impersonal and bureaucratic, the host experiences this gap as civilizational betrayal. The dominant emotion must be reassured continuity -- the feeling that the agent is still present even as the platform takes over.",
      "solution": "The onboarding experience must feel like a continuation of the agent conversation, not a handoff to a system. The agent's name and photo should be the first thing the host sees.

      "problem": "Listing creation is the peak of instinctual renunciation. The host is converting their private space -- their home, their rooms, their intimate domestic environment -- into a public marketplace artifact. Photos of their bedroom. Descriptions of their amenities. Rules for strangers who will live in their space. Each wizard step demands a deeper surrender of the host's private domain. Freud Ch III: 'it is impossible to ignore the extent to which civilization is built up on renunciation of instinctual gratifications... This cultural privation dominates the whole field of social relations.' The emotional challenge is that the platform treats this as a task (fill out 6 steps) when it is actually a sacrifice (convert something intimate into something transactable). Hosts who stall at listing creation are not lazy or confused -- they are experiencing the peak psychological cost of the entire journey. The user stories confirm: 'Completion percentage is a good host nudge' and 'Pause matters more than delete.' Both acknowledge that listing creation demands emotional management, not just task management.",
      "solution": "The listing wizard must treat each step as a dignified exchange, not a form submission. Before each disclosure (photos, descriptions, rules), the platform should acknowledge what the host is giving and show what they will receive. Before the photo step: 'Great photos help vetted professionals find your space -- hosts with 4+ photos get proposals 3x faster.' Before the rules step: 'Your house rules are enforced by the platform. Guests agree to them before they can propose.' The emotional arc is: each surrender is met with an explicit promise that the civilization will honor the sacrifice. The completion indicator is not just a progress bar -- it is a narrative of civilizational investment: 'You have built 67% of your listing. Everything you have entered is saved and ready.' Pause must be frictionless and guilt-free. The tone when a host pauses should be: 'Your listing is saved exactly as you left it. Come back whenever you are ready.'",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "When a guest submits a proposal, the host confronts the primal anxiety that Freud identifies in Ch V: 'men are not gentle, friendly creatures wishing for love... but that a powerful measure of desire for aggression has to be reckoned as part of their instinctual endowment. The result is that their neighbour is to them not only a possible helper or sexual object, but also a temptation to them to gratify their aggressiveness on him.' Every proposal is from a stranger seeking entry to the host's private domain. The host's instinct is distrust. The emotional challenge is not to eliminate this distrust (it is instinctually legitimate) but to transform it from diffuse anxiety into focused, confident assessment. A host who feels anxious about a stranger will freeze or decline. A host who feels equipped to evaluate a stranger will decide with confidence. The user stories confirm: 'A well-structured proposal activates the host to respond. A vague or incomplete one creates friction.'",
      "solution": "The proposal experience must convert the host's anxiety into agency. The emotional arc is: alarm (new proposal notification) to assessment (scanning trust signals) to decision (confident accept, counter, or decline). The trust signals must arrive before the terms: the guest's verification status, completed leases, review rating, and stated reason for their stay. The copy around the proposal must frame the host as the decision-maker, not the recipient: 'You have a new proposal. Here is what you need to know about this guest.' The counter-proposal mechanism must feel like negotiation, not confrontation: 'Adjust the terms to fit your needs' rather than 'Decline and counter.'

Freud Ch V warns: 'Civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another.' The host's anxiety does not resolve when the lease is signed -- it recurs with every stay cycle. Every week the guest occupies the space, the host must re-manage their instinctual anxiety: Is my space being respected? Is the guest following the rules? Are the cleaning standards being maintained? Without structured reassurance mechanisms, this anxiety accumulates silently. A week without a cleaning photo becomes 'the guest is not taking care of my space.' Three days without communication becomes 'something is wrong.' The emotional challenge is that the absence of information is experienced as a threat signal. Freud identifies the solution as 'order: a kind of repetition-compulsion by which it is ordained once for all when, where and how a thing shall be done so that on every similar occasion doubt and hesitation shall be avoided.'",
      "solution": "The active lease must feel like a well-run household with a predictable rhythm, not like an ongoing uncertainty. The emotional design centers on ritual confirmation: arrival notification, cleaning photos, micro-review -- the same three beats, in the same order, at the same time relative to each stay cycle. The host should never wonder 'should I check on things?' because the system brings the confirmation to them. When rituals are completed (cleaning photos submitted, arrival confirmed), the emotional register is quiet satisfaction: 'All clear. Your space is in good hands.' When rituals are delayed, the register is neutral informational: 'Cleaning photos pending -- we have reminded your guest.' The platform handles the follow-up; the host never chases. The cumulative effect is that over 13+ weekly stays, the rhythm becomes internalized: the host stops worrying because the ritual has never failed them.",

The host experiences these as constraints on their autonomy -- 'I cannot change dates without asking.' Freud Ch III identifies the 'first requisite of culture' as 'justice -- that is, the assurance that a law once made will not be broken in favour of any individual.' But justice is only perceived as justice when both sides of the constraint are visible. A host who sees only their own constraint ('you must wait for approval') experiences oppression. A host who sees both sides simultaneously ('the guest also cannot change dates without your approval') experiences protection. The emotional challenge is that platform rules, presented one-sidedly, activate the host's instinctual revolt against civilization. L1 (works-006) prescribes making mediation feel like justice; L3 (looks-007) prescribes the visual protection surface. The feels layer must define the emotional register that makes these constraints feel like mutual safety.",
      "solution": "Every platform rule must be presented with an emotional frame that leads with protection before revealing constraint. The emotional sequence is: (1) 'You are protected' (safety first), (2) 'Here is how -- this rule applies equally to both of you' (justice visible), (3) 'What would you like to do?' (agency preserved). The copy must never lead with the restriction. The tone must be steady and warm -- the voice of a fair referee, not a bureaucratic gatekeeper. When the host encounters a constraint, the first thing they should feel is: 'this system has my back.' The emotional arc over time: after encountering 3-4 constraint surfaces that consistently lead with protection, the host develops a Pavlovian trust response to the warm purple protection surface (L3 looks-007). The platform's rules begin to feel like a shield rather than a cage.",

      "journey_phases": ["retention"],
      "problem": "Retention is where the host's entire civilizational participation is retroactively evaluated. Freud Ch V introduces 'the narcissism of minor differences' -- the psychological tendency to anchor on small, proximate grievances rather than large, cumulative benefits. A host who earned $12,000 across 12 successful stays but had one difficult week will, in retrospect, disproportionately weight the difficult week. The emotional challenge is that the host's natural memory architecture favors negative exceptions over positive patterns. Without a structured counter-narrative, the retrospective assessment defaults to dissatisfaction. The user stories document's principle about Pause vs. Delete applies: the host who pauses is psychologically closer to re-entry than the one who deletes. But neither Pause nor Delete addresses the core emotional problem: the host must feel, at the moment of the retention decision, that their civilizational participation was net-positive. The weakest phase in the library (44 mentions vs. 152 for active lease), retention is where emotional design has the most untapped leverage.",
      "solution": "The retention moment must be designed as a celebration of cumulative achievement, not a decision about future commitment. Before the host sees any prompt to re-list, they should see their full hosting record presented as a narrative of civilizational worth: total earnings (large, in the evidence register), successful stays, average rating, hosting tenure. The emotional arc is: reflection (see what you built) to recognition (this was a meaningful achievement) to continuation (keep building). The re-listing CTA must use continuation language ('Continue Hosting') not restart language ('Create New Listing'). The emotional design must counteract Freud's narcissism of minor differences by embedding any negative memory within the larger positive pattern. A single bad stay in the context of '$12,000 earned across 12 successful stays' feels like an exception, not the rule. The key emotional insight: do not ask the host 'do you want to host again?' Ask them 'look at what you have built -- do you want to keep building?'",
