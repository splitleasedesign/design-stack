      "problem": "When a host accepts a proposal or confirms a stay, they are performing what Freud would call a civilizational act -- voluntarily surrendering instinctual autonomy (control over their space) in exchange for marketplace security (guaranteed income, vetted guest). These are the highest-value, most psychologically costly actions in the journey. Yet the platform treats them with the same interaction latency as any other action: submit, wait for server, show spinner, return confirmation. This delay introduces doubt at exactly the moment the host has overcome their instinctual resistance. Freud Ch III identifies that 'order is a kind of repetition-compulsion by which it is ordained once for all when, where and how a thing shall be done so that on every similar occasion doubt and hesitation shall be avoided.' A spinner after a civilizational commitment reintroduces the doubt that the host just resolved. The user stories document confirms that 'a well-structured proposal activates the host to respond' -- but activation is wasted if the response moment itself creates friction.",
      "solution": "Use optimistic UI for all civilizational acts: the moment the host taps Accept Proposal, Confirm Stay, or Approve Date Change, the interface immediately transitions to the success state. The server round-trip happens in the background. The host sees confirmation before the server confirms, because the psychological need for immediate reinforcement of a costly decision outweighs the small risk of a rollback. If the server fails (rare), the UI gracefully reverts with a protective explanation ('We could not complete this right now -- your space is still protected, nothing has changed'). The optimistic commit transforms the interaction from 'submit and hope' to 'decide and done,' which mirrors the conversational speed of the phone call (L1, works-003) and provides the immediate feedback loop that civilization requires to reinforce compliance.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_creation", "active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "When a host pauses a listing, declines a proposal, or deletes their account, they are performing what Freud would call an instinctual act -- reasserting autonomy over their private space, retreating from civilizational participation. The user stories document identifies that 'Pause matters more than delete. Hosts who stop a listing aren't always done with it. Pause preserves the work, keeps the door open, and costs nothing. Delete is a one-way door that creates regret.' Freud distinguishes two origins of the desire for freedom: civilized revolt against a specific injustice (the host had a bad guest) and primitive instinctual need for autonomy (the host simply wants their space back). The interaction pattern must accommodate both without making either feel punished. Currently, destructive actions (decline, delete, deactivate) use the same interaction speed and confirmation pattern as constructive ones. This is wrong: a host who impulsively deletes a listing they spent 45 minutes creating suffers disproportionate loss. The interaction for instinctual acts must be cautious -- not to prevent the host from acting, but to ensure the action reflects their settled intention rather than a momentary impulse.",
      "solution": "Design instinctual acts (pause, decline, delete, deactivate) with a graduated friction pattern that increases proportionally to the irreversibility of the action. (1) Pause (fully reversible): single action, no confirmation dialog. The listing disappears from the marketplace immediately but remains fully preserved on the host's dashboard. One-tap reactivation. The interaction feels like closing a door, not locking it. (2) Decline (partially reversible -- the host can message the guest later but the specific proposal terms are gone): a brief confirmation surface using the bidirectional protection frame (L3, looks-007). The surface shows what declining means ('This proposal will be removed. You can still message [Guest Name] if you change your mind.') and what it does not mean ('Your listing remains active for other guests.'). (3) Delete (irreversible): a two-step confirmation with a 5-second cool-down. Step 1 shows what will be permanently lost (photos, descriptions, reviews, earnings history associated with this listing). Step 2 requires the host to wait 5 seconds before the Delete button becomes active, giving the impulse time to subside. The cool-down is not punitive -- it is Freud's insight that 'the desire for freedom may have its origin in the primitive roots of the personality' and the platform's job is to ensure the host is acting from their civilized self, not their impulsive self.",

          "insight": "The interaction pattern must distinguish between these two origins without interrogating the host. The graduated friction achieves this structurally: reversible actions (pause) need no friction because they accommodate both motives; irreversible actions (delete) need friction because only one motive (settled, civilized decision) should lead to permanent loss."

Freud identifies that civilization produces an 'element of disappointment' when its promises fail to deliver: 'Mankind is proud of its exploits and has a right to be. But men are beginning to perceive that all this newly won power... has not increased the amount of pleasure they can obtain in life.' Every platform error -- a failed upload, a validation rejection, a server timeout -- is a micro-disappointment that confirms the host's unconscious suspicion that civilization (the platform) is not worth the instinctual sacrifice. Current error patterns across most platforms use red text, exclamation marks, and blame-adjacent language ('Invalid input', 'Upload failed', 'Something went wrong'). These patterns punish the host for the platform's failure and activate the aggressive instinct Freud identifies: 'their neighbour is to them not only a possible helper... but also a temptation to them to gratify their aggressiveness on him.' An error that feels punitive turns the host's aggression toward the platform itself.",

This addresses the deepest anxiety -- that the error destroyed their civilizational investment. (3) Offer a clear path forward: a single, specific next action. 'Try uploading the photo again' or 'Refresh to reconnect.' Never present multiple error-recovery options that create a new decision at a moment of frustration. The visual treatment uses amber urgency (L3, looks-004), not red. The tone uses the reassurance typographic register.

During the active lease, this hostility manifests as the host's recurring anxiety: Is my space being respected? Is the guest following the rules? Each stay cycle (weekly for most leases) is a renewal of the civilizational contract. L1 (works-004) prescribes repetitive rituals (arrival confirmation, cleaning photos, micro-reviews). L2 (communicates-005) prescribes a three-signal information cadence. L3 (looks-005) prescribes a fixed visual grid. But none of these layers define how the host interacts with these rituals -- the behavioral layer. The interaction problem is: the rituals must feel automatic and predictable to the host (Freud's 'order as repetition-compulsion') while requiring minimal effort. If the host must actively check for each ritual completion, the rituals become a new source of anxiety rather than a remedy for it. If the rituals are purely passive (push notifications only), the host has no sense of agency over the monitoring process.",
      "solution": "Design the stay cycle interaction as a three-beat rhythm that the host learns after the first two cycles and can rely on for the duration of the lease. Beat 1 -- Arrival Signal: when the guest confirms arrival through the Stays Manager, the host's dashboard automatically updates the current stay card to 'In Progress' with the guest's confirmed dates. No host action required. A subtle notification (badge update, not a push alert) signals that the cycle has started. Beat 2 -- Departure + Cleaning: when the guest submits cleaning photos at departure, the stay card updates to show a 2x2 photo thumbnail grid. The host can tap any thumbnail to enlarge. The interaction is: glance (under 3 seconds to confirm cleanliness) or inspect (tap to zoom for detail). No action required unless the host wants to flag an issue, in which case a single 'Flag for review' text link appears below the grid. Beat 3 -- Cycle Close: 24 hours after departure, the stay card prompts a one-tap micro-review. The interaction is a single row of 5 icons (representing aspects like cleanliness, communication, rule compliance, timing, overall) that the host taps to rate. Total interaction time: under 10 seconds. The micro-review is optional but the prompt is consistent -- it appears at the same time after every stay, creating the repetition-compulsion Freud describes. The three beats always occur in the same order, at the same relative times, on the same surface (the stay card within the dashboard). The host never needs to navigate to find them.",

Currently, a host who completes 4 of 6 steps and closes the browser loses their session state. When they return, they face two possible failures: (1) they restart from step 1, which wastes their prior civilizational investment and produces Freud's 'serious disorders' from uncompensated deprivation, or (2) they land on an ambiguous state that does not clearly show what was completed and what remains. Both outcomes punish the host for the natural human need to take breaks from sustained instinctual renunciation.

The host never needs to click a Save button -- the concept of saving does not exist as an action because it is the default behavior. (2) Resume exactly: when the host returns (hours, days, or weeks later), they land on the exact step and field where they left off. Completed steps show green checks in the progress indicator. The current step shows their partial input restored. The host's first impression on return is: 'everything I did is here, and I am exactly where I stopped.' This is Freud's 'order' applied to the resume experience: predictable, reliable, no doubt about the state. (3) Completion percentage on the dashboard: the listing card on the host's dashboard shows a progress bar (e.g., '4 of 6 steps complete -- 67%'). This serves as both a reminder and a motivator.

But the interaction behavior -- how the host encounters and acknowledges these constraints -- determines whether the host's experience is 'I am being protected' or 'I am being controlled.' The critical insight: a confirmation dialog is not just a UI pattern, it is a moment where the host confronts the limits of their autonomy within the civilizational framework.

(2) Bidirectional explanation: two parallel statements showing the reciprocal constraint ('The guest cannot change dates without your approval' / 'You also cannot change dates without the guest's agreement'). These are rendered in identical typographic treatment to make the bidirectionality visually self-evident. (3) Single primary action: one button for the intended action ('Confirm date change request') with a secondary text link for the alternative ('Cancel'). No third option. The surface uses the protection visual pattern (L3, looks-007): warm purple-tinted background, shield icon, rounded container. The host should be able to read, understand, and act on the surface in under 8 seconds.

        "error": "If reactivation fails: 'Your listing could not be reactivated right now. All your data is preserved. Try again in a moment, or contact [agent name].' The Hosting Summary remains visible through the error -- the host's cumulative evidence is never hidden.",
        "success": "After tapping 'Continue Hosting': the lease-end card transforms into the reactivated listing card with a brief celebration animation (a subtle purple pulse around the card border, 500ms). The card shows: 'Your listing is live again. Guests can find and propose to your space.' The Hosting Summary metrics persist on the card as a compact footer, reminding the host of their cumulative record."

      "transition_principle": "The retention re-entry should feel like reopening a book you set down, not picking up a new one. The lease-end card's transformation into the reactivated listing card uses a smooth morph animation (card dimensions adjust, content cross-fades, 400ms ease-in-out) that communicates continuity. The host sees the same card in the same position on the dashboard, with updated content. Nothing moves, nothing navigates, nothing reloads.",

'Continue Hosting' tap to reactivation: 0ms perceived (optimistic). Marketplace re-indexing: within 15 minutes (background).",
        "easing": "Card transformation: ease-in-out, 400ms morph. Purple celebration pulse: ease-out, 500ms. Hosting Summary metrics entrance: staggered fade-in, 100ms per metric, starting from the largest (total earnings).",
        "rationale": "The 24-hour delay before the retention prompt respects the host's emotional state at lease end. Freud's 'retrospective weighing' needs time. The host should not be asked to re-commit while still processing the experience of the completed lease. After the delay, the one-action path must be instant to capitalize on the positive retrospective assessment that the Hosting Summary supports."

      "journey_state_awareness": "For hosts completing their first lease: the retention card includes a congratulatory message: 'You completed your first lease. [X] earned, [Y] successful stays.' This marks the civilizational milestone. For experienced hosts (2+ leases): the card shows growth trajectory: 'Your [Nth] lease. You have earned [total] across [total stays] stays.' For hosts whose last lease had issues (disputes, low reviews): the retention card leads with 'What we have improved for your next guest' rather than metrics, addressing the specific grievance before asking for re-commitment.",

        "Host does not act on the retention card for 30+ days: the card persists in the action-required zone but does not escalate. After 30 days, a single gentle notification (email or push): 'Your listing is ready whenever you are. All your data is preserved.' No urgency language, no countdown timers.",
        "Host wants to host in a different property: the 'Continue Hosting' path reactivates the existing listing. A secondary option: 'Host a different space' opens the wizard for a new listing. Both options are visible, but 'Continue Hosting' is the primary CTA.",
        "Host's listing data has become outdated (photos are 18 months old, amenities changed): after reactivation, the dashboard shows a gentle prompt: 'Your listing was last updated [date]. Would you like to review your photos and details?' This is a suggestion, not a requirement -- the listing is already active.",
        "Multiple listings ending simultaneously: each listing gets its own retention card, sorted by most recent lease-end date. The Hosting Summary shows aggregate metrics across all listings.",
        "Host re-enters and immediately receives a proposal: the transition from retention to proposal_mgmt should feel seamless. The reactivated listing card can show a new proposal badge within minutes of reactivation."
