      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Discovery is the moment before renunciation begins — the host is still in a state of instinctual freedom regarding their space. Freud's Ch III identifies three sources of suffering: nature, the body, and human relationships. For hosts, the third source is the one that matters: the anxiety of inviting strangers into their private domain. The user stories document reveals that 'value before the ask — always' is the governing principle: hosts must see something useful before they give anything up. Freud explains why: any request for information or commitment before demonstrating value activates the pain of premature renunciation. The host has not yet agreed to civilize their private space. Asking them to register, fill forms, or declare intentions before showing value violates the pleasure principle — it imposes cost before any possibility of reward. The existing library (works-004) addresses the human-to-digital handoff, but this lens reveals a deeper layer: the host in discovery is not just evaluating a platform, they are unconsciously assessing whether this civilization (the marketplace) is worth the instinctual sacrifice it demands.",

The user stories analysis highlights two critical evaluation signals: 'Verified reviews and host credibility signals activate guests' and 'Messaging before proposals is a natural step.' Inverted for the host perspective, this means the host is evaluating whether the platform provides sufficient structure to make the civilizing sacrifice safe. Freud's insight that 'civilized man has exchanged some part of his chances of happiness for a measure of security' is the exact transaction the host is evaluating: will Split Lease provide enough security to justify surrendering control? The cross-activation framework from the user stories ('an experienced guest applying to a new host is cross-activation in action') reveals that evaluation is not just host-to-platform but host-to-marketplace: the host needs evidence that the other participants in this civilization are trustworthy.",

The host is creating an account (submitting identity to the system), accepting terms (agreeing to platform rules), and entering personal information (surrendering privacy). The user stories document's principle that 'authentication should be invisible until it matters' is a direct Freudian insight: the civilizational demand should be hidden until the host is already engaged enough that the cost of withdrawal exceeds the cost of compliance. The journey map shows onboarding involves a 'first call' with the agent — this is Freud's mediating mechanism: civilization uses human identification (the agent as a relatable figure) to ease the pain of instinctual renunciation. The existing library (works-004, Bridge Human Trust to Digital Trust) addresses this handoff, but the Freud lens adds: the agent is not just bridging trust, they are performing the role of the 'leader' who makes civilizational sacrifice tolerable through personal identification.",

Freud Ch III notes that civilization demands 'beauty, cleanliness and order' — the listing wizard is literally demanding these: beautiful photos, clean descriptions, ordered specifications. The user stories document identifies two critical mechanisms: 'Completion percentage is a good host nudge' and 'Pause matters more than delete.' The completion percentage is Freud's 'repetition-compulsion of order' applied as motivation — it quantifies how much of the civilizing process remains. Pause vs. delete is the Freudian insight about reversibility: a host who can pause (temporarily retreat from civilization) will tolerate more renunciation than one who faces only the binary of full compliance or total loss. The 6-step wizard in the journey map (Space Snapshot, Features, Lease Styles, Pricing, Rules, Photos) represents a graduated sequence of increasingly intimate disclosures.

The host's instinctual valuation of their space (what it means to them, what it cost them, what it represents) must be compressed into a nightly rate. The journey map shows pricing as Step 4 of the wizard, with 'default values already populated.' The user stories analysis does not address pricing directly, which is itself a signal: pricing is so loaded with instinctual anxiety that even the analysis avoids it. Freud's framework explains why: setting a price on one's private space is a form of sublimation — the instinct to protect and hoard the space must be transformed into an economic transaction. Smart defaults (from the existing library, works-002) serve as the platform's civilizational guidance: they tell the host 'this is what the civilization considers fair' without requiring the host to perform the painful calculation themselves.

This is the deep anxiety beneath every proposal review: the host must evaluate whether this stranger will respect their space or violate it. The user stories document identifies that 'the proposal itself is a cross-activation event' and that 'a well-structured proposal activates the host to respond.' Freud explains the mechanism: a structured proposal reduces the perceived aggression potential of the stranger by demonstrating civilized behavior (clear dates, schedule, pricing, intent). The guest who submits a well-formed proposal is performing civilizational compliance, which signals to the host that this person has already submitted to the same renunciations the host has accepted. The journey map shows the host can counter-propose (changing duration from 16 to 10 weeks) — this is the host exercising what remains of their instinctual freedom within the civilizational framework. The counter-proposal is a controlled assertion of autonomy: 'I accept this stranger, but on my terms.'

      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Active lease is the phase of sustained civilizational coexistence. The stranger is now in the host's space. Freud Ch V describes how 'civilization is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another' — the active lease period is the ongoing test of whether the civilizational structure (the lease agreement, the platform's rules, the Stays Manager) can contain the instinctual tensions between two people sharing a space. The journey map details the mechanisms of civilized coexistence: Stays Manager (date changes), cleaning photos, reviews, the House Manual. Each is a civilizational tool — a way to channel potential conflict into structured interaction. The user stories analysis does not directly address active lease mechanics but its core messaging insight applies: 'Messaging before proposals is a natural step... the park analogy holds — you check availability before committing.' During active lease, the park analogy extends to every micro-interaction: the guest notifies arrival before appearing, sends cleaning photos before departing. These are civilizational rituals — structured behaviors that reduce the host's instinctual anxiety about the stranger in their space. The existing library has strong active_lease coverage (152 mentions), but the Freud lens adds the interpretive framework: these mechanisms work because they satisfy the host's need for 'order' — Freud's 'repetition-compulsion by which it is ordained once for all when, where and how a thing shall be done so that on every similar occasion doubt and hesitation shall be avoided.'",

Freud Ch V: 'civilized man has exchanged some part of his chances of happiness for a measure of security' — the active lease is where that security is delivered."

    "retention": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Retention is the phase where the host decides whether to re-enter civilization or return to 'primitive conditions.' Freud Ch III frames this as the recurring question: 'we should be much happier if we were to give it up and go back to primitive conditions.' A host whose lease has ended stands at this exact fork: re-list (accept another round of instinctual renunciation for civilizational rewards) or withdraw (reclaim full autonomy over their space). The user stories document's insight about Pause vs. Delete maps directly: 'Pause preserves the work, keeps the door open, and costs nothing' — for retention, the equivalent is making re-entry effortless. A host who must rebuild their listing from scratch faces the full renunciation cost again, which Freud would predict deters return. A host who can reactivate an existing listing faces only the marginal cost of accepting a new stranger. Freud Ch V introduces 'the narcissism of minor differences' — a concept that illuminates retention failure: hosts who leave do not necessarily leave because of a major grievance but because of accumulated small irritations that crystallize into a narrative of civilizational dissatisfaction. The existing library has the weakest coverage here (44 mentions), making retention a significant gap. The Freud lens reveals why: retention is not about features or UX — it is about the host's deep psychological calculation of whether civilizational participation was worth the instinctual cost. This calculation happens outside the platform, in the host's subjective experience of the entire journey.",

        "emotional_state": "Retrospective weighing. The host is evaluating the entire experience: was the income worth the sacrifice of privacy? Was the guest tolerable? Did the platform protect them?

The subjective experience of civilizational participation determines retention, not the objective outcome.",

Freud Ch V: 'It is always possible to unite considerable numbers of men in love towards one another, so long as there are still some remaining as objects for aggressive manifestations' — a host community (referral programs, host forums, shared identity) could channel the aggressive residue of the hosting experience into outgroup comparison rather than platform rejection."

The journey map shows this at every interaction: confirmation dialogs ('Yes, Proceed'), the counter-proposal mechanism, the date change approval flow, per-stay reviews. Each is a mechanism of 'justice' — ensuring neither host nor guest can unilaterally violate the shared agreement. The user stories document's emphasis on structured proposals and pre-populated forms extends this: even the proposal format enforces civilizational standards on the guest, which protects the host. When this mediation fails (disputes, unresponsive guests, broken rules), the host experiences Freud's 'disappointment of civilization' and is more likely to exit at retention."

The platform's review system, verified profiles, and guest history are mechanisms of identification: they allow the host to see the guest not as a threatening stranger but as a fellow participant in the civilizational order. Each positive review is evidence that the civilization works — that the renunciation is worthwhile."

But it may also have its origin in the primitive roots of the personality, still unfettered by civilizing influences.' Pause accommodates both types of freedom desire: the host who pauses due to a specific grievance (civilized revolt) and the host who pauses due to instinctual need for autonomy (primitive roots). In both cases, preserving the option to return — without the full cost of re-creation — keeps the host within the civilizational orbit. Delete is the platform forcing a binary that Freud would predict drives permanent exit."
