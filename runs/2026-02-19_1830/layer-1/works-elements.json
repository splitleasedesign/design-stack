      "problem": "The host journey demands an escalating series of surrenders: identity disclosure at onboarding, private space codification at listing creation, emotional valuation at pricing, stranger admission at proposal management. But the platform presents these demands without regard for the cumulative psychological cost. A host in discovery has surrendered nothing; a host mid-listing-creation has surrendered identity, time, and is now converting intimate domestic space into a public marketplace artifact. When the platform treats each phase as an isolated task rather than as a position on a renunciation gradient, it underestimates the felt cost at later stages and overestimates the host's willingness to comply. The result is that dropout clusters at listing creation (the steepest point on the gradient), not because the task is technically difficult, but because the accumulated instinctual sacrifice peaks there.",
      "solution": "Design the phase sequence so that the magnitude of each renunciation is matched by a proportional value delivery immediately preceding or accompanying it. Early phases should demand almost nothing (discovery shows value without requiring sign-up; evaluation demonstrates security before asking for commitment). Each subsequent phase should open with a concrete demonstration of what the prior renunciation purchased: onboarding shows the agent who will protect the host's interests; listing creation shows demand signals or comparable earnings before asking for photos; pricing shows what similar hosts earn before asking for a rate. The pattern is: at every step up the gradient, deliver a tangible civilizational benefit that justifies the next instinctual cost. Never allow two consecutive phases to demand without delivering.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_creation", "active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "Freud identifies two distinct origins of the desire for freedom: one is a civilized revolt against a specific injustice (a host who pauses because a guest was problematic), and the other is a primitive instinctual need for autonomy (a host who simply wants their space back). The platform currently treats both the same way: the host can delete their listing (permanent) or leave silently (no mechanism for return). This binary forces every expression of freedom into a permanent exit. A host who experiences a momentary instinctual need for autonomy -- who simply wants to stop for a while -- is forced to either endure the discomfort or make it permanent. Freud predicts that forced permanence converts temporary resistance into lasting antagonism. The user stories document confirms this: 'Pause preserves the work, keeps the door open, and costs nothing. Delete is a one-way door that creates regret.'",
      "solution": "Build reversibility into every phase where the host has made significant investment. The core mechanism is the Pause state: a listing that is invisible to the marketplace but fully preserved on the host's side, reactivatable without rebuilding. But the principle extends beyond listings. (1) At listing creation: allow saving an incomplete wizard at any step, with one-click resumption. (2) At active lease: allow hosts to signal they will not re-list after the current lease ends, without canceling the current lease or losing their listing data. (3) At retention: make reactivation as close to a single action as possible. The host who paused six months ago should be able to return and find everything as they left it. The psychological mechanism: reversibility reduces the felt cost of every renunciation because the host knows they can reclaim their instinctual freedom without losing what they have already built. The civilizational contract becomes tolerable when it is not a trap.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_mgmt", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Freud's Ch V observation that 'men are not gentle, friendly creatures' but carry 'a powerful measure of desire for aggression' describes the host's unconscious calculus when reviewing a guest proposal. Every proposal is from a stranger seeking entry to the host's private domain. The host's instinct is to distrust. The user stories document identifies that 'a well-structured proposal activates the host to respond' while 'a vague or incomplete one creates friction.' The mechanism is deeper than UX convenience: a well-structured proposal demonstrates that the guest has already submitted to the marketplace's civilizational rules (clear dates, explicit schedule, declared pricing intent). A vague proposal signals that the stranger has not yet renounced their instinctual chaos for marketplace order -- and therefore cannot be trusted with the host's space. The current platform allows proposals of varying structure quality, which means some proposals trigger the host's instinctual distrust rather than alleviating it.",
      "solution": "Design the proposal system so that every proposal arrives pre-structured to demonstrate the guest's civilizational compliance. (1) Pre-populate proposal fields from the listing's own terms: dates, pricing, lease style. The guest confirms or adjusts, but cannot submit a blank or vague proposal. (2) Surface the guest's platform history prominently: completed leases, reviews received, verification status. Each of these is evidence that the guest has previously submitted to civilizational rules and honored them. (3) Include the guest's stated intent (work schedule, reason for stay) as a required field. A stranger who explains why they are coming is performing the civilizational ritual of declaring intentions -- it reduces the host's sense of instinctual threat. (4) Allow the host to counter-propose (adjusting duration, dates, or terms) as a controlled assertion of autonomy within the civilizational framework. The counter-proposal is the host saying 'I accept this stranger, but on my terms' -- a negotiated instinctual compromise that Freud identifies as the basis of all civilized coexistence.",

          "insight": "The cross-activation framework identifies the mechanism: a structured proposal is not just easier to read but actively reduces the host's instinctual resistance to the stranger.

      "problem": "The active lease is the phase of sustained coexistence with a stranger in the host's private domain. Freud observes that 'civilized society is perpetually menaced with disintegration through this primary hostility of men towards one another.' The equivalent in the host journey: every week the guest occupies the space, the host's instinctual anxiety about the stranger must be re-managed. Without structured mechanisms, this anxiety accumulates and either erupts as conflict or crystallizes into a decision not to re-list at retention. The host needs predictable touchpoints that confirm the civilizational order is holding -- that the guest is following the rules, the space is being respected, and the arrangement is working. Freud identifies the solution as 'order: a kind of repetition-compulsion by which it is ordained once for all when, where and how a thing shall be done so that on every similar occasion doubt and hesitation shall be avoided.'",
      "solution": "Design the active lease phase around predictable, recurring rituals that provide the host with regular evidence of civilizational compliance. (1) Per-stay cleaning photo submissions: the guest uploads photos of the space at departure, visible to the host. This is not a chore but a ritual of respect -- it demonstrates that the guest treats the host's space as the host would. (2) Per-stay micro-reviews: after each stay cycle, both host and guest submit a brief assessment. This creates a cadence of mutual accountability that Freud would recognize as civilization's monitoring mechanism. (3) Arrival and departure notifications: the guest confirms arrival and departure within the Stays Manager, creating a predictable rhythm the host can rely on. (4) Weekly or per-stay dashboard summary: the host sees a snapshot of the most recent stay -- dates confirmed, cleaning photos submitted, any issues flagged. The pattern is: predictability reduces instinctual anxiety, and every confirmed ritual is evidence that the civilizational contract is holding.",

      "problem": "Retention is the weakest phase in the host journey (the existing library has 44 mentions vs. 152 for active lease). The fundamental problem is psychological, not functional: at lease end, the host stands at Freud's fork between 're-entering civilization' (re-listing, accepting another stranger) and 'returning to primitive conditions' (reclaiming full autonomy, no guests, no platform). The user stories document does not address retention directly, which itself signals how little the current system invests in this phase. Freud's Ch V identifies 'the narcissism of minor differences' as the mechanism by which accumulated small grievances crystallize into a narrative of civilizational dissatisfaction. A host who had 12 good weeks and 1 bad week will, in retrospect, anchor on the bad week. Without a counter-mechanism, the subjective retrospective assessment defaults to the negative, and the host does not re-list.",

Freud identifies that 'it is always possible to unite considerable numbers of men in love towards one another, so long as there are still some remaining as objects for aggressive manifestations.' The platform equivalent: (1) Build a host identity layer: hosting milestones (first guest, 10th stay, 1-year anniversary), visible hosting track record, and a host-facing narrative of their hosting history. This transforms the abstract transactional relationship into a personal identity investment. (2) Surface the cumulative economic value: total earnings, successful stays completed, positive reviews received. The host should see not just 'lease ended' but 'you have earned $12,000 across 3 guests over 18 months.' (3) Allow hosts to channel their civilizational frustrations outward rather than inward: provide forums, feedback channels, or structured complaint mechanisms that let the host express grievances without having to exit the platform. Freud's 'smaller communities' principle -- redirect aggressive energy toward external targets (competitors, bad actors) rather than the platform itself.

The platform's confirmation dialogs, approval flows, and rule enforcement mechanisms are this civilizational justice. But the host does not experience them as justice -- they experience them as bureaucracy. Every 'Are you sure?' dialog, every waiting period for guest approval, every required step in the date change flow is felt as the platform imposing its authority over the host's autonomy. The civilizational mediation that should feel protective instead feels restrictive. This is because the platform does not communicate WHY the mediation exists. The host sees the constraint but not the protection it provides. Freud warns that when civilizational rules feel arbitrary rather than just, they produce the antagonism that drives people to abandon civilization entirely.",
      "solution": "Redesign every platform mediation mechanism to make the justice visible and the bureaucracy invisible. (1) For confirmation flows: instead of 'Are you sure you want to accept this proposal?', show 'This proposal includes a verified guest with 3 completed leases. Accepting will lock in your rate of $X/week for Y weeks.' The confirmation becomes a summary of the protection the host is receiving, not a question about their intent. (2) For waiting periods: instead of 'Waiting for guest response,' show what is happening during the wait -- 'The guest is reviewing your counter-proposal. Their history shows they typically respond within 24 hours.' Transparency converts bureaucratic delay into civilizational process. (3) For rule enforcement: when the platform prevents an action (e.g., cannot modify dates without guest approval), explain the reciprocal protection: 'Date changes require both parties to agree, which means the guest also cannot change dates without your approval.' Every constraint the host experiences should be framed as a constraint that also protects them. The pattern: make the justice bidirectional and visible at every enforcement point.",

Every platform enforcement mechanism must make visible the justice it embodies -- that the rule applies equally to both parties and protects the host as much as it constrains them."

          "insight": "The messaging step is a civilizational mediation mechanism: it allows both parties to assess each other before the formal proposal. When the platform provides this intermediate step, it makes the civilizational process feel natural rather than bureaucratic. The same principle applies to every rule: provide the 'park bench' (the informal, low-stakes intermediate step) before the 'commitment' (the formal, binding action)."

Structured rituals (arrival notifications, cleaning photos, reviews) are the platform's version of addressing subtle aggressions that formal rules cannot reach."
