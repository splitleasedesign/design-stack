      "problem": "The host journey demands escalating surrenders of private information -- identity at onboarding, property details at listing creation, financial expectations at pricing. But the platform currently presents these demands without regard for the cumulative psychological cost. Freud identifies that 'civilization is built up on renunciation of instinctual gratifications' and that this 'cultural privation dominates the whole field of social relations.' The information architecture problem is: what information to request at each phase, and what to withhold requesting until later, so that each disclosure feels proportional to the value already received. When the platform asks for too much too early (photos before the host has seen demand signals, financial details before the host understands the guarantee), it triggers what Freud calls the 'antagonism against which all civilization has to fight' -- the host's instinctual revolt against an information extraction that feels unjustified.",
      "solution": "Structure the information request sequence so that every disclosure demanded is preceded by a value disclosure from the platform. Discovery reveals market demand data (no host information requested). Evaluation reveals the agent and payment guarantee (only basic contact requested). Onboarding reveals the agent relationship and matched guest demand (identity verification requested). Listing creation reveals comparable earnings and guest interest signals (property details and photos requested). Each tier of the information hierarchy follows the same pattern: the platform discloses civilizational value first, then the host discloses instinctual territory. The ratio should be approximately 2:1 -- two pieces of platform value for every one piece of host disclosure. This mirrors Freud's graduated renunciation: the host surrenders incrementally, and each surrender is 'made good economically' by prior evidence that the civilizational contract pays.",

The host experiences these as bureaucratic constraints on their autonomy -- Freud's 'cultural privation' applied to action rather than information. But the host does not see the bidirectional nature of these constraints. When the platform says 'Date changes require both parties to agree,' the host hears 'I cannot change dates without permission.' They do not automatically hear 'The guest also cannot change dates without my permission.' Freud identifies that 'the first requisite of culture is justice -- the assurance that a law once made will not be broken in favour of any individual.' But justice is only perceived as justice when both sides of the constraint are visible. One-sided constraint information produces the experience of oppression, not protection.",
      "solution": "Every rule, restriction, or confirmation in the information architecture must surface both sides of the constraint simultaneously. The information template for any platform-enforced rule is: [What you cannot do unilaterally] + [What the other party also cannot do unilaterally] + [What this protects for you]. For example: 'Date changes require mutual agreement. This means the guest cannot change your scheduled stays without your approval, and you cannot change theirs without their agreement. Both of you are protected from unexpected disruptions.' The bidirectional frame transforms the information from a restriction notice into a protection notice. The scan order places the protection first and the restriction second, so the host's initial impression (Freud's automatic assessment, analogous to L1's System 1 gate) is safety rather than constraint.",

The information architecture challenge is: what information about the guest must be surfaced, in what order, and at what granularity, to reduce the host's instinctual threat response before it crystallizes into rejection or inaction. Currently, guest information is distributed across multiple surfaces -- profile page, proposal body, reviews section, verification badges.

The host who pauses should see their full hosting history upon return, reinforcing the investment they have already made in the civilizational contract."

      "solution": "Create a Hosting Summary surface that is always accessible from the dashboard and is prominently surfaced at two critical moments: (1) when a lease ends, and (2) when a paused host returns. The summary presents the host's cumulative civilizational investment in scannable form: total earnings since joining, total successful stays, average review rating received, number of guests hosted, hosting tenure (months/years). Below the summary, a timeline shows the hosting trajectory -- each lease as a segment, with earnings and review scores plotted over time. The trajectory makes the cumulative trend visible and counteracts the narcissism of minor differences by embedding any single negative experience within a larger positive pattern. At lease end, the re-listing prompt appears directly below the summary, framed as continuation ('Continue hosting') rather than a new decision ('Create new listing'). The information architecture ensures the host evaluates re-listing in the context of their full history, not in the context of the most recent experience alone.",

Tertiary: hosting identity signals (tenure, milestones, community membership). Financial return is primary because Freud's framework identifies the economic exchange as the foundation of civilizational participation -- the host traded autonomy for income, and the income must be visible.",
      "disclosure_pattern": "Persistent and contextual. The Hosting Summary is always accessible (one click from dashboard) but is most prominently surfaced at lease-end and return-from-pause moments. At lease-end, it appears before the re-listing prompt, ensuring the host's retrospective assessment includes the full cumulative picture. At return-from-pause, it appears as the first screen, reinforcing the preserved investment. Between these moments, cumulative metrics appear as a compact widget on the dashboard's tertiary tier.",
