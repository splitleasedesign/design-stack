The Freud lens adds a critical dimension that the existing library's Kahneman-based emotional design did not cover: the host's journey is not just a cognitive processing challenge but a psychological negotiation between instinctual freedom and civilizational participation. The arc correctly identifies that the emotional peak (listing_creation) coincides with the renunciation peak, and that the emotional trough (retention) coincides with the civilizational re-evaluation moment. The key insight is that the emotional arc is not linear (building from low to high) but U-shaped: high engagement at discovery (curiosity), dipping through the renunciation gradient (listing creation), stabilizing at active lease (calm), and requiring active intervention at retention (accomplishment) to prevent the natural decay toward exit. No fundamental arc conflicts exist; the two minor conflicts identified above are resolvable through complementary design strategies."
