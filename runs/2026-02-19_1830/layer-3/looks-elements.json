      "problem": "The host journey demands escalating surrenders of private space into public marketplace artifacts. Freud identifies that civilization requires 'beauty, cleanliness and order' -- but when the visual language feels cold, clinical, or institutional, the host experiences the platform's demands as extraction rather than protection. Flat, sharp-cornered containers with thin gray borders read as bureaucratic forms. The host's instinctual resistance to 'cultural privation' intensifies when the visual environment signals authority rather than safety. The user stories confirm this: 'Value before the ask -- always.' If the visual surface itself feels like a demand (sterile, impersonal, corporate), the host's System 1 rejects the environment before any content is evaluated. The challenge is to make structured layouts feel protective rather than restrictive -- to visually embody Freud's insight that civilization should offer security in exchange for the instinctual sacrifices it demands.",
      "solution": "Use rounded containers (--rounded-xl: 12px or --rounded-2xl: 16px) with warm-tinted backgrounds (--bg-off-white: rgb(252, 250, 255) or --protocol-surface: #F7F2FA) and subtle purple-tinted shadows (--shadow-purple-sm) as the primary containment pattern across all journey phases. These containers represent the boundary between private and shared space -- they hold the host's information within a visually warm enclosure that signals 'your data is safe here.' The rounded corners soften the civilizational demand; the warm tint distinguishes the platform from cold transactional surfaces (banking, government, legal). Every card, wizard step, proposal view, and dashboard section should use this containment pattern consistently. The border should use --border-color (#e5e7eb) at 1px, never heavy or dark borders that feel like constraint. The interior should always have slightly more generous padding (--spacing-2xl: 24px minimum) to create breathing room -- Freud's 'order' requires that the host never feels visually crowded by the platform's demands.",

Freud's Ch V identifies that 'civilized man has exchanged some part of his chances of happiness for a measure of security.' The visual language must make this security tangible. If the primary brand color reads as playful, cheap, or inconsistent, the host's System 1 assessment fails: this platform does not look serious enough to trust with my property. The production style guide uses a deep purple palette (#31135D primary) that inherently signals premium stability -- but the visual system must deploy this purple with discipline. Purple used everywhere becomes wallpaper; purple used at key authority moments becomes a trust signal. The challenge is to reserve the deepest brand purple for moments where the platform asserts its civilizational authority (guarantees, protections, confirmations) so the host learns to associate the brand color with security.",

It says: 'this action is endorsed by the platform.' (3) Accent purple (--accent-purple, rgb(140, 104, 238)) appears on hover states and subtle highlights. It says: 'this element is responsive to you.' (4) Purple-tinted backgrounds (--bg-off-white, --protocol-surface) provide ambient brand presence without competing for attention. The gradient (--gradient-purple-primary: linear-gradient(135deg, #31135D 0%, #5a2d8f 100%)) should be reserved for the header and hero-level trust assertions -- never for decorative cards or non-authoritative content.

      "problem": "Freud identifies three demands civilization places on its members: beauty, cleanliness, and order. Typography is the primary vehicle for all three in a digital interface -- it conveys aesthetic quality (beauty), information clarity (cleanliness), and structural hierarchy (order). The production style guide uses Inter and DM Sans as its primary typefaces, while the taste model prescribes Instrument Serif for personality, Outfit for clarity, and IBM Plex Mono for data trust. There is a tension between what is in production and what the taste model envisions. The visual pattern must resolve this: regardless of which specific typefaces ship, the principle is that different typographic registers serve different civilizational functions. Body text that reassures ('Your payment is guaranteed') needs a different visual register than body text that instructs ('Upload 4 photos of your space') or body text that proves ('$4,200 earned across 12 stays'). Without typographic differentiation, all information carries equal visual weight, and the host cannot distinguish reassurance from instruction from evidence -- which means the platform's civilizational signals (protection, order, proof) blur together.",
      "solution": "Apply three typographic registers mapped to civilizational function: (1) Reassurance register: used for headlines, brand statements, value propositions, and emotional anchors ('Your space is in good hands,' 'Payment guaranteed'). In production, use --font-heading (Inter) at --font-weight-bold (700) with --text-2xl (28px) or larger. If the taste model's Instrument Serif is adopted, this register benefits most from serif warmth. The reassurance register should feel human, warm, and authoritative. (2) Action register: used for body text, instructions, labels, form fields, button text, and navigation. Use --font-inter at --font-weight-medium (500) for labels and --font-weight-normal (400) for body. Sizes from --text-base (14px) to --text-md (16px). This register should feel clear, efficient, and neutral -- Freud's 'order' made typographic. (3) Evidence register: used for financial figures, dates, statistics, verification badges, review scores, and completion percentages. Use --font-inter at --font-weight-semibold (600) with tabular figures enabled where possible. If IBM Plex Mono or a monospace alternative is adopted, financial and statistical data should use it. The evidence register signals precision and reliability -- it converts the platform's abstract promises into concrete, verifiable numbers.

For a host who is already managing the instinctual anxiety of sharing their space with a stranger, red notification badges transform routine platform actions into perceived crises.

If the visual layout changes between visits -- if cards move, if sections reorder, if the information hierarchy shifts -- the host must relearn the interface each time. This violates Freud's repetition-compulsion principle and produces the doubt and hesitation that order is meant to eliminate. The visual system must create a ritual cadence: a layout that is identical every time the host visits, so the eye knows exactly where to find each piece of information without searching.

The card dimensions, padding, and internal layout are identical for every stay. The host's eye finds the cleaning photos in the same position on every card. (3) Visual rhythm through consistent spacing: --spacing-2xl (24px) between cards, --spacing-lg (16px) between zones, --spacing-md (12px) between elements within a card. This rhythm is never broken by promotional content, announcements, or variable-height elements. (4) Progress visualization: the cumulative lease timeline (how many stays completed out of total) uses a horizontal progress bar in --secondary-purple against --bg-light-gray, positioned consistently at the top of the Stays Manager view. The host sees lease progress at a glance, every visit, in the same place.",

      "problem": "At retention, the host performs a retrospective cost-benefit analysis. Freud's 'narcissism of minor differences' predicts that the host's memory will anchor on small grievances rather than the cumulative positive record. The L2 communicates layer prescribes a Hosting Summary surface showing total earnings, successful stays, average reviews, and hosting tenure. The visual challenge is: how to display cumulative evidence so that the net-positive trajectory is immediately obvious, counteracting the negativity bias Freud describes. A plain text list ('$12,400 total earnings | 28 stays | 4.8 rating') is factually accurate but visually flat -- it does not create the emotional impact needed to overcome the host's instinctual desire to 'go back to primitive conditions' (stop hosting). The cumulative evidence must be visually arresting: large, confident, and warm -- making the host feel that their civilizational participation was an achievement, not just a transaction.",
      "solution": "Design the Hosting Summary as a visually prominent data display using the evidence typographic register at hero scale. (1) Headline metric: total earnings displayed at --text-4xl (36px) in --primary-purple (#31135D) with --font-weight-bold (700). This is the largest number on the screen -- the host's eye finds it immediately. The dollar sign uses the action register (--font-weight-medium) to let the number itself dominate. (2) Supporting metrics: total stays, average rating, and hosting tenure displayed at --text-xl (20px) in --text-dark (#1a1a1a), arranged in a horizontal row below the headline. Each metric uses a Feather icon (--icon-md: 24px) in --secondary-purple to the left, creating visual anchors. (3) Hosting trajectory: a minimal timeline visualization below the metrics, using a horizontal bar segmented by lease periods. Each segment is filled with --secondary-purple at opacity proportional to the earnings of that lease. Positive review periods are marked with small purple dots along the top edge. This creates a visual narrative of 'your hosting record over time' that embeds any single negative experience within a larger positive pattern. (4) Re-listing CTA positioned directly below the trajectory, using --gradient-purple-button for the 'Continue Hosting' button. The visual flow is: see your achievement > see your trajectory > continue. (5) The entire summary sits inside a warm container (looks-001) with generous internal padding (--spacing-4xl: 32px) to create a sense of visual importance.

Freud warns that 'the first requisite of culture is justice -- the assurance that a law once made will not be broken in favour of any individual.' But visually, confirmation dialogs, rule notices, and constraint explanations across most platforms use a cold, modal-overlay pattern: white box, gray text, two buttons. This visual pattern signals bureaucracy -- it feels like a legal notice, not a protective mechanism. The host's System 1 reads the visual pattern before the text content, and if the pattern says 'bureaucracy,' the bidirectional framing cannot overcome the initial impression. The visual challenge is to make constraint surfaces feel like protection surfaces -- to make the Freudian 'law' feel like the Freudian 'security' it provides.",
      "solution": "Design constraint and confirmation surfaces with a distinctive visual pattern that signals protection rather than bureaucracy. (1) Background: use --protocol-surface (#F7F2FA) -- the warm purple-tinted surface -- instead of plain white. This immediately distinguishes the protection surface from generic modals and gives it a warm, brand-connected quality. (2) Icon: lead with a Feather shield icon (or similar protective symbol) in --secondary-purple at --icon-lg (28px), positioned to the left of the headline text. The shield signals 'this is protection' before any text is read. (3) Headline: use the reassurance typographic register (--font-weight-bold, --text-lg) in --primary-purple for the protection statement. Example: 'Both parties are protected.' The headline is always the protection assertion, never the constraint description. (4) Body: two short statements in the action register (--text-base, --font-weight-normal, --text-description color). First: 'The guest cannot change dates without your approval.' Second: 'You also cannot change dates without the guest's agreement.' The bidirectional framing is visually parallel: same type size, same line spacing, same indentation. Visual parallelism makes the bidirectionality self-evident. (5) Border: 1px --border-color with --rounded-xl (12px), consistent with warm containment (looks-001).
