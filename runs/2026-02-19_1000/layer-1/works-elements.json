      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "When hosts evaluate a potential match, they ask predictable questions rooted in their landlord experience: combined tenant income, employment details, credit standing, and lease term flexibility. In Jason's call, Bryant could not answer the combined income question in real time (06:21: 'I'd have to look that up. I don't have it handy with me right now'). This forces the host to make an evaluation decision with incomplete data, or to wait for a follow-up that introduces delay and decay. Cagan's root causes of failed product initiatives (Ch. 6) identify this as a discovery preparation failure: the team should know what data the host needs before the interaction occurs, not discover it during the interaction. Every unanswered question during evaluation becomes a reason to defer commitment, and deferral in a competitive market (where Jason has 6 showings and guests are considering other places) equals lost conversion.",
      "solution": "Ensure that every host-facing interaction -- whether human-mediated or platform-mediated -- has instant access to the complete data set a landlord predictably needs. This means: (1) Before any agent call, pre-assemble a host evaluation packet containing: combined and individual tenant income, employment verification status, credit check results, previous landlord references, and proposed term flexibility. The agent should have this on-screen during the call. (2) On the platform, surface this data proactively on the proposal or match screen before the host asks for it. If the host can see combined income, employment status, and credit rating at a glance, they do not need to ask. (3) Identify the 5-7 questions that hosts predictably ask (income, credit, showings, term, move-in date, pets, furnishing preference) and ensure every one has an answer pre-populated in the system before the host encounters the match. (4) If any data point is genuinely unavailable, acknowledge it explicitly with an expected resolution date, rather than letting it become an ambiguous gap.",

      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "onboarding", "proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "Hosts sourced from competing channels (Craigslist, traditional listings) are simultaneously running parallel evaluation processes. Jason has done 6 showings and has active traditional leads. The guests are also considering other places (13:26: 'They're taking a look at a couple other places'). This creates a dual-sided ticking clock: the host may fill the vacancy through conventional means, and the guests may choose another property. The current process -- phone call, then email follow-up 'shortly after,' then await response -- does not compress this timeline. Cagan's startup framework (Ch. 3) states 'you are in a race to achieve product/market fit before you run out of money.' For each host interaction, Split Lease is in an analogous race: convert before the host's alternative channels close the deal. Every hour of delay burns conversion runway.",
      "solution": "Compress the time between first contact and actionable commitment by eliminating dead time in the process. This means: (1) During the phone call itself, create a micro-commitment that locks the host's attention for the next step. 'I am sending you a link right now -- can you confirm you received it?' is better than 'I will follow up with an email shortly.' The link should arrive while the host is still on the phone. (2) On the platform, show the host where they stand relative to the guest's timeline. If guests are deciding by Friday, the host should see 'Ariel and Amber are reviewing 3 spaces and will decide by March 1.' Transparent urgency is more compelling than vague follow-ups. (3) Reduce the number of handoffs between human and digital. Each handoff introduces a gap. If the call can transition directly to a platform action (host opens the link, sees the proposal, confirms interest with one click), the gap disappears. (4) Track and optimize the 'first-contact-to-first-commitment' metric as the primary conversion indicator, not just 'listing created' or 'lease signed.'",

      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "proposal_mgmt", "retention"],
      "problem": "Hosts who come from traditional rental channels (Craigslist, word-of-mouth, broker networks) carry deeply ingrained expectations about how renting works: in-person showings before lease signing, direct income verification, physical property tours, and personal relationship with the tenant. Jason's call reveals this mental model clash in sharp detail. He has done 6 showings and finds it 'a bit odd that they don't want to see the place before they move in' (10:50). He repeats this concern twice (10:50 and 12:35), calling it 'weird.' Cagan's Ch. 6 critique of stakeholder-driven products applies: the no-showing policy was likely designed for operational efficiency (platform's perspective), not for host comfort (user's perspective). When the platform's model contradicts the host's entrenched expectations without explanation or accommodation, the host perceives the platform as deficient, not innovative.",
      "solution": "Before introducing platform-specific processes that diverge from traditional landlord expectations, explicitly acknowledge the host's existing model and bridge to the new one. This means: (1) Identify the top 5 traditional landlord expectations that the platform model changes (showings, direct income verification, face-to-face meetings, physical lease signing, personal tenant relationship). For each, prepare a clear explanation of why the platform model works differently AND what equivalent protection or benefit it provides. (2) In the agent call script, when a host raises a traditional expectation, validate it first ('That makes total sense -- most landlords want in-person showings') before explaining the platform's approach ('What we offer instead is...'). Bryant's response at 10:22 ('typically actually we don't show the place beforehand... for privacy reasons') skips validation and jumps to explanation, which Jason interprets as dismissal. (3) On the platform, present traditional landlord concepts alongside platform equivalents. Show 'Income Verification' (not 'Guest Vetting Score'), 'Security Deposit' (not 'Damage Protection Fund'), 'Lease Agreement' (not 'Stay Agreement'). Map new concepts to familiar ones. (4) Where possible, accommodate the traditional expectation rather than replacing it. If Jason wants a showing, facilitate it.

He knows furniture conditions (08:19: futon 'not the highest quality'), building security constraints on furniture movement (08:55-09:27), and plans for deep cleaning contingent on tenant needs (11:17). None of this information has a place in a standard listing form. Cagan's principle (Ch. 2) that the best technology products are 'blends of online and offline experiences' directly applies: the offline experience at Jason's property is rich and complex, but the online platform has no mechanism to capture, organize, or transmit it to guests. This knowledge gap creates a predictable failure: guests arrive without critical operational information, leading to complaints, friction, and host dissatisfaction.",

This means: (1) During the agent call or onboarding, systematically capture operational knowledge in predefined categories: parking and transportation, building rules and access, furniture and amenity conditions, cleaning and maintenance status, neighborhood tips. Use the call itself as the capture mechanism -- the agent should be entering this data into the system while the host talks. (2) On the listing creation form, include a 'Property Operations' section with guided prompts: 'What should guests know about parking?', 'Are there building rules guests should follow?', 'Any tips about the neighborhood?' These prompts should feel like natural questions, not bureaucratic fields. (3) During the active lease, surface this operational knowledge to guests as a dynamic house manual that the host can update at any time. If street cleaning schedules change, the host updates one field and all current guests see the change.

The futon is available but low-quality (08:19: 'it's not the highest quality'). Deep cleaning scope depends on whether the tenant wants furnished or unfurnished (11:17-11:38). He has 4 tables and desks but acknowledges 'really need all of that' is questionable. The current listing model forces a binary choice that does not reflect reality. When a listing says 'furnished,' the host means 'I can leave some furniture, the bed is good but the futon is mediocre, and I am willing to adjust based on what the tenant needs.' This nuance is lost in a checkbox, leading to mismatched expectations and post-match renegotiation that delays conversion.",

(2) During proposal management, present the configurable attributes as negotiation points. The guest sees 'Bed: Included. Futon: Available (host notes: functional but not premium quality). 4 desks/tables: host willing to remove some.' The guest can indicate preferences, and the host can confirm. (3) Allow the listing state to evolve: before match, during proposal negotiation, and after lease signing, the furniture and condition details can be updated. The listing is not a snapshot; it is a living document. (4) Capture condition notes honestly. Jason's willingness to flag the futon's quality (08:19) is a trust signal.

      "problem": "The phone call builds momentum -- Jason engaged for 14 minutes, asked detailed questions, volunteered information about his property, and ended on a cooperative note. But this momentum dies the moment the call ends. The next touchpoint is an email that arrives 'shortly' (13:59) with no specific timeline. Between the call and the email, Jason returns to his competing priorities: his 6 showings, his kitchen repairs, his deep cleaning plans. Cagan's framework (Ch. 3) establishes that startups must race to product/market fit, and Split Lease's conversion analog is racing each host's engagement to a commitment before it decays. The post-call gap is the single largest source of engagement decay in the current process. The host's attention is highest during the call and immediately after; every minute of delay erodes it. The current process treats the call ending as a pause. It is actually the start of a countdown.",
      "solution": "Transform the call ending from a pause into an activation event by creating an immediate, synchronous bridge to the platform. This means: (1) During the last 2 minutes of the call, the agent sends a link to the host's phone via text message. 'I just texted you a link -- when you open it, you will see the proposal for your apartment at [address] with Ariel and Amber's details.' The host can open it while still on the phone. (2) The link should open a pre-populated proposal view -- not a registration page, not a generic homepage. The host sees: property address, guest names, proposed rent, proposed term, deposit details, and a single action button: 'Interested -- Tell Me More' or 'Schedule a Viewing.' (3) The agent stays on the line for 30 seconds after sending the link: 'Did you get it? Take a look -- you will see everything we just discussed.' This transforms the digital touchpoint from an asynchronous follow-up into a synchronous continuation. (4) If the host does not open the link during the call, the follow-up email arrives within 15 minutes, not 'shortly.' The email subject line references the call: 'Jason -- Ariel and Amber's proposal for [address].'",

          "insight": "The entire onboarding hinges on a future email. There is no instant activation, no link shared during the call, no immediate next step that keeps Jason engaged. The transition from human interaction to digital interaction is fully asynchronous, creating a gap where competing alternatives can capture Jason's attention."

          "insight": "Cagan identifies speed as a core startup advantage. The post-call engagement gap is a speed failure: the platform is slow where it should be instantaneous. Moving the first digital touchpoint into the call itself is the kind of speed optimization that separates converting processes from losing ones."
