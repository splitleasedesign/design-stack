The arc follows a coherent progression: curiosity (discovery) to confidence and calm (evaluation) to momentum (onboarding) to pride and ownership (listing/proposal) to clarity (decision). The most critical emotional transition is evaluation-to-onboarding, where momentum must be preserved through synchronous activation -- this is the emotional equivalent of the library's System 1 trust gate. The arc has one notable gap: no feels elements specifically target the active_lease or retention phases, leaving those phases emotionally unspecified. Future lenses should address the emotional experience of hosts during an active lease (likely: security, peace of mind) and at retention decision points (likely: recognition, loyalty)."
