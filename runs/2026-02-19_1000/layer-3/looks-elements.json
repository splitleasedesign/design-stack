      "problem": "When hosts evaluate a guest proposal, the most critical data -- combined income, individual income, employment and credit verification -- must register instantly as authoritative and verifiable. Jason's first evaluation question was about income (06:14), and the answer was imprecise ('over 80,000'). On-screen, financial trust signals risk blending into the general visual field if they use the same typographic treatment as secondary information. The host's eye needs to separate 'hard financial data I can evaluate' from 'soft descriptive information I can read later.' Without a distinct typographic register for financial data, the host must cognitively sort information that should be visually pre-sorted.",
      "solution": "Use IBM Plex Mono at a prominent weight and size for all hard financial data on evaluation and proposal screens -- combined income, individual income, rent amount, deposit figures, and guarantee amounts. Mono typography signals precision, verifiability, and data-backed claims. Surround financial figures with generous spacing to isolate them from adjacent content. Use Outfit (sans) at medium weight for verification status labels ('Employment Verified', 'Credit Checked') positioned directly adjacent to the mono figures. Reserve Instrument Serif for the section heading ('Financial Summary') to provide warmth and brand continuity. This three-register typographic system (mono for numbers, sans for labels, serif for headings) creates an instant visual grammar: mono means 'this is a fact you can evaluate,' sans means 'this is a status you can trust,' serif means 'this is a section you are entering.'",

On-screen, if the platform simply omits a 'Schedule Showing' button without explanation, the absence creates a trust gap.

Use a single line of text in Outfit at regular weight, 13-14px, in ink-muted (#8a857e) color: 'Ariel and Amber plan to decide by [date]' or 'Proposal sent [X] days ago.' No icons, no colored backgrounds, no progress bars. The badge sits on the page background (bg #f6f4f0), not on a card surface, so it reads as ambient context rather than highlighted content. If the proposal has been open for more than 48 hours without action, the text color shifts from ink-muted to ink-soft (#4a4640) -- a subtle darkening that increases visibility without introducing urgency colors. Never use signal-warn or signal-danger colors for competitive context. The timeline date uses mono type (IBM Plex Mono, 13px) to signal factual precision.",
