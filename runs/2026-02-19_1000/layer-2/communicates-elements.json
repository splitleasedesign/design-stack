      "problem": "When hosts evaluate a potential guest match, the platform must answer the same predictable questions every traditional landlord asks: income, employment, credit, references. Jason's call reveals that income verification is the very first question he asks (06:14) -- before term, move-in date, or furnishing preferences. Bryant could not answer it precisely (06:21: 'I'd have to look that up'), forcing a deferral. The platform's information hierarchy must lead with the data landlords instinctively seek, not with platform-centric concepts like 'vetting scores' or 'guest profiles.' Jason never asks about a vetting score; he asks 'What's a total income between both of them?' The information architecture must mirror the landlord's mental evaluation tree, where income and employment are the root nodes, not decorative leaves.",
      "solution": "Structure every host-facing evaluation screen so that traditional landlord trust signals occupy the primary visual hierarchy position. Income (individual and combined), employment verification status, credit standing, and previous landlord references should be the first data the host's eye encounters. Platform-specific trust signals (deposit matching, rent guarantee) should follow as reinforcing secondary information. Guest personal details (name, preferences, move-in date) occupy the tertiary position. This mirrors how a landlord evaluates an application on paper: financials first, then credentials, then logistics.",

(3) Protect -- show what equivalent protection the host gets ('If guests are unsatisfied within 48 hours, our guarantee covers any vacancy gap'). This bridge must appear proactively at the point of divergence, not in response to a complaint.

But the current process dumps all information in a single phone call with no structure, forcing the host to mentally sort and sequence.

      "problem": "The phone call builds engagement momentum -- Jason engaged for 14 minutes, asked detailed questions, and ended cooperatively. But the next touchpoint is an email arriving 'shortly' (13:59) with no specific timeline. Between the call and the email, the host's attention returns to competing priorities: 6 showings, kitchen repairs, deep cleaning. The information architecture currently treats the call and the platform as separate, sequential channels. The host builds a mental model during the call (verbal information about guests, terms, deposit) and then must reconstruct it later from an email or platform screen. This reconstruction is lossy -- details are forgotten, enthusiasm fades, competing alternatives progress. The information architecture must bridge the call and the platform into a single continuous information flow.",
      "solution": "During the final 2 minutes of the call, send the host a text message with a direct link to a pre-populated proposal view. The link opens a screen that presents everything discussed in the call, structured according to the host's decision sequence (communicates-003): financial trust signals first, term details second, operational details third. The host can scan this screen while still on the phone with the agent, who confirms: 'Did you get it? You should see Ariel and Amber's proposal for your place.' The screen requires no account creation, no login, no registration -- just the proposal data and a single action button ('Interested -- Tell Me More' or 'Request a Showing'). The information architecture of this first-touch screen must be maximally scannable because the host is dividing attention between the screen and the phone call.",

The guests do not know that Jason has active traditional leads. The platform possesses this competitive context but does not surface it, leaving both parties in an information vacuum that encourages procrastination.
