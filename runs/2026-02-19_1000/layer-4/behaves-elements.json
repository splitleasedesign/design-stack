Between the call ending and the email arriving, the host's engagement decays and competitive alternatives progress. There is no interactive response to the host's peak engagement moment. The system treats the call ending as a pause when it should treat it as a trigger for immediate digital activation. Cagan's principle that good startups are 'optimized for learning and moving quickly' (Ch. 3) means the platform must respond to the host's expressed interest with the same speed the host experienced during the conversation.",
      "solution": "When the agent determines the host is engaged (typically at the email-collection moment around 09:27), the system should optimistically generate and send a proposal link via SMS before the call ends. The link opens a pre-populated, zero-login proposal view. The interaction principle is: treat the host's willingness to share their email as a commitment signal and respond instantly with value, not with a promise of future value. The SMS arrives while the host is still on the phone, and the agent confirms receipt in real-time. If the link generation fails or the proposal data is incomplete, the system falls back gracefully to the email follow-up without the host perceiving a failure.",

The platform must handle the reality that tenant data arrives incrementally: some fields are populated at guest signup, others after vetting, others after manual verification. The current system treats incomplete data as a reason to defer ('I will send that later'), but the host's decision process cannot wait.

The current interaction has no mechanism to detect when a host encounters a divergence point and proactively deploy an explanation.

The interaction must detect the divergence encounter and respond with a structured bridge before the concern compounds.",

Each prompt is a question in the host's vocabulary: 'What should guests know about parking near your place?'
