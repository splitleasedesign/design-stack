Cagan's framework (Ch. 3) emphasizes that startups must race to product/market fit, and the discovery phase reveals that Split Lease is currently in a 'concierge discovery' mode -- manually sourcing hosts from competitor platforms rather than attracting them through product-led discovery.

Jason mentions he has done 6 showings and recently resolved kitchen issues (13:31), indicating he invests effort in maintaining and improving his property -- a positive retention signal if the platform rewards this behavior. However, Jason's resistance to the no-showing norm (10:50, 12:35) suggests that if this first experience does not align with his landlord expectations, he will not return. Cagan's Ch. 5 on enterprise companies warns about the 'slow death spiral' where companies fail to consistently innovate for existing users. For Split Lease, the retention equivalent is: if Jason's first guest experience is mediocre (due to unresolved issues flagged in the call), he will revert to Craigslist rather than give the platform a second chance. The platform must also solve a Cagan-identified scaling challenge: Jason is a single-property host, so retention economics differ from multi-property hosts.",
