  "crossref_summary": "The transcript evidence overwhelmingly validates that Craigslist is not a theoretical competitor but the actual discovery channel for Split Lease itself. At least 18 of the 68 transcripts contain direct Craigslist references — Split Lease agents literally introduce themselves as 'from Craigslist' when calling hosts and guests, and hosts found Split Lease's postings on Craigslist. The most striking finding: Tag (host) opens his call with 'I don't know if this guy is legit or what it is' after seeing repeated Craigslist postings, perfectly validating the trust vacuum disappointment. Robbie (host) discovers his Craigslist listing was removed mid-conversation, exposing the platform's unreliability. Steve Zhang's origin story reveals that Split Lease itself was born from a Craigslist experiment — 1,200 scraped Airbnb listings posted across 60 cities, with responses like 'my commute is f*****g terrible and I would love to stay at your space.' The transcripts confirm that Craigslist's disappointments are not analytical observations — they are the lived reality of Split Lease's founding and its current user acquisition funnel.",
