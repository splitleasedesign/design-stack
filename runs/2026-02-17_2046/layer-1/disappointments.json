  "disappointment_summary": "Craigslist's room-sharing experience is a masterclass in accidental adequacy. It didn't set out to create a room-sharing category — it set out to digitize classifieds, and rooms happened to be one of the things people listed. The result is a platform where every phase beyond the initial listing is either mediocre or completely absent. The 'coffee' at this restaurant isn't just unremarkable — the restaurant doesn't serve coffee at all for half the meal. Discovery works through sheer inertia (everyone knows Craigslist). Search barely works. Listing evaluation demands heroic effort from the user. Booking, communication, active-stay, post-stay, and retention are entirely absent as product phases. The deepest disappointment pattern is structural: Craigslist treats room-sharing as a posting-and-forgetting transaction when it is actually a relationship that unfolds over weeks or months. Through Play Bigger's lens, this is what happens when a platform accidentally inherits a category without ever designing it — every phase beyond the core classifieds function is abandoned because the business was never built to serve this use case.",

Craigslist anchored 'room search' as 'scan a list of links.' This means users don't KNOW that room search could involve commute-time mapping, photo-rich cards, or compatibility scoring. The disappointment is invisible because the anchor is so low. But Play Bigger also shows that when a category king redefines the anchor (like Uber redefining 'get a ride'), the old way instantly feels intolerable.

      "why_its_not_a_bug": "Craigslist is a bulletin board, not a marketing platform. Hosts post for free and take what they get. The platform provides equal access — every listing gets the same treatment. No optimization tools means no gaming the system, which aligns with Craigslist's egalitarian philosophy.",
      "why_it_matters_psychologically": "Play Bigger Ch 2 on the magic triangle: 'product design is the purposeful building of a product and experience that solves the problem the market needs solved.' For hosts, the problem isn't just 'post a room' — it's 'find a good guest for my room.' Craigslist solves the posting problem but not the finding problem. The host has no feedback loop, no iteration capability, no data to improve. This is anti-flywheel: each posting teaches the host nothing about how to make the next posting better.",

This is the clearest evidence that Craigslist never designed a room-sharing category — it designed a classifieds platform and room-sharing happened to use it. The entire post-listing user journey is unowned territory.",
      "signature_potential": "Split Lease's full-lifecycle platform (proposals, negotiation, stays manager, date changes, reviews) is not a feature advantage — it's a CATEGORY advantage. It's the difference between a listing platform and a managed room-sharing platform. Through Play Bigger's lens, this cluster represents the category design opportunity: build the infrastructure Craigslist never built, and you define the category."

      "pattern": "Across listing evaluation, scam detection, and booking, users bear 100% of the trust-building burden. No profiles, no reviews, no verification, no platform protection. Every interaction requires the user to independently assess: is this real? Is this person safe? Is this worth the risk? The cognitive cost of this self-directed trust assessment is enormous and falls disproportionately on the most vulnerable users (those new to room-sharing, in a new city, or in urgent housing need).",
      "signature_potential": "A trust-first room-sharing platform (verified hosts, stay-by-stay reviews, payment protection, dispute resolution) would be the equivalent of Uber's rating system applied to informal housing. This is the Groupthink Bias opportunity from Play Bigger Ch 2: create the 'pack' that makes users feel safe. The first platform to do this becomes the trust anchor for the entire category."

The platform provides raw information (listings) but no intelligence (structured data, relevance ranking, memory, verification). Users must parse unstructured text, compare listings manually, remember their search criteria across sessions, and detect scams independently. This cognitive labor is the 'tax' of using an undesigned category — and users pay it because they don't know it could be different.",
      "signature_potential": "Structured listings, intelligent search, user memory, and trust verification would eliminate the cognitive tax. Through Play Bigger's Anchoring Effect: once users experience a category where the platform does the cognitive work, they can never go back to doing it themselves. This is how Uber made hailing cabs feel 'dumb.'"

Craigslist's taxonomy organizes by property type, not by user need. Hosts post without context about who they're posting for. The category has no point of view, no problem frame, no 'you have a commute problem and here's the solution' narrative.",
      "signature_potential": "This is the Play Bigger thesis distilled: 'winning companies today market the problem, not just the solution.' The first company to define 'the hybrid worker commute problem' as a solvable category — and position room-sharing as the solution — will own the problem frame. This is pure category design, not product improvement."
