      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "onboarding"],
      "problem": "Kent's 12 questions follow a natural escalating hierarchy -- from 'what do you do?' to 'can I see a contract?' -- and the communicates layer (communicates-008) identifies this as a sequential evidence ladder. But without a corresponding visual rhythm, the ladder collapses into a wall of text. The due-diligence host scans vertically, question by question, and needs each rung to be visually distinct yet connected to the next. If all answers look identical (same weight, same size, same spacing), the host cannot locate their current position in the sequence or feel forward momentum. Campbell describes the hero's journey as a series of distinct threshold crossings, each with its own visual character -- dark forest, great tree, babbling spring. The evaluation-phase content needs the same visual differentiation: each rung a discrete visual moment that advances the host toward the next.",
      "solution": "Establish a vertical cadence where each evidence-ladder rung occupies a visually bounded section with consistent internal structure but clear separation from adjacent rungs. Each rung follows a three-layer pattern: a serif headline (the answer in one sentence), a sans-serif body (supporting evidence in two to three lines), and a mono-set data point (the verifiable fact -- a number, a date, a link). The vertical spacing between rungs is generous (xl or xxl) to create breathing room, while internal spacing within a rung is tight (sm to md) to bind the layers together. This creates a scannable rhythm: headline-evidence-fact, gap, headline-evidence-fact, gap. The host's eye moves down the page in predictable pulses, and each pulse answers one question from their natural sequence.",

          "insight": "Each question is a discrete information need. The visual system must honor this discreteness -- blending answers into continuous prose loses the host's position in the sequence. Each answer needs its own visual container."

The communicates layer (communicates-010) prescribes placing the credibility triad (company age, founder background, track record) before the proposition in the information hierarchy. The visual challenge is that credibility markers must be compact enough to fit above the fold without displacing the proposition, yet prominent enough that due-diligence hosts register them in the first five seconds. If the markers are too large, they push the proposition below the fold and delay comprehension. If they are too small, they are overlooked.

The mono typography for the facts signals data precision and makes the numbers scannable at a glance. The markers sit on the page's base background (not in a card or container) to avoid visual weight, but a subtle bottom border or divider separates them from the proposition below.

The communicates layer (communicates-011) prescribes a sequenced review path to replace the post-call void. The visual challenge is that a sequenced multi-day email drip has no persistent visual representation -- each email arrives and disappears into the inbox, with no sense of accumulated progress or forward momentum. Campbell describes the hero's journey as forward movement through distinct stages, but the post-call review period has no visual stages at all. The host needs to see where they are in the review process and what comes next, or the sequence feels like disconnected emails rather than a guided path toward commitment.",
      "solution": "Include in each post-call email (and on the host's platform landing page if they have one) a compact visual progress element: a horizontal sequence of three to four labeled steps with the current step highlighted. The steps might be: 'Success Stories' (Day 1), 'Sample Contract' (Day 2), 'Policies' (Day 4), 'Follow-up Call' (Day 5-7). The current step uses accent background with white text; completed steps use accent-light background with accent text; future steps use bg-deep background with ink-soft text. The element is narrow -- one line of content occupying the top of the email or landing page -- but it transforms disconnected communications into a visible journey. The host can see at a glance: 'I am on step 2 of 4. I have reviewed the success stories. Now I am reading the contract. Next comes the policies.'

The communicates layer (communicates-013) prescribes surfacing non-negotiable terms as the first configuration step in listing creation. The visual challenge is that configuration controls for boundary terms (minimum stay, guest requirements, availability) are typically designed as secondary form inputs -- text fields, dropdowns, or sliders buried within a longer form. For the due-diligence host, these are not secondary inputs. They are the primary condition for participation. If the visual treatment makes boundary controls look like 'just another form field,' the host may miss them, accept poor defaults, or fail to feel that the platform takes their boundaries seriously. Campbell describes the threshold as 'a form of self-annihilation' -- the host must feel that they control the terms of their surrender.",
      "solution": "Design boundary configuration controls as visually prominent, interactive elements with immediate consequence feedback. The minimum stay control, for example, uses a large slider or segmented selector on a surface-warm card background, with the current value displayed prominently in mono typography at text-xl (20px) size. Below the selector, an immediate-feedback line in sans regular shows the consequence: 'With this setting, you will only receive proposals for stays of [value] or longer.' The consequence line updates in real time as the host adjusts the control, providing instant visual proof that the platform will enforce the boundary. The entire boundary card uses the accent-light left border (same as the artifact card pattern, looks-009) to signal 'this protects you.'
