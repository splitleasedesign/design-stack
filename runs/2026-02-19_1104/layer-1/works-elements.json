      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "proposal_mgmt", "retention"],
      "problem": "The platform and its agents currently treat host questions as objections to overcome rather than as the mechanism by which the host builds the trust necessary to proceed. Kent asks about company background (02:38), founder experience (02:50), fee structure (04:22), vetting process (04:56), references (06:16), payment timing (07:02), company age (08:11), sample contracts (09:24), and minimum stay terms (09:31). Each question is a threshold test. If the platform interprets this as resistance and tries to fast-track Kent past his questions, it will trigger exactly the permanent refusal Campbell warns about: 'Refusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative.' But Kent's refusal is not permanent -- it is preparatory. He explicitly states 'I wanna do my due diligence before I agree to anything' (09:10), framing his evaluation as a precondition for commitment, not a substitute for it. The current process has no mechanism to distinguish productive refusal (I am building trust through evidence) from permanent refusal (I am not interested), and therefore cannot serve either appropriately.",
      "solution": "Design the evaluation and onboarding phases to actively support and accelerate the due-diligence process rather than trying to bypass it. This means: (1) Anticipate the due-diligence host's question sequence and pre-answer it. Kent's questions follow a predictable pattern: who are you, what is your track record, how do you handle money, how do you vet people, can I see the contracts, what are the terms. The platform should present these answers proactively, in this natural order, before the host has to ask. (2) Provide verifiable evidence at every claim. When Kent asks 'how do I check you out?' (06:16), he is asking for third-party validation. The platform should surface testimonials, review links, and verifiable credentials without requiring the host to request them. (3) Recognize that the due-diligence pattern recurs at every phase transition. Kent will evaluate proposals with the same thoroughness he evaluated the platform itself. Each proposal view must surface the vetting evidence that due-diligence hosts need to proceed. (4) Never rush the due-diligence host. Campbell's insight is that the refusal IS the journey for this archetype -- it is how they cross the threshold. Rushing it creates permanent refusal.",

      "problem": "Kent will not cross any threshold without first possessing a concrete artifact that addresses his specific fear about what lies beyond that threshold. During the call, he requests: success stories to verify the platform's track record (06:16), sample contracts to understand what he would sign (09:24), policy documents to understand the rules (10:02), and Frederick's personal contact information as a human safety net (08:48). Campbell describes these as 'amulets against the dragon forces he is about to pass' -- protective devices provided by the supernatural aid figure. The current process delivers these artifacts only when the host asks for them, and only through a single channel (email from the agent). There is no systematic mechanism to identify which artifact each host needs at each phase boundary, or to deliver the right artifact at the right moment. The result is that hosts who do not know to ask (unlike Kent) never receive the artifact they need, and hosts who do ask must wait for a human to respond.",

Walled in boredom, hard work, or culture, the subject loses the power of significant affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved.' The post-call period is a void where the due-diligence host is alone with a stack of documents and no external structure to guide them through the review. Kent's due-diligence personality means he will review thoroughly, but his review has no deadline, no sequence, and no feedback mechanism. If any document raises a concern, there is no immediate way to resolve it. If his review goes well, there is no prompt to take the next step.

Not 'I will send you materials' but 'I will send you the success stories tonight, and I will call you Thursday at 2pm to answer any questions after you have reviewed them.' The follow-up call creates temporal structure and eliminates the infinite-deferral risk. (2) Sequence the document review. Do not send all materials at once. Send the success stories first (the easiest to consume and most emotionally compelling). Follow up 24 hours later with the contract samples. Follow up 24 hours after that with the policy documents. Each delivery is a touchpoint that re-engages the host and advances them through the evaluation. (3) Build a digital equivalent: an onboarding checklist that shows the host what to review and in what order, with a progress indicator. The checklist creates structure where the void had none. (4) Set an automated re-engagement trigger. If the host has not opened the materials within 48 hours, send a brief check-in.

Frederick answers with a process description: rental application, information collection, document checks, lease signing (05:05). But process descriptions are claims, not evidence. When Kent eventually receives his first guest proposal, he will need to see the OUTPUT of the vetting process, not just be told that the process exists. Campbell's framework illuminates why: the proposal is Kent's encounter with the 'polymorphous beings' of the unknown territory. He has been told these beings are vetted, but he has not seen the evidence. Campbell writes that 'the adventure is always and everywhere a passage beyond the veil of the known into the unknown; the powers that watch at the boundary are dangerous; to deal with them is risky; yet for anyone with competence and courage the danger fades.' Kent has the competence (he asks the right questions). The platform must provide the evidence that allows his courage to follow. If the proposal interface shows only a guest name and dates without the vetting data Kent cares about, his due-diligence nature will force him to reject or defer -- not because the guest is unqualified, but because he cannot verify the qualification.",

These three categories should be the primary data points in every proposal view. (3) Make the vetting evidence scannable in under 30 seconds. The due-diligence host does not need to read every detail, but they need to see that the details exist and are available. A collapsed section with 'View full vetting report' serves both the scanner and the deep reader. (4) Show the payment guarantee alongside the proposal.

Kent is defining the terms under which he is willing to participate. Campbell's framework reveals why this matters: 'The passage of the threshold is a form of self-annihilation.' Kent must give up some control to participate in Split Lease, but he needs to retain control over the boundaries that define his identity as a careful, standards-driven property owner. If the platform forces him to accept terms that violate his boundaries (short stays he considers beneath his standards), the self-annihilation is not transformative but destructive. Frederick's response -- 'you can also set your listing for longer than that' (09:49) -- resolves the concern in principle but does not demonstrate it. Kent has no evidence that the platform actually supports his preference until he sees it in the listing interface. If the listing wizard defaults to a 6-week minimum that Kent must manually override, the platform has already violated his boundary.",
      "solution": "Design the platform to surface and respect host control boundaries as first-class configuration options, not as exceptions to override. This means: (1) During listing creation, prominently surface the minimum stay duration as an early, primary configuration choice. Do not bury it in advanced settings. Kent's minimum stay preference is not a detail -- it is a precondition for participation. (2) Default to the host's stated preference when known. If the sales call captured that Kent wants longer stays, the listing wizard should pre-set the minimum to match his stated preference, not the platform default. (3) Prevent proposals that violate host boundaries from reaching the host. If Kent sets a 3-month minimum, he should never see a 6-week proposal. Showing proposals that violate his stated constraints signals that the platform does not respect his boundaries. (4) Surface the boundary in the active lease dashboard. Show 'Your minimum stay: 3 months' as a visible setting that the host can verify and adjust, reinforcing that they retain control over this aspect of their participation.",

      "title": "Make the Herald's Credibility Verifiable Within 60 Seconds",
      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation"],
      "problem": "Kent's very first substantive questions after hearing the pitch are about credibility: 'What's your background?' (02:38), redirected immediately to 'your real estate background' (02:38), then 'how old is this company?' (08:11), and 'how do I check you out?' (06:16). Campbell describes the herald figure as the one who 'appears suddenly as guide, marking a new period, a new stage, in the biography.' But the herald must be credible for the call to adventure to register. Frederick honestly answers that he does not have a real estate background (02:50), redirecting to the CEO's experience. Kent accepts this but adds 'I would be interested in that' (03:25) -- he needs the credibility chain to extend beyond the person on the phone. The platform currently has no rapid credibility verification mechanism. A host who discovers Split Lease independently (not through a call) has even less to go on than Kent did. The platform must make its credibility -- company age, founder background, track record, verifiable success stories -- verifiable within the first 60 seconds of any encounter, whether that encounter is a phone call or a website visit.",
      "solution": "Design a credibility verification layer that is accessible within 60 seconds of first contact, through any channel. This means: (1) On the website, the first screen a host encounters should include verifiable credibility markers: company age (5 years), number of successful leases, founder background, and a link to success stories with real names and measurable outcomes. These are not marketing claims -- they are verifiable facts. (2) For phone outreach, the agent should have a one-sentence credibility script that covers the three things Kent needed to know: who we are (Split Lease, 5 years in NYC), who founded it (property management background), and how to verify (success stories URL). This should be deliverable in under 15 seconds. (3) Make the credibility chain auditable. Kent wanted to verify not just the agent but the company. The website should show the founder's background, the team, and the company's operating history in a way that a due-diligence host can verify independently (LinkedIn profiles, press mentions, verifiable addresses). (4) Success stories must be specific and verifiable. Not 'hosts love us' but 'Kent from Brooklyn listed in March 2024 and has earned $X over Y months.' The more specific the story, the more it resists the due-diligence host's skepticism.",
