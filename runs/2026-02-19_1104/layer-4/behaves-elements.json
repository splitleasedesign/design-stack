      "problem": "Kent requests protective artifacts at specific threshold moments: success stories (06:16), sample contracts (09:24), policy documents (10:02). Campbell calls these 'amulets against the dragon forces he is about to pass.' When the host clicks to view a threshold artifact (success story, contract sample, vetting report), the current pattern would be a full page load or a modal that pops in abruptly. Neither respects the psychological weight of the moment -- the host is reaching for protection before crossing a threshold. If the artifact loads slowly, the host experiences a gap between their courage and their evidence, exactly when Campbell's framework says the hero is most vulnerable. If it loads abruptly, the transition feels transactional rather than protective. The lower layers (L2 communicates-009, L3 looks-018) define what the artifact card contains and how it looks. This layer defines how it behaves: what happens in the 0-800ms between the host's click and the artifact's full availability, and how state transitions within the artifact (collapsed to expanded, summary to full document) should feel.",
      "solution": "When the host triggers an artifact reveal (clicks 'View contract,' expands a vetting category, opens a success story), the interaction should begin with an optimistic reveal of the artifact card's container and summary (0-120ms), followed by a cascade of the supporting evidence elements (120-400ms). The container appears immediately with its left accent border and title -- the host sees the protective shape before the protective content. Then the summary text, the access trigger, and any supporting data cascade in from top to bottom with staggered timing. This mirrors Campbell's amulet delivery: the hero first sees the amulet, then learns its purpose, then takes it. If the full document requires a network fetch, the summary layer remains interactive and the fetch indicator appears within the expanded section only -- never replacing the summary the host has already processed. On failure, the artifact card remains visible with the summary intact and an inline error with retry, never collapsing back to the pre-reveal state (the host already committed the courage to look -- do not retract the threshold).",

      "problem": "Kent's 12-question sequence during the call follows a natural evidence-gathering hierarchy: proposition, credibility, economics, vetting, commitment, verification (L2 communicates-008). The evidence ladder information architecture presents these answers in sequence. But the interaction question is: how does the host advance through the ladder? If the entire ladder is visible at once, the host faces a wall of text that undermines the sequential trust-building Campbell's Departure describes. If the ladder requires explicit clicks to advance, it feels gated and patronizing -- the due-diligence host wants to move at their own pace, not the platform's. The interaction must create forward momentum without forced gates, allowing the host to advance naturally through scroll behavior while ensuring each rung gets its moment of attention before the next one appears.",
      "solution": "The evidence ladder uses scroll-triggered progressive disclosure. Each rung becomes fully visible as the host scrolls it into the viewport's focus zone (the central 60% of the screen). The rung above fades to 80% opacity and translates up slightly (-4px), and the rung below shows only its headline as a 'next answer' preview at reduced opacity (50%). This creates a reading tunnel effect where the current rung is dominant and adjacent rungs provide context. The host advances by scrolling naturally -- no buttons, no gates, no explicit 'next' actions. However, each rung's entrance is animated: it translates from 12px below its final position and fades from 0 to full opacity over 300ms using the tokens.json 'out' easing. This entrance animation provides the 'moment of attention' that each answer deserves. The credibility triad strip (L3 looks-019) at the top of the ladder is always visible -- it does not scroll with the content, acting as a persistent trust anchor while the host descends through the evidence.",

The L3 looks-020 vetting evidence stack presents four categories (employment, financial, documents, references) with status pips and expandable detail. The interaction challenge is: how do these categories expand and collapse, and what feedback does the host receive during the transition? If all four expand simultaneously, the proposal view becomes a wall of data that overwhelms rather than reassures. If expansion is slow or unclear about which category opened, the host loses the spatial relationship between the status pip they trusted and the evidence beneath it. Campbell writes that 'the adventure is always and everywhere a passage beyond the veil of the known into the unknown; the powers that watch at the boundary are dangerous; to deal with them is risky; yet for anyone with competence and courage the danger fades.' Each category expansion is a micro-passage from status (known) to evidence (previously unknown). The interaction must make the danger fade progressively, not all at once.",
      "solution": "Each vetting category expands independently with a status-anchored interaction: the status pip and category label remain fixed at the top of the expanding section, and the evidence content pushes downward from beneath them.

Expansion uses a height-auto animation with the 'out' easing at 250ms. Collapse is faster at 180ms. Only one category can be expanded at a time by default (accordion behavior), but a 'show all details' toggle at the top of the stack allows the host to expand all categories simultaneously for a comprehensive view. When a category expands, the other categories' pips remain visible above and below, providing persistent status context.

If the host drags a minimum stay slider from 6 weeks to 3 months, what feedback do they receive, how quickly, and through what mechanism? Without live consequence feedback, the host is configuring in the dark -- they set a value but cannot understand its impact until they see proposals (or fail to see them).

The consequence statement updates immediately (0ms perceived delay) using a crossfade transition (150ms). The quantitative indicator uses a 300ms debounce after the host stops adjusting, then updates with a brief number-counting animation (400ms) to draw attention to the data change.

Campbell warns: 'Refusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative.' The L2 communicates-011 and L3 looks-023 layers define the information architecture and visual design of the sequenced delivery. The interaction challenge is: what behavioral logic governs the delivery timing, and how does the system respond to host engagement or disengagement? A static sequence (Day 1: success stories, Day 2: contract, Day 4: policies) does not adapt to the host's actual behavior. If Kent opens and reads the success stories within an hour, waiting until Day 2 to send the contract wastes momentum. If Kent does not open the success stories by Day 2, sending the contract on schedule overwhelms a host who has not processed the first delivery. The interaction pattern must be responsive to the host's engagement signals.",
      "solution": "The post-call delivery sequence operates on an engagement-responsive cadence rather than a fixed calendar. The logic is: (1) First delivery (success stories) sends within 1 hour of the call, always. (2) Each subsequent delivery triggers when the host engages with the previous one (opens the email, clicks the document link, or spends more than 30 seconds on the linked page), plus a minimum 18-hour cooldown to prevent overwhelming. (3) If the host does not engage with a delivery within 48 hours, a gentle re-engagement ping fires: a brief message from the agent referencing the specific document ('Hi Kent, did you get a chance to look at the success stories? Happy to walk through any of them with you.'). (4) If the host does not engage after the re-engagement ping within another 48 hours, the sequence pauses and the agent is notified for a personal follow-up call. (5) The sequence progress indicator (L3 looks-023) updates in real time across all channels -- if the host opened the success stories via email, their in-app progress bar reflects this. Each delivery notification uses the same visual template (agent attribution, sequence indicator, artifact card, guidance note, next-step preview) to create a predictable rhythm that the host learns to trust.",

The interaction question is: how does the agent banner behave across different contexts and states? A static banner showing 'Frederick, your agent' is better than nothing, but it does not maintain the living, responsive quality of Frederick's presence during the call.

Status examples: on the dashboard, 'Available until 6pm EST -- message me anytime'; on the proposal view, 'I vetted this guest -- take a look at their profile'; on the listing wizard boundary step, 'Set your terms -- I will enforce them on every proposal'; after a re-engagement ping, 'I sent you the contract yesterday -- let me know your questions.' Each status update uses a subtle crossfade transition (200ms) so the text change is perceivable but not distracting. The contact button in the banner updates its label contextually: 'Message' by default, 'Call' when a scheduled call is imminent, 'Text' if the host indicated texting preference (as Kent did at 10:37).
