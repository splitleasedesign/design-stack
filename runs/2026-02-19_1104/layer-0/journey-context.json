    "lens_summary": "The due-diligence host's journey mirrors Campbell's Departure sequence: the host receives the call to adventure (discovery), actively refuses until protective evidence is provided (evaluation), receives supernatural aid through human agents and social proof (onboarding), and must cross the threshold of commitment before being transformed into an active participant in the platform."

  "phases": {
    "discovery": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Kent's discovery phase maps directly to Campbell's 'Call to Adventure.' Campbell writes that 'the call rings up the curtain, always, on a mystery of transfiguration — a rite, or moment, of spiritual passage' and that 'the familiar life horizon has been outgrown.' Kent was found on a listing site (Craigslist or similar), meaning he was already in a state of seeking — his current rental approach was insufficient, making him ripe for the herald's summons. Frederick (the agent) is the herald figure who 'appears suddenly as guide, marking a new period, a new stage, in the biography.' Kent's very first substantive response — 'tell me what you guys do' (01:13) — shows he has heard the call but needs the herald to articulate the adventure before he can respond. Campbell notes the call can begin 'as a mere blunder' or by 'some passing phenomenon' that 'catches the wandering eye and lures one away from the frequented paths of man.' For Kent, the outreach was that passing phenomenon.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional_state": "Curious but guarded. Kent opens with light humor about the echo (00:28-00:37), establishing rapport but maintaining distance. His first real question is an open prompt — 'tell me what you guys do' — which signals willingness to listen without commitment. Campbell's framework would describe this as the moment when 'the old concepts, ideals, and emotional patterns no longer fit' but the hero has not yet accepted the new path.",
        "knowledge_level": "Minimal knowledge of Split Lease specifically. Kent knows nothing about the platform's model, fee structure, or credibility. He must be told everything from scratch. However, he is an experienced property owner — his questions throughout the call reveal deep knowledge of real estate operations (vetting, contracts, payment cycles, minimum stays).",

Each question is a threshold test — Kent is probing the boundary between the known (his current approach) and the unknown (Split Lease), seeking evidence that crossing is safe. Campbell's Refusal is not always permanent; it can be a necessary testing phase that the hero must pass through before crossing the threshold.

The critical design question is: when and how does the platform take over from Frederick? If the handoff is abrupt (Frederick disappears, the platform appears), Kent loses his protective figure.
