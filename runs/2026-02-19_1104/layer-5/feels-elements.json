      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation"],
      "problem": "Kent's entire emotional posture during the call is one of careful, structured inquiry. He asks 12 questions in 12 minutes -- about background (02:38), fees (04:22), vetting (04:56), references (06:16), company age (08:11), contracts (09:24), minimum stays (09:31). The platform's natural response to this behavior is to treat it as sales resistance -- objections to be overcome, friction to be smoothed away. But Kent's questioning is not resistance. It is the emotional mechanism by which he builds the internal confidence to proceed. Campbell's Refusal of the Call is not a permanent rejection: 'Not all who hesitate are lost. The psyche has many secrets in reserve.' Kent hesitates productively. If the platform responds with urgency, pressure, or cheerful simplification, it violates the emotional contract Kent is building. He will feel patronized, not reassured. The target emotion is not excitement or curiosity -- it is respect. Kent needs to feel that the platform recognizes his thoroughness as an asset, not an obstacle.",
      "solution": "Every touchpoint during discovery and evaluation should communicate: 'We expect you to ask hard questions and we have prepared answers.' The emotional register is calm evidence, not enthusiastic persuasion. Copy should anticipate the due-diligence host's questions and answer them before they are asked, using factual language that treats the host as an intelligent evaluator. The platform's tone should mirror Frederick's best moment: when Kent said 'I wanna do my due diligence' (09:10), Frederick responded 'Yeah, for sure. Makes total sense. And I totally understand' (09:19). That response -- validation without defensiveness -- is the emotional template for every evaluation-phase interaction.",

Any tonal response that treats this as a problem to solve rather than a process to support will damage the emotional relationship."

      "problem": "Kent's call ends with 'I look forward to your information. And I'll review it and I'll get back to you' (11:17). This is the emotional equivalent of the hero receiving amulets from the supernatural aid figure and then being left alone at the edge of the unknown. Campbell writes: 'Having responded to his own call, and continuing to follow courageously as the consequences unfold, the hero finds all the forces of the unconscious at his side.' But the keyword is 'continuing' -- the hero must feel that the journey is ongoing, not paused. After the call, Kent enters a void: he has links, documents, and a phone number, but no structure, no timeline, and no external reason to re-engage. The emotional risk is not that Kent forgets about Split Lease -- his due-diligence nature ensures he will review the materials. The risk is that the review feels lonely, unguided, and disconnected from the human warmth of the call. The momentum of Frederick's voice is replaced by the silence of a document folder. The host's emotional state shifts from engaged dialogue to solitary evaluation, and without deliberate design, this shift feels like abandonment.",
      "solution": "The post-call period should feel like a continuation of the conversation, not the end of it. Each follow-up touchpoint should carry Frederick's voice and presence, reference specific moments from the call, and guide Kent through the review in the same warm, factual register he experienced during the conversation. The emotional goal is that Kent never feels he has been handed off from a person to a system. He should feel that Frederick is still walking alongside him, just at a slight distance -- available when needed, not hovering, but visibly present. Campbell's supernatural aid figure provides amulets and then the hero 'goes forward' -- but the figure does not vanish. The platform must embody this continued presence.",

      "problem": "Kent's first substantive questions are about credibility, not about the product. He asks about background (02:38), real estate background specifically (02:38), company age (08:11), and independent verification (06:16). His emotional sequence is: 'Who are you? Can I trust you? Only then tell me what you offer.' Campbell describes the herald as a figure who 'appears suddenly as guide, marking a new period, a new stage, in the biography' -- but the herald must create 'irresistible fascination,' and for the due-diligence host, fascination comes from credibility, not charisma. Kent's relief when he learns the company is five years old -- 'So it's not like you're a startup' (08:19) -- reveals that a single credibility data point can shift his entire emotional posture from guarded to open. The problem is that most platform experiences lead with the proposition (what we do) or the aspiration (what you could earn) rather than the credential (who we are and why you should listen). This sequence triggers the wrong emotion first: excitement before trust, which the due-diligence host interprets as salesmanship rather than substance.",
      "solution": "Lead every first-contact experience with the credibility triad: company age, founder domain expertise, and verifiable track record. These three data points should be the first things the host encounters -- before the proposition, before the earning potential, before any call to action. The emotional goal is that the host's first feeling is 'these people are legitimate,' not 'this sounds too good to be true.' Campbell's Call to Adventure only succeeds when the herald is credible: 'That which has to be faced, and is somehow profoundly familiar to the unconscious -- though unknown, surprising, and even frightening to the conscious personality -- makes itself known.' The unknown can only make itself known through a trusted messenger. Establish the messenger's credentials first, then deliver the message.",

The emotional function of a sample contract is not 'read this legal document' but 'here is proof that your rights are codified and enforceable.'

This is not a negotiable preference -- it is a statement about who Kent is as a property owner. Campbell's Belly of the Whale describes the hero's entry into the unknown as 'a form of self-annihilation' -- the old identity must partially dissolve for the new identity to emerge. But Kent is negotiating the terms of his self-annihilation. He will accept: platform-mediated vetting, third-party payments, strangers in his property. He will NOT accept: short stays that violate his standards. If the platform treats this boundary as a setting to be configured -- or worse, as an obstacle to guest supply -- it misreads the emotional weight entirely. This is not about stay duration; it is about the host's sense of control over their own transformation. When the platform defaults to its preferred minimum and asks the host to change it, the emotional message is: 'Our terms first, your terms second.' For the due-diligence host, this inverts the power relationship and damages trust.",
      "solution": "Treat host control boundaries as primary identity expressions that the platform exists to serve, not as parameters to be optimized for supply. The emotional register when presenting boundary configuration should be: 'You set the rules. We enforce them.' The listing wizard should lead with boundaries before property details or pricing, communicating that the host's terms are the foundation of their participation, not an afterthought. When the host sets a minimum stay, the immediate feedback should confirm: 'Only proposals meeting your terms will reach you.' This is the platform saying: 'Your identity is safe with us. We will not ask you to be someone you are not.'",

The anxiety is palpable -- 'these people' are strangers who will enter his property, use his belongings, and occupy his space. Campbell describes the territory beyond the threshold as 'a place of strangely fluid and polymorphous beings, unimaginable torments, superhuman deeds, and impossible delight.' Each guest proposal is an encounter with one of these 'polymorphous beings' -- a real person whose qualities are unknown until the platform makes them known. Frederick answers with a process description (rental application, information collection, document checks, lease signing), but process descriptions are claims about capability, not evidence of results. When Kent eventually sees his first proposal, the emotional question is not 'was this person vetted?' but 'what exactly did the vetting find?' If the proposal shows only a name, dates, and a green 'Verified' badge, the unknown remains unknown. The badge is a claim, not evidence. For the due-diligence host, claims without evidence amplify anxiety rather than reducing it.",

When Kent sees 'Employed at [company type] for [duration], verified [date]' and 'Financial check: income exceeds 3x rental amount,' the unknown guest becomes known.
