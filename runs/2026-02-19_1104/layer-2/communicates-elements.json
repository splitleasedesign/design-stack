      "title": "Due-Diligence Evidence Ladder: Present Answers in the Host's Natural Question Sequence",
      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "onboarding"],
      "problem": "Kent's questions during his 12-minute call follow a predictable, hierarchical sequence: (1) what do you do? (01:13), (2) what is your background? (02:38), (3) how does payment work? (03:25), (4) who pays fees? (04:22), (5) how do you vet people? (04:56), (6) what do you need from me? (05:41), (7) how do I check you out? (06:16), (8) when do payments come? (07:02), (9) what should I know? (07:59), (10) how old is the company? (08:11), (11) can I see a contract? (09:24), (12) what are the minimum stay terms? (09:31). This sequence is not random -- it follows Campbell's hero journey: the Call to Adventure (what is this?), then the Refusal pattern (prove it to me), then the Supernatural Aid request (give me protective artifacts). The current platform and agent process have no mechanism to anticipate this sequence or present answers proactively. Kent must extract each answer through conversation, and a host who visits the website alone has no Frederick to interrogate. If the information architecture does not present these answers in the due-diligence host's natural order, the host will either abandon (because the answer they need next is not findable) or call the agent (because only a human conversation supports their questioning rhythm).",
      "solution": "Structure the evaluation-phase information architecture as a sequential evidence ladder that mirrors the due-diligence host's natural question hierarchy. Each rung answers one question and naturally leads to the next. The ladder operates on any surface -- a landing page, an email sequence, or a guided onboarding flow. The sequence is: (1) What Split Lease does (proposition, 2 sentences), (2) Who is behind it (founder background, company age, location), (3) How money flows (host sets rate, guests pay above it, payments every 4 weeks), (4) How guests are vetted (application, financial check, document verification, lease signing), (5) What the host provides (listing, availability, property access), (6) How to verify independently (success stories, references, sample contracts). Each rung is visible without scrolling beyond the previous rung. The host never faces a wall of information or a blank search -- the next answer is always the next visible element. Campbell's Departure sequence validates this order: the hero first hears the call (proposition), then tests the herald (credibility), then assesses the risk (money and vetting), then considers the commitment (what is required), then demands protective artifacts (verification materials).",

Why: Kent's questions flow in a natural hierarchy where each answer enables the next question.

Campbell calls these 'amulets against the dragon forces he is about to pass.' Frederick delivers all of them in a single email batch, which is the equivalent of giving the hero all the amulets at once with no instruction on when to use each one. The result is a document dump that overwhelms rather than protects. Kent must self-sort through multiple document types (success stories, rental agreement, supplemental agreement, credit card authorization form) with no guidance on which one addresses his current concern. A due-diligence host will read them all; a less thorough host will read none. Neither outcome is optimal. The information architecture must deliver each artifact at the moment it is needed, not before and not after.",
      "solution": "Map each phase boundary to the specific fear it triggers and the specific artifact that neutralizes that fear. Then deliver the artifact at that boundary, not in a batch. The mapping is: (1) Evaluation boundary (should I engage further?): the artifact is success stories -- third-party evidence that the platform works. Surface this immediately after the proposition is understood, before any commitment is requested. (2) Onboarding boundary (should I provide my information?): the artifact is the sample contract -- proof that the legal framework protects the host. Surface this before asking the host to create an account or provide property details. (3) Listing creation boundary (should I make my property visible?): the artifact is the rental agreement preview -- showing the host exactly what a guest will sign. Surface this within the listing wizard, before the listing goes live. (4) Proposal boundary (should I accept this stranger?): the artifact is the vetting evidence for the specific guest -- employment, financial check, document verification. Surface this within the proposal view, not behind a separate screen. Each artifact is phase-specific, fear-specific, and timing-specific.

His relief when he learns the company is 5 years old -- 'So it's not like you're a startup' (08:19) -- reveals that company age is a binary trust gate: if the company is too new, every subsequent claim is discounted. Campbell's herald figure must be credible for the Call to Adventure to register: 'That which has to be faced, and is somehow profoundly familiar to the unconscious -- though unknown, surprising, and even frightening to the conscious personality -- makes itself known.' But it can only make itself known through a credible herald. The current platform and agent process place credibility information deep in the evaluation -- Kent had to ask for it repeatedly. For hosts who discover Split Lease through the website rather than a phone call, credibility information may be buried on an About page, forcing the host to seek it out.

The host should know WHO they are dealing with before they know WHAT they are being offered.

These three data points answer Kent's three credibility questions without him having to ask. (2) For phone outreach, the agent opens with a credibility statement before explaining the proposition: 'This is Frederick from Split Lease -- we have been matching hosts with part-of-week tenants in New York for five years.' (3) Each credibility marker must be verifiable: the founder's LinkedIn, the company's registration, the success stories. Due-diligence hosts will verify.

Campbell warns that 'Refusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative. Walled in boredom, hard work, or culture, the subject loses the power of significant affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved.' The post-call void is where this conversion happens -- not because the host refuses, but because the momentum of the call dissipates without external structure. Kent's due-diligence personality means he WILL review the materials, but on his own timeline, which may be days or never.

This is the easiest document to consume and the most emotionally compelling. It keeps the momentum alive without overwhelming. (2) Day 2: send the sample contract with a note: 'Here is the contract you asked about. Take a look and let me know if anything stands out.' This delivers the artifact Kent explicitly requested, on a schedule that gives him time to read the success stories first. (3) Day 4: send the policy documents and supplemental agreement as a package, with a summary note: 'Here is the full operational framework. The key things to look at are [X] and [Y].' This gives context and priority guidance rather than a raw document. (4) Day 5-7: scheduled follow-up call or message: 'Have you had a chance to review?

Campbell's 'Belly of the Whale' describes participation as 'a form of self-annihilation' -- the host must surrender some autonomy to join the platform. But the surrender must be bounded. Kent will accept platform-mediated vetting, third-party payment processing, and unfamiliar tenants. He will NOT accept short stays that violate his standards. If the listing wizard defaults to a 6-week minimum and Kent must find and override this setting, the platform has already violated his boundary before he has even begun. Frederick's response -- 'you can also set your listing for longer than that' (09:49) -- resolves the concern verbally but does not demonstrate it in the product.

These are the host's safety parameters -- the platform promises to enforce them. (2) Step 2 (Property): unit details, features, photos -- the descriptive content. (3) Step 3 (Pricing): rate setting, payment preferences. (4) Step 4 (Review): summary showing all boundaries, details, and pricing before publication. The boundary step comes first because Kent's evaluation pattern shows that he sets conditions before engaging. He set his due-diligence condition ('I wanna do my due diligence before I agree to anything' at 09:10) before reviewing the materials. He set his minimum stay condition ('I don't wanna do anything that short' at 09:46) before agreeing to create a listing. The platform must honor this pattern: boundaries first, content second.",
