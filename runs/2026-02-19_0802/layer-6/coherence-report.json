The existing element (works-004 from the library) prescribes agent name/photo on the platform to bridge human trust to digital trust. The new element (works-001) extends this by prescribing that the MATCH be shown before the platform — leading with specific guests, not platform features.",
      "combined_evidence": "Library evidence (andreas-call.txt): Bryant's name must appear on the platform to bridge trust.

Resolution: the single-session flow MUST include micro-decompression moments (progress confirmations, 'looks good' checkpoints) within its compressed timeline.",
