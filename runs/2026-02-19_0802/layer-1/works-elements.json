      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "onboarding"],
      "problem": "Traditional platform onboarding asks the host to create an account, then a listing, then wait for matches. But hard-side hosts like Dimitri have zero motivation to invest in a generic platform. Dimitri only engaged because Bryant had specific guests (Ariel and Amber) for his specific apartment. If the platform had asked him to sign up first and browse later, he would never have responded. The Cold Start Problem is not 'build it and they will come' — it's 'bring the match, then build the platform around it.'",
      "solution": "Reverse the onboarding sequence: present the specific match first, then onboard the host into the platform as a way to facilitate that match. (1) The first platform touchpoint must show Dimitri his specific apartment with Ariel and Amber already interested. (2) Account creation happens inline with reviewing the match, not as a prerequisite. (3) The listing is auto-populated from agent call notes, not built from scratch. (4) The platform introduces itself as 'the way to make this specific deal happen securely,' not as 'a marketplace for subletting.'",

But for the hard side of the network, this creates a trust gap: they don't trust the platform's vetting because they don't trust the platform yet.

      "solution": "Show both the platform's verification AND the information the host needs for personal verification, side by side. (1) When presenting a guest, show Split Lease's vetting results (credit check, references, ID verification) alongside the guest's personal details that the host would traditionally request (name, ID, employment). (2) Frame the platform's vetting as complementary to the host's judgment, not a replacement. Language like 'We've already checked — here's what we found, and here's the full picture for you' bridges institutional and personal trust.
