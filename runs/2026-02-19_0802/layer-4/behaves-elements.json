Chen's 'Magic Moment' concept shows that users must experience the product's value before they invest in the infrastructure.",
      "solution": "Present the match as an interactive preview accessible via a magic link (no account required). (1) Agent sends a personalized link after the call. (2) Link opens directly to the match page: Ariel and Amber's profiles + Dimitri's pre-filled property. (3) Account creation is triggered only when the host takes an action that requires it (accept proposal, upload photos, view full documents). (4) The magic link persists for 7 days and bookmarks progress.",
