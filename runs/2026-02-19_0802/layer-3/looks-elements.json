      "problem": "Agent-recruited hosts like Dimitri arrive at the platform expecting a continuation of a human conversation, not a corporate SaaS interface. If the first visual impression is a generic marketplace with stock photos and marketing copy, it triggers the same 'third party' distrust that Dimitri expressed on the call. The visual design must feel personal and specific, not institutional and generic.",
      "solution": "Use human-scale visual elements: agent photos, guest avatars, property thumbnails. Minimize abstract branding elements (logos, hero sections, feature grids) in favor of concrete, person-specific content. The visual hierarchy should prioritize faces > places > actions > text. Typography should feel like a well-designed email from Bryant, not a marketplace landing page.",

(2) Amber-tinted background = something needs attention, details below. (3) Red-tinted background = action required now.

Conversely, if it looks like a pressure tactic (countdown timers, red urgency badges), it triggers the 'third party' distrust.",
      "solution": "Use a gentle timeline visual that shows deal progression with dates. (1) Horizontal or vertical progress line showing: agent call (completed) -> host review (current) -> guest confirmation (next) -> deal signed (end). (2) Dates on each step, including the host's stated deadline as a soft reference point. (3) No countdown timers or red urgency.
