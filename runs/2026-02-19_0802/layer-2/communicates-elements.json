      "problem": "The current listing creation flow presents empty forms before showing demand. For hard-side hosts like Dimitri who were recruited by agents with a specific match, this inverts the information hierarchy. Dimitri's motivation is not 'I want to list my apartment' — it's 'I want to see if Ariel and Amber are right for my apartment.' The information architecture must lead with what the host cares about (the match) and follow with what the platform needs (the listing).",
      "solution": "Restructure the first-time host experience to lead with the specific match. Scan order: (1) Guest profiles with names, verification status, and interest details, (2) The host's property as the agent described it (pre-filled), (3) What the host needs to do to make this deal happen (minimal steps). This is a demand-led information architecture: show the value first, collect the input second.",

(2) Real-time push notifications only for action-required items (lease issue, payment failure). (3) In-app dashboard designed for 10-second timezone-shifted check-ins: status headline first, details below fold.
