      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "Dimitri's third-party skepticism ('I usually don't deal with third parties') is often treated by platforms as a conversion barrier to overcome. But from the host's perspective, this skepticism is earned — after 8 years of managing his own sublease process, he has a system that works. The emotional error is treating his skepticism as resistance rather than intelligence. If the platform tries to overcome his skepticism with persuasion, it confirms his worry. If it respects his skepticism by giving him MORE information and control, it earns his trust.",
      "solution": "Design the emotional arc to validate the host's skepticism explicitly. (1) Language should acknowledge: 'You've been managing your apartment for 8 years. You know what works.' (2) The platform positions itself as additive, not replacing: 'Here's everything you'd normally check, plus our additional verification.' (3) Control is never taken away — the host can always revert to direct dealing with the agent as backup. (4) The emotional goal is not 'trust us' but 'verify us, and decide for yourself.'",
