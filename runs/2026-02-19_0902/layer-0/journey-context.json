The platform's assumption about how hosts find it must be stated as a hypothesis and tested: 'We believe hosts will discover Split Lease through our website/marketing.

The Lean UX principle of removing waste demands: if the host has already created a listing on another platform, the Split Lease listing creation process should import or reference that work, not ignore it.

The Lean UX lens frames retention as the ultimate hypothesis test: 'We believe that hosts who complete a successful lease will list again. We will know this is true when X% of hosts create a second listing within 30 days of lease completion.' For Robbie, however, the retention hypothesis has a prerequisite: the definition of 'successful' must match his definition, not the platform's. If payments were on time but required him to check repeatedly, contact support, or experience anxiety about timing, his subjective experience of the lease is 'stressful' even if the objective outcome (payments delivered) was achieved. The Lean UX distinction between output (payment delivered) and outcome (host felt confident and secure throughout) applies directly here. Retention is predicted by the outcome, not the output.",

Bryant provides increasingly detailed explanations but does not confirm that Robbie understands. The Lean UX framework (Ch 3, Hypotheses) demands treating this as a failed hypothesis: 'We believe verbal explanation of delayed payment release will achieve host comprehension.' The market feedback (3 re-asks) invalidates it. If this gap is not closed at onboarding (when documents are reviewed), it will compound at pricing (where per-night rates feel disconnected from monthly income), at proposal management (where payment is not immediate upon acceptance), at active lease (where payment releases on a schedule, not on demand), and at retention (where the cumulative anxiety of unclear payment timing drives the host back to Craigslist's simpler model)."

      "evidence": "Robbie's mental model is: post listing → receive inquiries → contract → immediate payment → tenant moves in. Split Lease's model is: agent matches guests → host is contacted → evaluation call → documents sent → host onboards → listing created → per-night pricing set → proposal received → terms negotiated → acceptance → documents signed → first night → payment released. Every phase transition introduces a new point of conflict between these models. The Lean UX Business Assumptions Worksheet (Ch 3) asks: 'My biggest product risk is ___.' For hosts like Robbie, the biggest risk is that the platform's model is so different from the host's expectation that comprehension fails before conversion. This is not a UI problem — it is a model-translation problem that requires hypothesis testing at each transition: 'We believe [this explanation/interface/document] will bridge the gap between the traditional landlord model and the Split Lease model at [this specific transition].'"

You feel the contract phone to, uh, to, to hold any property for you out loss'), 06:14 ('The contract has been fueled'), and 07:10 ('how many, something of the agreement you're talking about'). Each of these shows comprehension difficulty, not just expression difficulty. The Lean UX principle of continuous discovery (Ch 2) demands understanding not just what users do but why they do it. For Robbie, language difficulty is a hidden 'why' behind potential abandonment at every phase. A host who does not fully understand the words on the screen will not complete a 6-step wizard, set correct pricing, or review a proposal with confidence. The platform's untested assumption is that all hosts are fluent in English — this is a hypothesis that Robbie's case invalidates."

The Lean UX principle of shared understanding (Ch 2) requires that the team and the customer have a common understanding. But Robbie's shared understanding is with Bryant (a person), not with the platform (a product). When he encounters the platform for the first time, there is no shared understanding — he must build it from scratch, alone, in a second language. The Lean UX MVP concept (Ch 5) suggests the smallest thing you can build to bridge this gap: a landing page personalized with Bryant's name, Robbie's property details, and the specific terms discussed in the call. This MVP tests the hypothesis: 'We believe a personalized post-call landing page will reduce the human-to-digital trust gap.'"

Robbie's repeated demand for immediate payment confirmation (03:17, 04:06, 06:14) is not a complaint about a feature — it is an articulation of his desired outcome: certainty that he will be paid. The platform's response should not be to add a feature (e.g., a payment confirmation button) but to achieve the outcome (host feels certain of payment). This distinction applies across phases: at evaluation (does he believe payment is guaranteed?), at proposal management (does accepting a proposal feel like securing payment?), at active lease (does each payment release reinforce confidence?), and at retention (does the cumulative experience of reliable payment create loyalty?). Measuring payment confirmation anxiety — how often hosts check payment status, how often they contact support about payments, how many calls reference payment timing — is the continuous discovery mechanism for this outcome."
