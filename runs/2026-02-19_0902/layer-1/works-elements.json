      "problem": "The platform treats its delayed-payment-release model (payment after first night of booking) as an established fact and explains it once, verbally. Robbie's call proves this is a failed hypothesis: he was told the payment flow three times (03:25, 05:03, 06:37) and still reasserted his own contradictory model three times (03:17, 04:06, 06:14), each time more forcefully ('we have to confirm the payment immediately. The contract has been fueled'). The Lean UX framework demands that every untested assumption be stated as a hypothesis and validated with market feedback. The assumption 'hosts will understand delayed payment release after a verbal explanation' has been tested and invalidated by Robbie's call. Yet the platform has no alternative explanation mechanism, no visual aid, no hypothesis-testing infrastructure for this critical comprehension moment. The same failed explanation is repeated at evaluation (call), onboarding (documents), pricing (rate display), proposal management (acceptance flow), and active lease (payment schedule). Each repetition compounds the original failure because it uses the same framing that already did not work.",
      "solution": "Treat payment comprehension as a hypothesis to be tested at every phase, with distinct MVPs at each touchpoint. (1) At evaluation: state the hypothesis 'We believe a verbal explanation of delayed payment release will achieve host comprehension. We will know this is true when the host does not re-ask about payment timing after the initial explanation.' When invalidated (host re-asks), escalate to a visual MVP: a timeline diagram sent during or immediately after the call showing Contract Signed > Guest Moves In > First Night > Payment Released to You. (2) At onboarding: the agreement documents must contain a one-page visual payment timeline as the first page, not buried in legal language. Test whether hosts who receive the visual can correctly describe the payment flow back. (3) At pricing: show the monthly income amount prominently with a note 'Released to you after the first night of each month' directly adjacent to the number. (4) At proposal management: when the host accepts a proposal, show a confirmation that explicitly states when payment will arrive, in calendar format: 'Guest arrives March 1. Your payment of $1,600 will be released March 2.' (5) At active lease: the Leases page must show next payment date and amount as the primary information, not as a secondary detail. Each of these is a separate hypothesis with its own success criterion.",

The Lean UX principle 'Progress = Outcomes, Not Output' distinguishes between the feature (payment processing) and the business goal it serves (host confidence in payment). The platform currently measures the output: was the payment processed? Was it on time? But it does not measure the outcome: does the host feel secure? Robbie's call shows that even when Bryant explains the payment guarantee (06:37: 'the charges are pre-authorized on the credit card, which is why there's the guarantee'), Robbie does not feel secure -- he defers to documents (07:10). During the active lease, payments may be processed correctly every month, but if Robbie has to check, wonder, or worry, the outcome (security) is not achieved. Retention depends on the outcome, not the output. A host who received every payment on time but felt anxious about every one will not relist.",
      "solution": "Design the active lease experience to achieve the outcome (host confidence), not just the output (payment processing). (1) Proactive payment notifications: send the host a message BEFORE payment is due: 'Your $1,600 payment for March is scheduled for release on March 2.' This is the smallest MVP for payment security anxiety. (2) Day-of confirmation: 'Your $1,600 payment has been released today, March 2. You should see it in your account within [X] business days.' (3) Next-payment preview: immediately after confirming the current payment, show: 'Your next payment of $1,600 is scheduled for April 2.' This creates a continuous assurance loop. (4) Payment guarantee visibility: on the Leases page, display the guarantee status prominently: 'Payment Guaranteed by Split Lease' with a persistent badge, not a one-time notice. (5) Measure the outcome: track how often hosts check the Leases page for payment status, how often they contact support about payments, and how many call transcripts reference payment timing. These are the qualitative and quantitative signals that the outcome (confidence) is or is not being achieved. (6) For retention: at lease end, show lifetime earnings: 'Over 6 months, you earned $9,600 guaranteed by Split Lease.'

Each of these shows comprehension difficulty, not just expression difficulty. The Lean UX framework treats assumptions as hypotheses to be tested. The platform's untested assumption is that all hosts are fluent in English. Robbie invalidates this. Every interface that uses complex vocabulary, financial jargon, or multi-clause sentences will fail for hosts like Robbie. The language barrier is not a separate problem -- it is a multiplier that amplifies every other friction point. A payment explanation that confuses 20% of native speakers will confuse 60% of non-native speakers. A 6-step wizard that 75% of native speakers complete will be completed by fewer than 50% of non-native speakers. The Lean UX principle of continuous discovery demands understanding not just what users do but why. For Robbie, language difficulty is the hidden 'why' behind potential abandonment at every phase.",

(1) State the hypothesis: 'We believe our current interfaces are comprehensible to hosts whose first language is not English. We will know we're wrong when non-native speakers show lower completion rates or higher comprehension errors than native speakers.' (2) Run the test: for every critical flow (onboarding documents, listing wizard, pricing display, proposal acceptance), recruit 5 non-native English speaking hosts and observe them completing the task. Measure time, errors, and comprehension. (3) Design guidelines for language-accessible interfaces: maximum 8-word sentences for critical information, visual aids for every financial concept, no idioms or colloquialisms, consistent terminology (never alternate between 'guests' and 'tenants' or 'booking' and 'reservation'). (4) Use visual communication wherever possible: timelines instead of paragraphs, icons alongside labels, progress bars instead of step counts. (5) Provide a 'simple language' toggle that rewrites interface text at a lower reading level.
