      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "proposal_mgmt", "active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "Robbie's core emotional state throughout the call is payment anxiety. He asks about payment timing at 03:17, is explained the flow, then reasserts his own model at 04:06 ('this have to be confirmed immediately') and again at 06:14 ('we have to confirm the payment immediately. The contract has been fueled'). Three escalating attempts to resolve the same anxiety. Bryant's verbal reassurance ('even if a guest misses payment, you still get paid' at 06:52) does not resolve it -- Robbie defers to documents ('just send it to me and let me see' at 07:10). The anxiety is not about information (he was told the answer three times) but about certainty -- he cannot feel certain through words alone. The Lean UX framework distinguishes between output (payment explanation delivered) and outcome (host feels certain about payment). Bryant delivered the output three times. The outcome was never achieved. Every subsequent phase that touches money -- onboarding documents, pricing display, proposal acceptance, monthly payment release -- is an opportunity to either build or erode this certainty. If the platform treats payment assurance as a one-time event (explain it once, move on), it replicates the call's failure at scale. Certainty is not a fact to be communicated; it is an emotional state to be maintained.",
      "solution": "Design payment-related touchpoints to accumulate certainty rather than assert it. The emotional principle is: each interaction where money is mentioned must leave the host feeling MORE certain than before, never the same or less. At evaluation, the visual payment timeline (behaves-0902-001) replaces verbal promises with a spatial sequence the host can see and mentally walk through -- the feeling should be 'I can see exactly when my money arrives.' At onboarding, the plain-language summary (behaves-0902-003 retreat target) answers Robbie's three questions in his own words -- the feeling should be 'they heard what I was asking.' At proposal acceptance, the payment calendar shows every future payment with specific dates -- the feeling should be 'I know the exact days I get paid.' At active lease, the proactive notification cycle (behaves-0902-005) tells the host before they ask -- the feeling should be 'they told me before I had to wonder.' At retention, the lifetime earnings summary frames the entire experience as a fulfilled promise -- the feeling should be 'they kept every promise they made.' Each touchpoint is a deposit into a certainty account. The balance must only ever increase.",

      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation", "onboarding", "listing_creation"],
      "problem": "Robbie was found by Bryant on Craigslist, called by Bryant, and explained the model by Bryant. His entire experience of Split Lease is one human being who knows his name, his property, his rent, and his prospective guests. When Robbie encounters the platform for the first time -- through a follow-up email or a landing page -- the critical emotional question is not 'what does this platform do?' but 'does this platform know who I am?' If the first digital touchpoint is a generic login screen, a marketing page, or a signup form, the emotional answer is 'no, this platform does not know me.' The trust that Bryant built over 7 minutes is destroyed in 3 seconds. The Lean UX principle of shared understanding demands that team and customer share common knowledge. Bryant and Robbie share knowledge (property details, rent, guest names). The platform and Robbie share nothing -- unless the platform's first touchpoint explicitly echoes what Bryant and Robbie discussed. The emotional challenge is not information delivery but recognition: the host must feel 'they know me' before they encounter any demand ('sign up,' 'enter your details,' 'create a listing').",
      "solution": "Every first digital touchpoint must lead with recognition signals -- specific details that only someone who spoke to Robbie would know -- before presenting any action request. The emotional sequence is: recognition > confirmation > comfort > action. Recognition: 'Hi Robbie, this is Bryant' (the host sees a name they trust). Confirmation: 'Your renovated studio in East Village, $1,600/month' (the host sees their specific property details). Comfort: 'Ariel and Amber are ready to move forward' (the host sees the specific guest names from the call). Action: only after all three recognition signals are processed does the page present any request (review documents, create account, sign agreement). This sequence mirrors the pacing of human trust: you would not hand a stranger your keys, but you would hand them to someone who says 'Hi, I am Bryant's colleague, here about your East Village studio for Ariel and Amber.' The platform must earn the right to ask by first proving it knows. The Lean UX hypothesis: 'We believe hosts who see personalized recognition signals before action requests will convert at higher rates than hosts who encounter generic onboarding. We will know when click-to-first-action rate exceeds 40%.'",

It is a request for a lower-commitment engagement: 'I cannot process this right now, but I will engage if you simplify the ask.' Bryant correctly responds by saying 'I will send you my email' -- he matches Robbie's retreat by stepping down to a simpler interaction (email exchange) rather than pressing for immediate commitment. The platform, however, offers no equivalent graceful retreat. If Robbie stalls on a 6-step listing wizard, the options are: complete it or leave. If he stalls on a proposal acceptance form, the options are: accept or abandon. There is no 'just send it to me and let me see' button.

      "problem": "Robbie has already done the work of creating a listing. He has photos, a description, a price, and an address -- all previously assembled for Craigslist. When he encounters the platform's listing creation flow, the critical emotional question is: 'Do they respect the work I have already done, or do they expect me to start over?' Twice in two minutes (01:42, 02:49), Robbie offers to share his existing listing rather than describe his space from scratch. His emotional state is clear: 'I already did this work. Do not make me do it again.' The Lean UX principle of removing waste applies emotionally as well as operationally: making the host redo completed work is not just inefficient -- it is disrespectful. It signals that the platform does not care about the host's time or effort. For a host who is already cognitively depleted from a confusing evaluation call, being asked to recreate from scratch what they already built is the tipping point between 'I will give this a try' and 'this is not worth my time.'",
      "solution": "The listing creation experience must emotionally communicate: 'We know you have already done this work, and we are going to build on it, not throw it away.' The import path (behaves-0902-004) is the operational mechanism; the emotional principle is that reuse feels like respect and recreation feels like bureaucracy. When the host uploads photos or pastes a URL, the platform should respond immediately with visible evidence that it is using their content: thumbnails appearing, fields pre-populating, a draft forming before their eyes. The emotional arc is: 'They took what I gave them and turned it into something' -- not 'they gave me a blank form and told me to fill it out.' The verification step (reviewing a pre-populated draft) should feel like editing a letter, not writing one -- the cognitive and emotional burden of creation is on the platform, not the host. If the import cannot extract everything (dead URL, minimal photos), the platform should acknowledge what it has and what it needs: 'We got your photos and your rent amount from your call with Bryant. Just add your address to finish.' This framing ('we got most of it, just add the rest') is emotionally opposite to 'fill in all of the following fields.'",

      "problem": "Robbie's pricing mental model is a single, fixed number: '$1,600 a month' (02:22). He did not arrive at this through calculation -- it is a fact about his property, like its address. The platform, however, operates on per-night pricing. This creates a translation problem that the platform currently pushes onto the host: 'You think in months, but we need you to think in nights. Here is a blank field. Figure it out.' For Robbie -- a non-native English speaker who just spent 7 minutes confused about payment timing -- this translation task is not just difficult, it is emotionally threatening. If he enters the wrong nightly rate, he will receive less than $1,600/month. If he discovers a fee he did not expect, he will feel deceived. If the number on the Leases page does not match the number Bryant quoted, every fear from the evaluation call ('we have to confirm the payment immediately') will reignite. The Lean UX distinction between output and outcome applies: the output is 'host enters a nightly rate.' The outcome is 'host is confident they will receive $1,600/month.' The platform must optimize for the outcome by performing the translation itself and showing the host the answer, not the math problem.",

At listing creation, the host types '$1,600' once and the platform shows the nightly equivalent instantly: '= ~$53/night.' The host validates: 'yes, that adds up to my rent.' If there are fees, the platform shows the net income immediately: 'After service fee: $1,440/month.' No surprises. At proposal acceptance, the platform shows total lease income in monthly terms: 'This 3-month lease earns you $4,800 ($1,600/month x 3).' The host validates: 'yes, that is 3 times my rent.' At active lease, the payment notification says: 'Your $1,600 has been released.' The number never deviates from the anchor without explicit, immediate explanation.

Every time Robbie encounters a word he does not understand ('pre-authorized,' 'supplemental agreement,' 'disbursement'), he experiences a micro-exclusion: 'this was not written for someone like me.' Over a multi-step journey, these micro-exclusions accumulate into a macro-emotion: 'this platform is not for me.' The call provides direct evidence: at 04:06, Robbie's fragmented speech ('this me, where this have to be confirmed immediately. You feel the contract phone to, uh, to, to hold any property for you out loss') reveals not just confusion but effort -- he is working hard to participate in a conversation that is not meeting him where he is. At 06:14, 'The contract has been fueled' (likely meaning 'fulfilled') shows word-level processing strain. At 07:10, 'how many, something of the agreement you're talking about' shows that after 7 minutes, comprehension has not improved. The Lean UX framework's GOOB principle (Get Out of the Building) demands testing with actual users who might fail -- and Robbie is that user. The platform's untested assumption that all hosts are fluent in English is, for hosts like Robbie, an assumption that they do not belong.",
      "solution": "Treat plain language as an emotional inclusion strategy, not just a readability optimization. The emotional principle: every word the host reads should feel like it was written for them specifically -- not simplified down from a more sophisticated version, but composed from the start in clear, concrete terms. The 8-word maximum for critical sentences (from L2/L3) is the mechanical rule; the emotional intent behind it is: 'You should never feel excluded by our vocabulary.' Visual communication (timelines, icons, numbers) is the primary channel because it crosses language barriers. Text is the confirmation channel -- it restates what the visual already conveyed, using the same words the host used on the call. Terminology consistency is not just a usability rule but an emotional one: when the platform alternates between 'guests' and 'tenants,' the non-native speaker must determine whether these mean the same thing, and that determination costs cognitive effort that erodes confidence. When the platform uses one word consistently, the host learns it once and recognizes it everywhere. The emotional outcome is not just 'I understood' but 'I felt included in this process.'",

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "Robbie has alternatives. He was 'receiving so many people' interested in his space (00:03) through channels like Craigslist. He does not need Split Lease -- Split Lease needs him. His retention decision will not be based on features, brand loyalty, or switching costs. It will be based on one question: 'Was this better than doing it myself on Craigslist?' The Lean UX framework distinguishes between outputs (features delivered) and outcomes (goals achieved). Robbie's outcome criteria for retention is not 'the platform had good features' but 'I got paid $1,600 every month, on time, without hassle.' If payments were on time but required him to check the Leases page repeatedly, call support, or experience anxiety, his subjective experience is 'stressful' even if the objective outcome (payments delivered) was achieved. The Lean UX principle of measuring outcomes demands tracking not just whether payments were correct but whether the host felt confident, secure, and unburdened throughout the lease. The retention decision happens at lease end, but the inputs to that decision accumulate from the first interaction. Every kept promise (Bryant said '$1,600 after the first night' -- the platform delivered $1,600 after the first night) deposits into a trust account. Every broken or ambiguous promise ('approximately $1,600' that turns out to be $1,569) withdraws from it. The balance at lease end determines whether the host lists again.",
      "solution": "Design the active lease and retention experience to make promise fulfillment visible and cumulative. The emotional principle: every interaction during the active lease should feel like 'they are keeping the promise they made.' The payment notifications (behaves-0902-005) are the primary mechanism: each pre-notification, each day-of confirmation, each next-payment preview is evidence that the system works as promised. But the emotional design goes beyond notifications. At lease midpoint, show a progress summary: 'Halfway through your lease. 3 of 6 payments released, totaling $4,800. All on time, guaranteed.' This transforms the lease from a passive waiting period into an active record of promises kept. At lease end, show the lifetime summary: 'Over 6 months, you earned $9,600. Every payment on time. Guaranteed by Split Lease.' This is not just a receipt -- it is the emotional culmination of every promise made during the evaluation call, every payment notification sent during the active lease, and every moment of certainty accumulated along the way. The retention prompt that follows ('Ready to list your space again?') arrives at the peak of accumulated trust, not at the trough of lease-end uncertainty.",

The elements are ordered from the most emotionally critical (feels-0902-001: payment certainty -- the single emotional thread that runs through Robbie's entire journey from evaluation to retention) through the trust bridge (002), graceful retreat (003), import dignity (004), pricing translation (005), language inclusion (006), and cumulative trust for retention (007). The Lean UX lens shapes every element: emotions are treated as outcomes to be measured, not just feelings to be aspired to. Payment certainty is measured by check frequency and support contacts. Recognition is measured by click-through rates. Retreat effectiveness is measured by conversion of would-be abandonments into partial completions. Every emotional principle has a testable hypothesis."
