      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "pricing", "proposal_mgmt", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Robbie was told the payment flow three times during an 8-minute call (03:25, 05:03, 06:37) and reasserted his own contradictory model three times (03:17, 04:06, 06:14), each time more forcefully ('we have to confirm the payment immediately. The contract has been fueled'). The information was delivered as verbal narrative: 'the payment for the first 30 nights would be given to you after the first night of the booking.' This is a linear, temporal explanation that requires the listener to hold the full sequence in working memory while mapping it against their existing mental model. Robbie's existing model (contract signed = payment confirmed = property held) is structurally incompatible with Split Lease's model (contract signed > guest moves in > first night > payment released). The verbal explanation failed because it presented the sequence once and expected comprehension, while the Lean UX framework demands treating every explanation as a hypothesis to be tested with market feedback. The market feedback from Robbie's call is unambiguous: three re-asks constitute hypothesis invalidation. The current information architecture has no alternative to the failed verbal sequence -- no visual representation, no progressive confirmation, no testable variant of the payment explanation.",
      "solution": "Replace every verbal or text-paragraph payment explanation with a visual timeline that the host can scan in one glance. The timeline has exactly four nodes, left to right: (1) 'Agreements Signed' with a checkmark icon, (2) 'Guest Moves In' with a calendar icon, (3) 'First Night Completed' with a moon icon, (4) 'Your $1,600 Released' with a dollar icon and green highlight. Between each node, an arrow shows causation, not just sequence. The monthly amount ($1,600) appears at the endpoint because that is the host's anchor -- the number they are scanning for. This timeline is the primary information element on every screen where payment timing is relevant: the post-call landing page (onboarding), the pricing display, the proposal acceptance confirmation, and the Leases page payment schedule. Each deployment of the timeline is a separate hypothesis test: 'We believe this visual will achieve comprehension at [this phase]. We will know when [specific feedback].' The timeline is not decorative -- it is the testable MVP for payment comprehension that the verbal explanation failed to achieve.",

His trust is 100% personal, 0% institutional. When he receives a follow-up email, his expectation is personal: 'They send it to me about email. Let me take a look on it' (07:10). The Lean UX principle of shared understanding requires that team and customer share a common mental model. But Robbie's shared understanding is with Bryant (a person), not with the platform (a product). The Lean UX MVP concept asks: what is the smallest thing we can build to bridge this gap? The current approach -- sending agreement documents from a system email -- is an untested hypothesis. If the email arrives from 'noreply@splitlease.com' with generic onboarding language, Robbie encounters an entity he has never heard of asking him to do things that do not reference the conversation he had with Bryant. This is the highest-risk information architecture failure in the host journey because it occurs at the single moment when human trust must transfer to digital trust.",

(2) Property confirmation: 'Your renovated large studio in East Village, $1,600/month' -- the details Robbie already confirmed. (3) Guest introduction: 'Ariel and Amber are ready to move forward' -- the names Robbie already heard. (4) Payment timeline (communicates-0902-001) embedded directly. (5) Document links: 'Here are the two agreements I mentioned -- the rental agreement and the supplemental agreement' with one-sentence plain-language descriptions. (6) Action: 'Take a look and let me know if you have questions -- Bryant.' The page is sent via email from Bryant's address, not a system address.

After a 7-minute verbal explanation, he cannot describe the documents he will receive. The Lean UX principle of shared understanding demands that team and customer share common knowledge, but this shared understanding was not achieved. The onboarding documents are the second attempt to build it. If the documents are standard legal agreements -- dense text, formal language, multi-page -- they will fail for the same reason the call failed: they assume comprehension that does not exist. Robbie is a non-native English speaker who will read these documents alone, without Bryant available to clarify. Each unfamiliar term ('supplemental agreement,' 'pre-authorized charges') is a comprehension barrier that may not be overcome without help. The Lean UX framework treats the documents as an MVP: 'We believe that sending standard agreement documents will enable hosts to understand and accept the Split Lease model. We will know we're right when hosts sign without requesting additional explanation.' For hosts like Robbie, this hypothesis is high-risk.",

Your first payment of $1,600 arrives one day after Ariel and Amber move in.' Question 2: 'Who pays?' Answer: 'Ariel and Amber pay Split Lease. Split Lease pays you. You never collect rent directly.' Question 3: 'What if they miss a payment?' Answer: 'You still get paid. Split Lease guarantees your rent even if a guest misses their payment.' Below the three answers, the summary identifies the two documents: 'You will sign two agreements: (1) The Rental Agreement -- the contract between you and your guests about living in the apartment. (2) The Supplemental Agreement -- the contract between you and Split Lease that guarantees your payment.' Each document name is followed by one sentence in plain language, not a legal description. The summary is the comprehension MVP; the full agreements are the compliance artifacts. Test: call hosts 48 hours after sending the summary and ask 'When does your first payment arrive?'

If only photos and a price exist (as in Robbie's case), create a draft with photos, the address from the call, and the rent amount. (3) Present draft for verification: 'We put together a draft listing from what you shared. Please review and correct anything that needs updating.' Verification is cognitively cheaper than creation -- the host reads and confirms rather than generating from memory. (4) Translate pricing automatically: 'You said $1,600/month. Based on [lease style], guests would pay approximately $[X] per night.' The host sees both formats without performing any calculation. (5) Test the hypothesis: 'Import-path hosts will complete listing creation 40% faster than wizard-path hosts. We will know when we measure median completion time for each path.'",

      "problem": "Robbie's pricing mental model is fixed: '$1,600 a month' (02:22). He states it as a fact. The Split Lease platform operates on per-night pricing for nights-of-the-week lease styles. Translating $1,600/month to a nightly rate is non-trivial math ($1,600 / 30 nights = ~$53/night, but actual calculation depends on lease style and nights per week). Bryant reinforced the monthly anchor: '$1,600 would be released to you after that first night' (05:03-05:37). Any pricing display that shows only a nightly rate without connecting it to $1,600/month will create a perceived discrepancy. The Lean UX framework distinguishes between output ('host sets a nightly rate') and outcome ('host is confident they will receive $1,600/month'). The pricing interface must achieve the outcome, not just produce the output. If Robbie sees '$53/night' without understanding that it equals '$1,600/month,' he will either reject the pricing as wrong or accept it without understanding, leading to a support call when the first payment does not match his expectation.",
      "solution": "Accept monthly rent as the primary input and calculate the nightly rate automatically. The information architecture always shows both formats, with the monthly figure as the primary display and the nightly rate as the derived secondary. (1) Input: 'What is your monthly rent? $1,600' -- one field, the host's native format. (2) Calculation: the platform computes the nightly rate based on the lease style and displays it: '$1,600/month = approximately $53/night.' (3) Fee disclosure: if Split Lease takes a fee, show net income immediately: 'After Split Lease's service fee, you receive $[X]/month.' Never let the host discover fees through arithmetic. (4) Proposal display: 'This 3-month lease with Ariel and Amber will earn you $4,800 total ($1,600/month x 3 months).' (5) Active lease display: 'Next payment: $1,600 -- scheduled for [date].'

This is not a feature request; it is an emotional state he requires. The Lean UX principle 'Progress = Outcomes, Not Output' distinguishes between the feature (payment processing) and the goal (host confidence). The platform currently processes payments -- that is the output. But it does not proactively assure the host that payments are coming, arriving, and continuing -- that is the outcome Robbie needs. Bryant's verbal guarantee (06:52: 'even in the case that Ariel or Amber would miss a payment, you're still getting payment') was stated once during the call. During a 6-month lease, the host needs to feel this guarantee every month, not remember it from one phone call. If Robbie has to check the Leases page to learn his payment status, the information architecture has failed. Checking is anxiety; notification is assurance. The platform must move from reactive (host checks) to proactive (platform notifies) to achieve the confidence outcome.",

(1) Pre-notification (48 hours before payment): 'Your $1,600 payment for [month] is scheduled for release on [date].' This sets the expectation before the event. (2) Day-of confirmation (within 1 hour of processing): 'Your $1,600 payment has been released. You should see it in your account within [X] business days.' This confirms the event. (3) Next-payment preview (immediately after confirmation): 'Your next payment of $1,600 is scheduled for [next date].' This closes the loop and opens the next cycle. Each notification includes the guarantee badge: 'Guaranteed by Split Lease.' The three-part loop means the host is never in a state of 'wondering if payment is coming' for more than 48 hours. At proposal acceptance, show the full payment calendar for the lease: 'Payment 1: $1,600 on [date]. Payment 2: $1,600 on [date]...' This transforms acceptance from 'agreeing to hold the property' into 'seeing when every payment arrives.' At retention, show lifetime earnings: 'Over [X] months, you earned $[total] -- guaranteed by Split Lease.' Measure the outcome: track how often hosts check the Leases page for payment status, how often they contact support about payments.

The platform's unacknowledged assumption is that all hosts are fluent in English. Robbie invalidates this.

(2) Visual communication alongside every financial concept: timelines for payment flow, side-by-side numbers for pricing, checkmarks for completed steps. Visual information crosses language barriers that text cannot. (3) Consistent terminology: never alternate between synonyms. If the call said 'rental agreement,' the platform says 'rental agreement' -- not 'lease contract' or 'tenancy document.' If the call said 'guests,' the platform says 'guests' -- not 'tenants' or 'residents.' (4) No idioms or colloquialisms: 'your payment is on its way' becomes 'your $1,600 was sent today.'

  "methodology_notes": "Seven information architecture elements extracted from the intersection of Robbie's call behavior patterns and Gothelf's Lean UX hypothesis-driven design framework. Each element specifies HOW information should be structured (hierarchy), WHEN it should be revealed (disclosure), HOW MUCH the host can process (cognitive load), and WHAT THE EYE HITS FIRST (scan order). The Lean UX lens transforms each element into a testable hypothesis with explicit success criteria and market feedback signals. Elements are ordered from the most critical comprehension failure (communicates-0902-001: payment timeline -- the single issue Robbie raised three times) through the trust bridge (002), document comprehension (003), listing efficiency (004), pricing translation (005), active lease confidence (006), and the cross-cutting language multiplier (007). Every element traces to observable behavior in the Robbie call and to specific Lean UX principles. No element specifies visual design, layout, or interaction patterns -- those belong to subsequent layers."
