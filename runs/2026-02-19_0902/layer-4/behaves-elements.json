      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "pricing", "proposal_mgmt", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "The L3 visual pattern (looks-0902-001) defines a four-node payment timeline (Agreements Signed > Guest Moves In > First Night Completed > Your $1,600 Released), but without interaction behavior, the timeline is a static diagram. Robbie's comprehension failure during the call (three re-asks at 03:17, 04:06, 06:14) was not caused by absence of information -- Bryant explained the flow three times. It was caused by the absence of experiential confirmation: Robbie could not feel the sequence because he could only hear it. A static diagram improves on verbal explanation but still requires the host to mentally simulate 'what happens next.' The Lean UX principle of making over analysis demands that we build a timeline that the host experiences progressively -- each node activates as the real event occurs, converting the diagram from a promise into a record. The hypothesis: 'We believe a timeline that progressively activates based on real lease events will reduce payment re-asks by 60%. We will know when we compare support contact rates before and after deployment.'",
      "solution": "The payment timeline is not a static component -- it is a state machine that reflects the host's actual lease progress. (1) On the post-call landing page (onboarding), all four nodes are visible but only the first node ('Agreements Signed') is interactive. Tapping it reveals: 'Sign the rental agreement and supplemental agreement to get started.' The other three nodes are grayed (--text-gray, opacity 0.5) with labels visible but non-interactive. (2) When the host signs the agreements, the first node transitions to a completed state: fill changes from --border-color stroke to --secondary-purple fill with a 300ms ease-out animation, the pen icon inverts to white, and a subtle checkmark badge appears at the node's bottom-right. Simultaneously, the second node ('Guest Moves In') activates: it gains full opacity and becomes tappable. (3) When the guest checks in, the second node completes identically, and the third node ('First Night Completed') activates. (4) After the first night, the third node completes and the fourth node ('Your $1,600 Released') activates with the enlarged glow treatment from L3. (5) When payment is released, the final node completes with a celebratory pulse animation (scale 1.0 to 1.08 to 1.0 over 400ms, ease-out) and the dollar amount briefly flashes --secondary-purple before settling to --primary-purple. The entire timeline now shows four completed nodes -- a visual record that the promise was fulfilled. (6) For month 2 and beyond, the timeline resets nodes 2-4 to inactive state, maintaining node 1 as permanently completed. This monthly cycle means the host sees the timeline fulfill itself repeatedly, building cumulative confidence.",

      "problem": "Robbie's trust is 100% in Bryant, 0% in the platform. The L3 visual treatment (looks-0902-002) places Bryant's face and name before the brand, but the interaction design must ensure the host never encounters a registration wall, a login screen, or an unfamiliar form before seeing Bryant's name and their property details. The Lean UX MVP concept asks: what is the smallest interaction that tests whether personal recognition drives engagement? The current flow likely requires the host to create an account before seeing anything personalized. This inverts the trust sequence: Robbie must trust an unknown system before the system shows it knows who he is. The interaction must invert this: the system shows it knows Robbie before asking Robbie to trust it. Every additional tap, field, or screen between email click and Bryant's face increases the dropout probability. Robbie said 'just send it to me and let me see' (07:10) -- he expects to see, not to authenticate.",

(2) The landing page loads with Bryant's avatar and greeting visible within the first 500ms -- no splash screen, no loading gate, no cookie consent overlay blocking content. (3) The host scrolls through personalized content (property details, guest names, payment timeline, document links) freely, with no interaction required. This is the 'look' phase that Robbie requested. (4) At the bottom of the page, after all content has been consumed, a soft registration prompt appears: 'Ready to move forward? Create your account to sign the agreements.' The prompt includes pre-filled fields (name from call, email from call) so the host sees their data already populated -- another trust signal. (5) If the host does not register on this visit, their viewing activity is logged (which sections they scrolled through, how long they spent on the payment timeline). The next follow-up from Bryant can reference this: 'I noticed you looked at the agreements -- any questions?' (6) The token URL expires after 30 days.

'Just send it to me and let me see' (07:10) is not rejection; it is a request for a lower-commitment path. The Lean UX framework demands testing the hypothesis that a single-path interface (6-step wizard, full proposal acceptance form) is the right approach. Robbie's deferral behavior suggests it is not. He wants to engage, but on simpler terms. The platform currently offers binary choices: complete the full flow or leave. There is no graceful retreat -- no 'just send it to me and let me see' equivalent in the digital interface. When a host stalls on a complex form (stops typing, scrolls back up, hovers on the back button), the platform has no response. The stall becomes an abandonment because the platform does not offer a simpler path. The Lean UX principle of permission to fail applies to the host, not just the team: the host should be permitted to partially engage without the platform treating it as failure.",
      "solution": "Implement hesitation detection and a retreat mechanism at every high-commitment interaction point. (1) DETECTION: Monitor for hesitation signals -- page idle for 45 seconds, cursor movement toward browser back button, rapid scroll to top without completing any fields, tab switch and return without action, or form field focus without typing for 20 seconds. These signals trigger the retreat state. (2) RETREAT OFFER: A simplified card slides up from the bottom of the viewport (300ms ease-out, translateY from 100% to 0). The card uses a warm, concessive tone: 'This is a lot to take in. How about we start with just the basics?' For onboarding documents: 'Just read the one-page summary first. The full agreements can wait.' For listing creation: 'Just share your address and monthly rent. We will build a draft from there.' For pricing: 'Tell us your monthly rent and we will calculate everything else.' For proposal management: 'Not ready to accept? Save it and come back when you have had time to think.' (3) ACCEPTANCE: If the host accepts the retreat, the complex form dims (opacity 0.4, 300ms) and the simplified card expands to full width with 2-3 fields maximum. The host completes the simpler version, and their partial progress is saved. (4) PERSISTENCE: The path back to the full version is always visible: a link 'Continue with the full version' appears at the bottom of the simplified card, styled as secondary text (--text-gray, --text-sm).

But the interaction behavior must ensure that the import-to-verification transition feels effortless and that verification is genuinely cheaper than creation. If the import produces a draft that requires extensive correction, the host will perceive it as 'the system got it wrong' rather than 'the system started for me.' The Lean UX principle of small batch size demands: accept the smallest viable input and produce the closest viable draft. The interaction must also handle the common case where the host's existing listing is dead (as Robbie's Craigslist link was) -- the fallback must be equally smooth.",
      "solution": "Design the import interaction as a three-phase flow: Input > Process > Verify. (1) INPUT PHASE: The import drop zone is the primary interaction on the listing creation page. Three input modes: paste a URL, upload photos (drag-and-drop or file picker), or paste text from an existing listing description. All three modes are visible simultaneously as tabs within the drop zone. The URL tab is default because it is the most common import source. When the host starts any input, the 'Or create from scratch' link dims further (opacity 0.3) to signal that the import path is active and the scratch path is a fallback. (2) PROCESS PHASE: After input, a progress animation plays inside the drop zone: the upload icon transforms into a spinning extraction indicator (rotating ring, 1.5 seconds per revolution, --secondary-purple). Text updates: 'Building your listing draft...' If URL is dead (like Robbie's Craigslist link), the system gracefully degrades: 'That link is no longer available. Upload your photos instead, and we will use the details from your call with Bryant.' This fallback uses call data (address, rent amount) as a secondary source. If photos are uploaded, the system extracts metadata (EXIF location if available) and displays them immediately in a thumbnail grid while processing. (3) VERIFY PHASE: The drop zone transitions to a full listing preview. Each populated field has a green checkmark (imported successfully) and a pencil edit icon. Each missing field has an amber highlight and 'Needed' label. The host taps any field to edit inline -- a text input expands within the field, replacing the preview text. Edit saves on blur (no save button required for individual fields). The monthly rent displays in dual format: '$1,600/month = ~$53/night.' A final 'Looks good -- publish draft' button at the bottom. (4) MEASURE: Track time-to-published-listing for import-path hosts versus wizard-path hosts.

The real-time update uses a 150ms debounce so the number does not flicker during typing.

This row appears as soon as the host types a number -- never deferred to a later screen. (4) On the proposal acceptance screen, the pricing display is read-only: '$1,600/month' in primary treatment with the total lease value below: 'This 3-month lease earns you $4,800.'

      "problem": "Robbie is a non-native English speaker whose comprehension difficulties are visible throughout the call: 'this me, where this have to be confirmed immediately' (04:06), 'The contract has been fueled' (06:14), 'how many, something of the agreement you're talking about' (07:10). The L3 visual system (looks-0902-007) defines an icon-primary design with consistent icon-concept pairing. But the interaction behavior must ensure that icons are not just decorative -- they must be the primary interactive affordances. If a host cannot read the button label, they should be able to complete the action by recognizing the icon. This means every interactive element must have an icon that communicates the action independently of the text. The Lean UX hypothesis: 'Non-native English speakers will achieve equivalent task completion rates when icons are the primary interactive affordance. We will know when completion rates are within 15 percentage points of native speaker rates.'",
      "solution": "Implement an icon-first interaction layer across all critical host flows. (1) Every button, link, and interactive element in a critical flow includes an icon to the left of the text label. The icon is 24px (--icon-md) and the label is maximum 2 words. Icon and label are both interactive (the entire row is a tap target). (2) Tooltips on icon hover (desktop) or long-press (mobile) provide a one-sentence explanation in simple language (maximum 8 words). Example: pen icon + 'Sign' button, tooltip: 'Sign the rental agreement.' (3) Critical multi-step flows use a visual progress tracker with icons for each step, not numbered steps. The listing wizard: upload icon (photos) > home icon (address) > dollar icon (price) > checkmark icon (publish). The host can identify what each step requires by the icon alone. (4) Error messages pair an icon with the error text. The red alert icon is used only for true errors. Amber warning icon for suggestions. Green checkmark for success. The icon communicates severity before the host reads the text. (5) Form labels include micro-icons: address field has a map pin icon, rent field has a dollar icon, photo upload has a camera icon. These icons provide redundant encoding -- the host can identify the field by icon or label. (6) The interaction system is testable: recruit 5 non-native English speakers and ask them to complete the listing flow by looking only at icons. If 4 of 5 can identify what each step requires, the icon system is effective. (7) Consistent icon-concept locking: once a host sees the dollar icon with 'payment,' the dollar icon always means payment across all screens. No icon is reused for different concepts.",

Each element specifies: (1) states -- the discrete configurations the component can occupy, including default, loading, success, error, and phase-specific variants; (2) transitions -- how the component moves between states, with easing curves mapped to emotional intent; (3) timing -- response targets for each interaction with rationale grounded in Robbie's behavioral patterns; (4) journey state awareness -- how the same component behaves differently across host phases; (5) edge cases -- scenarios where the standard interaction breaks and the recovery path. The Lean UX lens transforms each interaction into a testable hypothesis with measurable outcomes: payment re-ask rate for the timeline, click-to-register rate for the trust handoff, retreat acceptance rate for the hesitation detector, time-to-publish for the import flow, payment check frequency for the notification cycle, pricing surprise rate for the dual-format input, and icon recognition rate for the accessibility system. Every interaction pattern traces to observable behavior in Robbie's call and to specific Lean UX principles. No element specifies final HTML/CSS, animation library choice, or backend implementation -- those belong to subsequent layers."
