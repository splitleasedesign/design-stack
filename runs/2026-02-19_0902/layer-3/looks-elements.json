      "problem": "Robbie was told the payment flow three times during a 7-minute call (03:25, 05:03, 06:37) and reasserted his own contradictory model three times (03:17, 04:06, 06:14). Each verbal attempt used paragraph-form explanations that required Robbie -- a non-native English speaker -- to hold the full sequence in working memory while mapping it against his existing landlord mental model (contract signed = payment received immediately). The L2 information architecture defines a four-node timeline (Agreements Signed > Guest Moves In > First Night Completed > Your $1,600 Released), but no visual treatment has been specified. Without deliberate visual design, the four nodes risk rendering as a flat bullet list or a thin horizontal line with equal-weight labels -- neither of which achieves the sub-5-second comprehension target. The visual treatment must make the dollar amount at the endpoint the most visually dominant element on the timeline, because that is the anchor Robbie is scanning for. The nodes must use iconography that crosses the language barrier, and the directional flow must be unmistakable even to someone who cannot read the labels.",
      "solution": "Design the payment timeline as a horizontal stepper with four circular nodes connected by directional arrows, where the final node is visually dominant. (1) Node circles: 40px diameter, --border-color (#e5e7eb) stroke at 2px, --bg-white (#ffffff) fill for incomplete nodes, --secondary-purple (rgb(109, 49, 194)) fill for the active/completed node. Each node contains an icon at --icon-sm (20px): a pen icon (Agreements Signed), a door icon (Guest Moves In), a moon icon (First Night), and a dollar icon (Payment Released). Icons use --text-gray (#6b7280) when incomplete and --white when active. (2) Connecting arrows: 2px solid --border-color between nodes, with a small chevron (>) at each midpoint to enforce left-to-right directionality. (3) Node labels: below each circle, Inter at --text-sm (12px), --font-weight-medium (500), --text-gray for the first three nodes. Maximum 3 words per label. (4) Final node treatment: the fourth node is 56px diameter (1.4x larger), filled with --secondary-purple, with a soft glow shadow (0 0 12px rgba(109, 49, 194, 0.25)). The label below reads 'Your $1,600 Released' in Inter, --text-md (16px), --font-weight-bold (700), --primary-purple (#31135D). The dollar amount is the largest text on the entire timeline. (5) Below the timeline, a single confirmation sentence in DM Sans, --text-base (14px), --font-weight-normal (400), --text-description (#374151): 'You receive $1,600 after your guest's first night each month.' (6) Below the sentence, a guarantee badge: pill-shaped (--rounded-pill, 20px), --secondary-purple background, white text, Inter --text-xs (11px), --font-weight-semibold (600): 'Guaranteed by Split Lease.' (7) The full timeline component sits on a --bg-off-white (rgb(252, 250, 255)) card with --rounded-xl (12px), --spacing-2xl (24px) padding, and --shadow-purple-sm (0 2px 4px rgba(49, 19, 93, 0.2)). (8) Mobile adaptation: on screens below --breakpoint-sm (600px), the timeline rotates to vertical layout with nodes stacked top-to-bottom, connected by vertical lines.

When he receives a follow-up, he expects a personal message from Bryant, not a system notification from a brand he has never used. The L2 architecture defines the content hierarchy (agent greeting > property confirmation > guest names > payment timeline > documents), but the visual treatment must ensure that the agent's identity is unmistakable within the first viewport before any platform branding competes for attention. If the landing page looks like a marketing email -- logo-heavy header, purple gradient hero, generic CTA buttons -- Robbie will not recognize it as the follow-up Bryant promised. The visual challenge is to make a platform-generated page feel like a personal message. The Lean UX MVP concept applies: this is the smallest visual experiment to test whether personal attribution achieves higher click-through than brand attribution.",
      "solution": "Design the post-call landing page with agent identity as the primary visual element. (1) Header: no logo-heavy navigation bar. Instead, a minimal top strip with 'Split Lease' in Inter, --text-sm (12px), --text-gray (#6b7280), left-aligned -- the brand is present but whisper-quiet. (2) Hero section: left-aligned layout with Bryant's circular avatar photo (80px, --avatar-lg) with a warm shadow (0 4px 12px rgba(109, 49, 194, 0.15)) and a 2px border in --secondary-purple.

(5) Payment timeline (looks-0902-001) embedded as a full-width component below the guest card. (6) Document links: two rows, each with a document icon in --secondary-purple (--icon-md, 24px) and a document name in Inter, --text-base (14px), --font-weight-medium (500), --text-dark, with a one-sentence description in DM Sans, --text-sm (12px), --text-gray.

The L2 architecture defines an import-and-verify path that prioritizes verification over creation. But without deliberate visual treatment, the import path risks looking like a second form -- an upload zone followed by a blank wizard is still a wizard. The visual design must make the import experience feel like reviewing a near-complete draft, not filling out a form. The key visual distinction: populated fields with editable overlays (verification) versus empty fields with placeholder text (creation). For Robbie, who is cognitively depleted from a confusing evaluation call and processing a second language, the visual difference between 'confirm what we already know' and 'tell us everything from scratch' is the difference between completing the listing and abandoning it.",

This mental arithmetic is a System 2 task that a cognitively depleted, non-native English speaker processing unfamiliar financial structures will likely fail at. The L2 architecture defines a dual-format display with monthly as primary and nightly as secondary, but the visual treatment must ensure the size and weight differential between the two numbers is large enough that the host never mistakes the nightly rate for the primary figure. Furthermore, fees (if any) must be disclosed inline -- never discovered through arithmetic after the fact.",

      "problem": "Robbie is a non-native English speaker whose comprehension difficulties are visible throughout the call: 'this me, where this have to be confirmed immediately. You feel the contract phone to, uh, to, to hold any property for you out loss' (04:06), 'The contract has been fueled' (06:14), 'how many, something of the agreement you're talking about' (07:10). Every interface that relies on text as the primary communication channel will underperform for hosts like Robbie. The L2 architecture defines a maximum 8-word sentence rule and visual-alongside-financial-concept requirement. But the visual treatment must go further: it must establish a visual language where icons are the primary information carriers and text is the confirmation layer. If a non-native speaker can understand what to do on a screen by reading only the icons and numbers -- without reading any sentences -- the design has succeeded. This is the Lean UX hypothesis: 'We believe icon-primary interfaces will achieve equivalent task completion rates for non-native and native English speakers. We will know when completion rates are within 15 percentage points.'",
      "solution": "Establish a visual design system for critical host flows where icons carry primary meaning and text confirms. (1) Icon style: line icons at --icon-md (24px) in --secondary-purple (rgb(109, 49, 194)) for actionable items, --text-gray (#6b7280) for informational items. All icons from a single consistent set (recommend Phosphor or Lucide for their clarity at small sizes). Each critical concept has one dedicated icon used consistently across all screens: pen icon = sign/agreement, dollar icon = payment/money, calendar icon = dates/schedule, door icon = move-in, checkmark icon = confirmed/complete, upload icon = import/add content, document icon = agreement/PDF. (2) Icon-text pairing rule: every critical action or concept appears as icon (24px) + short label (maximum 8 words, Inter, --text-base (14px), --font-weight-medium (500), --text-dark). The icon and label are horizontally aligned with --spacing-sm (8px) gap. The icon is always left, the label always right. This left-to-right icon-text pattern becomes a visual grammar the host learns once and recognizes across all screens. (3) Number prominence: all dollar amounts and dates use DM Sans, --font-weight-bold (700), --primary-purple (#31135D), regardless of the surrounding text size. This ensures that even during a quick skim, the host resolves the financial and temporal information first. (4) Action buttons: always include an icon alongside the label. 'Sign' button = pen icon + 'Sign.' 'Accept' button = checkmark icon + 'Accept.' 'Next' button = arrow icon + 'Next.' Button text maximum 2 words, Inter, --text-md (16px), --font-weight-semibold (600), white on --gradient-purple-button. (5) No multi-clause sentences in critical flows. Replace 'After the first night of the booking, upon confirmation that the guest has checked in, your payment will be released' with icon (moon) + 'First night done' and icon (dollar) + 'Payment released.' Two icon-text pairs replace one complex sentence. (6) Terminology lock: 'guests' (never 'tenants'), 'rental agreement' (never 'lease contract'), 'payment' (never 'disbursement'). Visual terminology consistency reinforced by consistent icon pairing -- the pen icon always appears with 'agreement,' the dollar icon always appears with 'payment.'",
