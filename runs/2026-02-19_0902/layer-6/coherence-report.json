The arc is not a smooth curve -- it has two potential break points: (1) onboarding, where the plain-language summary must succeed where the call failed, and (2) proposal management, where the payment calendar must convert 'I need payment immediately' into 'I can see exactly when every payment arrives.' If both break points are navigated successfully, the active lease and retention phases benefit from compounding certainty. The Lean UX lens adds a meta-layer to this arc: every emotional state is a measurable outcome, not just a feeling to aspire to. Payment anxiety is measured by check frequency and support contacts.

Discovery itself is passive for agent-acquired hosts like Robbie -- the agent finds them, not the other way around. Coverage is appropriate for this acquisition path but does not address organic/self-service discovery."
    },
    "evaluation": {
      "element_count": 18,
      "coverage": "strong",
      "note": "The evaluation phase is the most heavily covered because Robbie's call IS the evaluation phase. Payment timeline, trust handoff, plain-language summary, language accessibility, and payment certainty emotion all converge here. This is the phase where the Lean UX hypothesis-testing framework applies most directly."
    },
    "onboarding": {
      "element_count": 21,
      "coverage": "strong",
      "note": "Onboarding is the critical bridging phase between the call and the platform. Covered by the personalized landing page, plain-language summary, payment timeline, import-and-verify path, hesitation retreat, language accessibility, and multiple emotional elements. This density is appropriate: onboarding is where the most dropout risk exists for Robbie's profile."
    },
    "listing_creation": {
      "element_count": 18,
      "coverage": "strong",
      "note": "The import-and-verify listing path, dual-format pricing, hesitation retreat, and language accessibility provide comprehensive coverage. The Lean UX waste-removal principle is the dominant theme: accept existing work, do not demand re-creation."
    },
    "pricing": {
      "element_count": 16,
      "coverage": "strong",
      "note": "Pricing coverage is dense because the monthly-to-nightly translation problem is one of the strongest cross-run patterns in the library. This run adds the Lean UX outcome framing (confidence in monthly income, not nightly rate field completion) and the emotional dimension (pricing as threatening when the anchor is not visible)."
    },
    "proposal_mgmt": {
      "element_count": 17,
      "coverage": "strong",
      "note": "Proposal management is the second critical break point. Covered by the payment timeline, payment calendar at acceptance, dual-format pricing, proactive notification setup, hesitation retreat, and payment certainty emotion. The core tension (Robbie wants immediate payment, platform provides delayed payment) is addressed but not fully resolved -- this remains the highest-risk phase."
    },
    "active_lease": {
      "element_count": 12,
      "coverage": "moderate",
      "note": "Active lease coverage focuses on the proactive payment notification cycle, the progressive payment timeline, and dual-format pricing on the Leases page. Less breadth than evaluation/onboarding, but the elements present are highly targeted at Robbie's core need (payment certainty). Gap: no elements address non-payment active lease concerns (guest communication, property maintenance, date changes)."
    },
    "retention": {
      "element_count": 5,
      "coverage": "thin",
      "note": "Retention covered by the proactive notification cycle (lifetime earnings summary), the payment certainty emotion (cumulative promise fulfillment), and the retention prompt timing. Thin because this run's lens (Robbie's call) does not reach the retention phase -- all retention elements are projections from call behavior. The existing ds-ui-0900-007 (Cumulative Gift Ledger) provides additional coverage from a different theoretical framework."

      "reason": "The L1 elements (works) do not include a specific element for the monthly reset cycle in the payment timeline. behaves-0902-001 introduces a monthly reset where nodes 2-4 return to inactive, but no L1 process pattern governs how the platform handles recurring monthly cycles vs. one-time flows. The payment timeline's monthly behavior should be grounded in a L1 principle about cyclical trust-building processes.",
      "new_input": "Lean UX's continuous discovery principle applied to monthly payment cycles: each month is a new experiment run where the hypothesis 'proactive notification will preempt payment anxiety' is re-tested. The reset is not a loss of progress -- it is the beginning of a new measurement cycle."

    {
      "layer": "2",
      "reason": "communicates-0902-003 (plain-language summary) specifies a Q&A format with three questions. But the three questions are derived from Robbie's specific call. Other hosts may have different questions (e.g., 'How long is the lease?' 'Can I choose my guests?'). The L2 information architecture should define a methodology for identifying the host's top 3 questions, not hard-code Robbie's three.",
      "new_input": "Lean UX's proto-persona methodology: create a 'traditional landlord' proto-persona whose top questions are payment timing, guest identity, and loss protection. Test this persona against the next 5 host calls. If 3+ hosts ask the same three questions, the Q&A is validated. If different questions emerge, iterate the summary."

This is not in the existing token system and may conflict with the production signal-warn palette. The visual treatment should be reviewed for consistency with existing warning patterns across the library.",
      "new_input": "The field-needs-attention state is semantically different from a warning (signal-warn). A warning says 'something is wrong.' The needs-attention state says 'something is incomplete.' Consider a distinct token (--field-incomplete-bg) using a purple tint (rgba(109, 49, 194, 0.05)) instead of amber, to differentiate incompleteness from warning within the purple design system."

      "reason": "feels-0902-006 (comprehension through simplicity) identifies language as an emotional inclusion barrier but does not specify how to detect whether a host is a non-native speaker without asking them directly. The emotional element should include a detection heuristic (browser language settings, typing speed patterns, call transcript analysis) so the platform can proactively offer simplified language rather than waiting for the host to struggle.",
      "new_input": "Lean UX's GOOB principle: rather than building detection heuristics, test the plain-language version as the default for ALL hosts. If native speakers do not find it patronizing (measure via satisfaction survey), the simplified version becomes the production default and no detection is needed. The hypothesis: 'plain language is better for everyone, not just non-native speakers.'"
