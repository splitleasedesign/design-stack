    "lens_summary": "Kahneman's Two Selves framework (Part V of Thinking, Fast and Slow) reveals that the guest's decision to rebook on Split Lease is governed not by the totality of their lived experience during the lease, but by the remembering self's distorted summary of it. The peak-end rule means the most intense moment (positive or negative) and the final moment of the stay disproportionately determine the guest's retrospective evaluation. Duration neglect means a 16-week lease is remembered no differently than a 4-week lease -- only the peaks and the ending matter. The focusing illusion means that whatever the guest is attending to at the moment of evaluation (move-in shock, a dispute, a beautiful space) will loom larger than it deserves. Together, these principles reveal that Split Lease's retention problem is not about the average quality of the experience but about the architecture of memorable moments -- particularly move-in (first peak) and the final days of the lease (the end that defines the memory)."

Kahneman Ch 36 establishes that 'a story is about significant events and memorable moments, not about time passing' -- the guest in discovery is not conducting a systematic evaluation but collecting fragments that will form a story about whether this platform is worth trusting. The user stories analysis confirms: 'Value before the ask -- always. Any flow that requires users to give information before seeing results will lose most of them.' This is a focusing illusion problem: whatever the guest encounters first in discovery will loom disproportionately large in their evaluation of the platform. If the first impression is a cluttered landing page or a demand for personal information, that becomes the 'peak' of the discovery experience -- and the peak-end rule ensures it defines the entire remembered impression. Conversely, if the first impression is a beautiful listing card with a photo carousel (user stories: 'each listing card to show a photo carousel with navigation arrows'), the positive peak anchors the nascent narrative. The existing library addresses trust gates and first impressions, but the Two Selves lens adds a specific mechanism: discovery is not about what the guest learns, it is about what memorable fragment the remembering self captures and stores as representative of the entire platform.",

The guest who spends 45 minutes searching and finds one stunning listing will remember only the stunning listing. The guest who spends 45 minutes and encounters frustration (bad filters, irrelevant results, confusing UI) will remember only the frustration. Duration neglect means the length of the search session is irrelevant to the remembered experience -- only the peak (best or worst listing encountered) and the end (what they saw last) matter. The user stories analysis identifies specific mechanisms for creating positive peaks during search: 'each listing card to show a photo carousel with navigation arrows so that I preview multiple images without leaving search results' and 'the map to show transit stops, landmarks, and points of interest.' These are peak-manufacturing features: they increase the probability that the guest encounters a vivid, positive moment that the remembering self will store.

The guest is moment-to-moment evaluating photos, price, rules, host info, and neighborhood -- the experiencing self is engaged. But the remembering self is already composing a story about this listing, and that story will be governed by the peak-end rule. Kahneman Ch 36: 'A story is about significant events and memorable moments, not about time passing.' The guest will not remember every photo or every rule; they will remember the most striking photo and the last piece of information they read before deciding. The user stories analysis identifies a critical mechanism: 'Messaging before proposals is a natural step. The park analogy holds -- you check availability before committing.' This is a Two Selves insight: the guest's experiencing self wants more information, but the remembering self needs a narrative bridge between 'I'm interested' and 'I'm committing.' Messaging creates a memorable interaction peak -- a human moment (asking the host a question) that the remembering self stores as evidence of connection and safety. Without it, the narrative jumps from 'I liked the photos' to 'I submitted a proposal,' which feels like a gap in the story. The focusing illusion also operates here: whatever the guest is attending to on the listing page becomes disproportionately important. If price is prominent, the guest evaluates the listing through a price lens. If photos are prominent, the evaluation shifts. The user stories note 'Verified reviews and host credibility signals activate guests' -- these are focusing mechanisms that direct attention to trust rather than price.",

Kahneman Ch 38 introduces 'miswanting' (Daniel Gilbert's term): 'bad choices that arise from errors of affective forecasting.' The guest creating a proposal is susceptible to the focusing illusion: they are currently focused on the listing's best features (the photos, the location, the price) and will overweight these in predicting their future happiness. They are not thinking about the mundane reality of living there week after week -- duration neglect means they literally cannot imagine what 16 weeks will feel like differently from 4 weeks. The user stories analysis identifies that 'the proposal itself is a cross-activation event' and that structured, pre-populated proposals work better than blank forms. The Two Selves lens explains why: a pre-populated proposal gives the remembering self a coherent narrative of what was proposed, while a blank form forces the guest to construct the narrative themselves, increasing the risk of miswanting (choosing terms that sound good but will not produce good experiences). The journey map shows the guest configures duration, days per week, and sees calculated pricing. Each of these is an affective forecast: the guest imagines 16 weeks of Tuesday-Thursday stays and predicts satisfaction. But Kahneman warns that this prediction is driven by the focusing illusion -- the guest is thinking about the arrangement now, and 'nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.'",

Similarly, a guest creating a proposal is experiencing elevated satisfaction that will not persist at this intensity through the actual lease.",

The host counter-proposes (the journey map shows the host changing duration from 16 weeks to 10 weeks), and the guest must re-evaluate. Kahneman's prospect theory (referenced in Ch 35) shows that losses loom larger than gains -- a counter-proposal that reduces duration feels like a loss, even if 10 weeks at a better price is objectively favorable. The remembering self stores this as either 'we worked it out' (positive narrative) or 'they didn't want me on my terms' (negative narrative). The peak of the negotiation -- whether positive or negative -- will be stored disproportionately. The user stories analysis identifies that messaging is 'the highest cross-activation story in the list' because 'that's not just UX convenience -- it's the moment two strangers begin to trust each other through the platform.' The Two Selves lens adds: messaging during negotiation creates a human peak that can override the negative affect of a counter-proposal. If the host's counter comes with a warm message ('I'd love to have you, but 10 weeks works better for my schedule'), the remembering self stores the warmth, not the rejection. If the counter arrives as a cold, system-generated notification, the remembering self stores only the loss. Duration neglect applies to the negotiation timeline: whether the back-and-forth takes 2 hours or 2 days does not affect the remembered experience -- only the peak moment and the resolution (end) matter.",

Acceptance is the climax of the guest's booking narrative: the moment the story resolves. If this moment is anticlimactic (a dry confirmation screen, a transactional 'your proposal has been accepted'), the remembering self stores a flat endpoint rather than a peak. The journey map shows: 'The Guest clicks Accept Host Terms. A confirmation dialog appears: Yes, Proceed. After confirming, the proposal status updates to reflect mutual agreement.' This is purely transactional -- the experiencing self registers mild satisfaction, and the remembering self stores... almost nothing. The user stories analysis does not specifically address the acceptance moment, which is itself a signal: the acceptance experience has not been designed as a memorable peak. The Two Selves lens reveals this as a critical missed opportunity. Kahneman's vacation studies (Ch 36) show that 'the intentions for future vacations were entirely determined by the final evaluation -- even when that score did not accurately represent the quality of the experience described in the diaries.' Acceptance is the 'final evaluation' of the pre-lease journey. If it ends with a positive peak (celebration, human warmth, anticipation-building), the guest enters move-in with a positive narrative.

      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Move-in is the single most consequential moment in the entire guest journey from the remembering self's perspective. This is where the peak-end rule collides with the focusing illusion at maximum force. Kahneman Ch 35: 'The global retrospective rating was well predicted by the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and at its end.' Move-in is almost certainly the peak -- either the highest positive peak (the space is better than expected, the host is warm, the key handoff is smooth) or the highest negative peak (the space does not match the photos, something is broken, the host is absent). Whichever it is, this moment will define the guest's memory of the entire lease. The journey map describes move-in as: 'First impressions, key handoff, settling in. Guest accesses House Manual for rules, guidelines, and check-in procedures. Reality vs. listing expectations.' The phrase 'reality vs. listing expectations' is precisely the gap between affective forecasting and experienced utility that Kahneman identifies. The guest's proposal was an affective forecast; move-in is when experienced utility begins. The user stories analysis does not specifically address move-in, which is a critical gap. The Two Selves lens reveals that move-in design should be treated as the most important moment in the entire guest journey -- more important than search, more important than the listing page, more important than pricing. Because the remembering self weights peaks and ends above all else, and move-in is the first (and often highest) peak of the actual lease experience, it has disproportionate power to determine whether the guest rebooks. Kahneman Ch 38 on adaptation: 'Adaptation to a new situation, whether good or bad, consists in large part of thinking less and less about it.' After move-in, the guest will adapt -- the experiencing self will settle into routine. But the remembering self captured the move-in moment and will use it as the reference point for the entire lease narrative.",

      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Active lease is the domain of the experiencing self -- the guest is living moment-to-moment, and Kahneman's research shows that moment-to-moment well-being is determined by 'the current situation' (Ch 37): social contact, noise, stress, engagement. But the Two Selves framework reveals a fundamental tension: the experiencing self's daily well-being during the lease has almost no effect on whether the guest rebooks. The remembering self, which makes the rebooking decision, cares only about peaks and the end. This means the platform faces a paradox: it should optimize the experiencing self's daily well-being (because suffering is real) while simultaneously engineering memorable peaks and a positive ending (because these determine retention). The journey map details the daily mechanisms: Stays Manager, date changes, arrival notifications, cleaning photos, reviews, House Manual, messaging. These are experiencing-self features -- they make the daily reality better. But from the remembering self's perspective, they are invisible unless something goes wrong (creating a negative peak) or goes exceptionally right (creating a positive peak). Kahneman Ch 37: 'happiness is the experience of spending time with people you love and who love you.' The guest's daily experienced well-being is determined not by the platform but by their real-world situation -- their job, their relationships, their health. The space is merely the container. The platform's greatest leverage during active lease is not daily UX but the architecture of the ending. Kahneman Ch 35 on the colonoscopy study: 'gradual relief may be preferable to abrupt relief.' The lease should not end abruptly. The final days, the final stay, the final review -- these constitute the 'end' of the peak-end rule and must be designed with the same care as move-in. CRITICAL: The guest journey has no formal 'post_stay' or 'retention' phase. The end of active_lease IS the end of the experience. The remembering self's final impression of Split Lease is formed in the last days of the last stay. If the lease ends with administrative friction (unclear checkout, disputed cleaning, delayed deposit return), that becomes the END that the peak-end rule weights so heavily. If it ends with warmth (a host thank-you message, a smooth review exchange, a clear and positive offboarding), that positive end can override weeks of mediocre experiencing-self data.",

The experiencing self may be perfectly content, but the remembering self has nothing new to store -- until something goes wrong (negative peak) or the lease ends (the end). Late in the lease, as the end approaches, the emotional state shifts to anticipatory: the guest is thinking about what comes next, and this reflection activates the remembering self.
