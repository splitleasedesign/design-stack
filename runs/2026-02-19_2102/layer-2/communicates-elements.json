      "journey_phases": ["acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "The move-in moment is the highest-peak-probability event in the entire guest journey. Kahneman Ch 38 warns: 'Adaptation to a new situation consists in large part of thinking less and less about it.' Within days, the guest will stop noticing the space. Move-in is the only moment when every detail is attended to at full intensity. The information architecture challenge is: what information does the guest encounter first upon arrival, and in what order? Currently, the guest accesses the House Manual for rules, guidelines, and check-in procedures. This is administratively correct but emotionally wrong. Leading with rules and procedures at the peak-sensitivity moment means the guest's first attended-to information is constraint-oriented ('here are the rules') rather than welcome-oriented ('here is what makes this space special'). The focusing illusion (Ch 38: 'any aspect of life to which attention is directed will loom large in a global evaluation') means whatever the guest reads first at move-in will define the space in memory. If the first information is 'no shoes indoors,' the space is remembered as restrictive. If the first information is 'the morning light in the living room is beautiful -- the host recommends coffee by the window,' the space is remembered as warm.",
      "solution": "Restructure the move-in information hierarchy so that welcome content precedes operational content. The scan order for the guest's first 24 hours should be: (1) Host welcome message: a personal note from the host, surfaced as the first element of the move-in dashboard card. This is the human peak -- the guest reads a message written specifically for them. (2) Neighborhood essentials: three curated items (closest coffee shop, nearest grocery, transit instructions) that signal 'you belong here now.' These are experiencing-self essentials that predict daily well-being and immediately answer the guest's first practical questions. (3) Space highlights: 2-3 features the host has flagged as the best parts of the space ('the rooftop has a great sunset view,' 'the shower pressure is excellent'). These direct the guest's focusing illusion toward positive features, increasing the probability of a positive first impression. (4) House rules and procedures: access codes, quiet hours, trash schedule, check-in/check-out times. These appear below the fold, accessible but not leading. The guest who needs them can find them; the guest who is absorbing the space is not confronted with constraints first. The information architecture follows the principle from the user stories: 'Value before the ask -- always.' Welcome, neighborhood, and highlights are value. Rules and procedures are the ask.",

      "problem": "The peak-end rule means the ending of the lease is one of only two data points the remembering self stores. Yet the platform's information architecture at lease end is purely administrative: final stay dates, cleaning submission, review prompt, deposit processing. There is no narrative information architecture -- no structure that helps the guest compose a positive ending to their lease story. Kahneman Ch 36: 'A story is about significant events and memorable moments, not about time passing. Duration neglect is normal in a story, and the ending often defines its character.' The guest's lease is a story, and the ending defines its character. If the ending's information architecture is administrative (invoices, reviews, deposit notices), the story ends administratively. If the ending's information architecture is narrative (lease summary, host closing message, neighborhood farewell, rebooking invitation), the story ends warmly. The user stories analysis does not address lease-end information architecture, which is itself a gap that the Two Selves lens identifies as critical. Kahneman Ch 36's vacation study showed that 'the intentions for future vacations were entirely determined by the final evaluation.' The lease-end information architecture IS the final evaluation's raw material.",
      "solution": "Create a dedicated lease-end information surface that serves the remembering self's need for narrative closure. This surface appears 7 days before the final stay and evolves through three information states: (1) Reflection state (7 days before final stay): a 'Lease Summary' card surfaces on the guest's dashboard showing the lease narrative in scannable form -- total stays completed, duration, neighborhood, host name. A reflective prompt invites the guest to save a memory: 'What will you remember most about this space?' This is not a survey; it is a narrative prompt that activates the remembering self to compose a positive story. (2) Farewell state (during final stay): the card updates to include the host's closing message (prompted from the host 48 hours before). The host's message is the human information element that converts the ending from administrative to relational. Below the message, the 3 neighborhood essentials from move-in are re-surfaced with a farewell frame: 'Your spots in [neighborhood]' -- a narrative bookend that connects the ending to the beginning. (3) Gratitude state (24 hours after final departure): the card transforms into a full lease narrative: dates, stays, host name, the guest's own memory prompt response, the host's closing message, and a rebooking prompt. This is the final information architecture the guest encounters. If designed well, it is the information the remembering self stores as the ending of the lease story.",

      "journey_phases": ["search", "listing_evaluation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 35 establishes that the remembering self 'represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes, not by sums.' A search session will be represented by one prototypical listing card impression. The information architecture of the listing card determines the quality of this prototype. The user stories analysis identifies that listing cards are 'leaving engagement on the table' and prescribes 'richer hover states, image counters, availability indicators, neighborhood labels, and quick actions.' The Two Selves lens adds a specific mechanism: each information element on the card is a peak probability multiplier. A card with only a photo and price provides two peak opportunities (a striking photo or a surprisingly good price). A card with a photo carousel, neighborhood label, transit indicator, availability signal, and host response time provides six peak opportunities. Since the remembering self stores only the best moment from the search session, maximizing peak probability per card maximizes the probability of a positive search memory. The focusing illusion (Ch 38) adds a second layer: whatever information is most prominent on the card becomes the lens through which the guest evaluates the listing. If price is prominent, the guest evaluates through a price lens. If neighborhood context is prominent, the guest evaluates through an experiential lens. The experiential lens produces richer memories that support rebooking.",
      "solution": "Design the listing card information hierarchy to maximize peak probability and bias the focusing illusion toward experiential qualities. (1) Primary zone (first impression, under 1 second): photo carousel (auto-advancing on hover) with image counter. The photo is the strongest peak generator -- multiple photos multiply the chance. (2) Secondary zone (immediate context, 1-3 seconds): neighborhood label with transit indicator ('Williamsburg -- 3 min to L train'). This creates the experiential identity of the listing. The guest does not remember '450/week'; they remember 'the Williamsburg place near the L.' (3) Tertiary zone (decision signals, 3-5 seconds): availability alignment ('Available your dates'), host response speed indicator ('Responds in ~2 hours'), and a quick-action button set (Save / Message / View). Availability alignment is a peak moment -- it resolves the fundamental question without requiring a click. (4) Quaternary zone (reference data): price, lease duration range, rating score. These are necessary but should not lead. The focusing illusion dictates that whatever leads defines the evaluation lens. Photos and neighborhood should lead; price should support.",

Kahneman Ch 38 warns that this forecast is governed by the focusing illusion: 'Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.' The guest evaluating a listing is thinking about whatever the page shows them most prominently. If photos dominate, they forecast based on visual impression. If price dominates, they forecast based on financial calculation. Neither accurately predicts experienced well-being during the lease. Kahneman Ch 37 shows that experienced well-being is determined by 'the current situation' -- social contact, noise, stress, engagement. The listing page currently provides remembering-self information (beautiful photos, compelling descriptions) but limited experiencing-self information (what is the commute like? how noisy is the street? what is the kitchen actually like for daily cooking?). The user stories identify that 'Verified reviews and host credibility signals activate guests' and 'the map should show transit stops, landmarks, and points of interest.' These are experiencing-self data sources -- they describe what daily life will actually be like. But their current information architecture position (reviews below the fold, map as a separate component) means they are processed after the focusing illusion has already anchored on photos.",

Position this as the first non-photo information element. (2) Neighborhood daily essentials: closest grocery, coffee, laundromat, gym -- the infrastructure of daily experienced well-being. Present as a compact list with walking times, not just names. (3) Review highlights: extract the most frequently mentioned experiential qualities from reviews (quietness, natural light, kitchen quality, host responsiveness) and present them as tags or short excerpts. The user stories note that 'every review is a past guest activating a future one.' Position review highlights in the first scroll to ensure they participate in the initial focusing illusion alongside photos. (4) Livability signals: noise level indicator (quiet street / moderate / busy), natural light indicator, workspace suitability. These are proxy measures for experiencing-self data that the platform can generate or collect from hosts. The key information architecture decision: 'Daily Life' data must appear in the first scroll, before amenity lists, before house rules, before the proposal CTA. The focusing illusion operates on whatever is attended to first.

Kahneman Ch 38: 'Adaptation to a new situation consists in large part of thinking less and less about it.' The experiencing self is governed by daily activities; the space becomes background. But the remembering self needs memorable moments to compose a positive lease narrative. Without designed information touchpoints, the middle of the lease becomes a narrative void -- the remembering self has nothing to store between the move-in peak and the lease ending. Duration neglect (Ch 35: 'duration of the procedure had no effect whatsoever on the ratings of total pain') means this void costs the platform nothing in the short term -- the guest is fine moment-to-moment. But it costs the platform everything at retention, because the remembering self's evaluation is 'peak and end, nothing in between.' The active lease dashboard currently surfaces operational information: upcoming stays, date change tools, cleaning photos, payment status. These serve the experiencing self (daily operations) but are invisible to the remembering self unless something goes wrong. The information architecture needs a narrative layer -- moments where the platform surfaces reflective, memorable information that the remembering self can store.",
      "solution": "Add a narrative information layer to the active lease dashboard that creates memorable touchpoints at strategic intervals.

The card is small, unobtrusive, and entirely optional -- but its appearance is itself a memorable event that breaks the adaptation monotony. (2) Milestone markers: at meaningful intervals (first month, 10th stay, halfway point), a brief acknowledgment card surfaces: 'One month in [neighborhood].' These are narrative markers, not gamified badges. They serve the remembering self by creating distinct temporal anchors in what would otherwise be an undifferentiated duration. (3) Host connection prompts: once per lease (not per stay), the platform prompts the guest with an invitation to message the host. This is not a complaint mechanism; it is a relationship-building prompt: 'Your host [name] has been hosting you for [X] weeks. Say thanks or share feedback.' A positive host interaction during the lease becomes a peak the remembering self stores. (4) Seasonal or contextual highlights: if the lease spans a season change or neighborhood event, surface a brief contextual card: 'Spring is arriving in [neighborhood] -- the park two blocks from you opens its garden next week.'

      "problem": "The proposal is the guest's most significant affective forecast: they are predicting how they will feel living in this space for the proposed duration. Kahneman Ch 38 warns of 'miswanting -- bad choices that arise from errors of affective forecasting.' The focusing illusion at proposal time means the guest is overweighting whatever they last attended to on the listing page. If they last looked at photos, they overweight aesthetics. If they last saw the price, they overweight cost. The proposal form itself compounds the problem: it surfaces duration (weeks), schedule (days per week), and calculated price as the primary decision elements. These are all abstract parameters that tell the guest nothing about what the experience will actually be like. The user stories confirm that 'the proposal form should pre-populate with listing details so that I don't have to re-enter what the host already knows.' Pre-population reduces friction but does not address the affective forecasting error -- the guest is still making an abstract projection about future weeks. During negotiation, the information architecture problem shifts: the host's counter-proposal arrives as changed parameters (different duration, different price), and the guest's focusing illusion snaps to what was lost (Kahneman's loss aversion). If the counter arrives as raw parameter changes, the guest processes it as rejection. If the counter arrives with the host's human explanation and a clear summary of what remains, the guest processes it as negotiation.",
      "solution": "Redesign the proposal and negotiation information architecture to calibrate the affective forecast and humanize the counter-proposal. (1) Proposal form: pre-populate fields as the user stories prescribe, but add a 'What to expect' callout above the form. This callout surfaces one review excerpt and one experiencing-self data point (commute time, neighborhood vibe) from the listing. Its function is to inject experienced-utility information into the decision-utility moment, counteracting the focusing illusion. (2) Duration framing: instead of presenting duration as '16 weeks,' frame it narratively: '16 weeks -- that is about 4 months in [neighborhood], through [season].' This makes the abstract duration concrete and helps the guest imagine the actual experience rather than the numerical parameter. (3) Counter-proposal information architecture: when the host counter-proposes, the guest's view should lead with the host's message (the human element), followed by a clear comparison of original and counter terms (side-by-side, highlighting what changed and what stayed the same), followed by the guest's action options (accept, counter back, message). The host's message is the peak of the negotiation episode; the parameter changes are the supporting detail. Lead with the human element to anchor the guest's focusing illusion on the relationship rather than the loss. (4) Negotiation summary: throughout the negotiation, maintain a running summary visible to the guest: 'You proposed [X]. [Host Name] suggested [Y]. Here is where you agree: [common ground].' This focuses attention on common ground rather than differences, counteracting loss aversion.",
