      "title": "Peak-Moment Visual Amplification for Move-In Welcome and Lease-End Gratitude",
      "journey_phases": ["move_in", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's peak-end rule establishes that the guest's entire lease memory is determined by two moments: the peak (typically move-in) and the end (final departure). These moments must be visually distinguished from the routine dashboard experience. If the move-in welcome card and the lease-end gratitude card look identical to a weekly stay card or a notification banner, the remembering self does not register them as significant. Visual distinction IS peak intensity. The user stories analysis does not address move-in or lease-end visual design, which confirms the gap: these moments receive no deliberate visual treatment. The platform's default visual language (uniform cards, consistent spacing, neutral backgrounds) is designed for the experiencing self's daily operations. But the remembering self needs visual events -- moments where the interface itself signals 'this is important, store this.'",
      "solution": "Create a distinct visual language for peak moments that breaks from the operational design system in controlled ways. (1) Move-in welcome card: use surface-warm (#fdfcfa) as the card background instead of the standard surface (#ffffff). Apply the lg shadow (0 8px 30px rgba(26,23,20,0.10)) instead of the standard sm shadow, creating a visual lift that signals importance. The host's welcome message uses Instrument Serif at a larger scale (24px) for the opening line, breaking from the standard Outfit body text. This typographic shift signals narrative significance -- this is not a notification, it is a personal message. A subtle accent-light (#e8f0eb) border on the left edge of the card creates a warmth indicator that distinguishes it from all other dashboard elements. (2) Lease-end gratitude card: use the same elevated visual treatment (lg shadow, serif opening line, warm surface) with an additional element: a horizontal summary bar across the top showing total stays, duration, and host name in the mono evidence register (IBM Plex Mono, 14px, ink-soft color). This bar functions as a visual artifact -- it feels like a receipt of experience, something the guest's memory can attach to. The combination of serif warmth (narrative) and mono precision (evidence) creates a visual duality that serves both the emotional and factual needs of the remembering self. (3) Both cards include a full-bleed photo element: at move-in, the listing's hero photo anchors the card. At lease-end, the guest's own photo (if captured via the 'make it count' prompt) or the listing photo is displayed. The photo creates the visual peak that the remembering self captures.",

      "problem": "The listing card in search results is the primary surface where the remembering self's search prototype is formed. Kahneman Ch 35: 'System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes, not by sums.' The visual quality of the listing card determines the quality of the prototype. Currently, the card provides a single static photo, a title, a price, and minimal metadata. This visual simplicity provides one peak opportunity (the photo). The user stories prescribe 'richer hover states, image counters, availability indicators, neighborhood labels, and quick actions -- all without leaving the search grid.' Each enrichment is a visual peak opportunity. The visual challenge is to add these layers without creating cognitive overload -- the card must feel richer, not busier. Kahneman's focusing illusion means whatever is visually most prominent on the card becomes the evaluation lens. If the photo dominates, the guest evaluates aesthetically. If price dominates, they evaluate financially. If neighborhood context is visually present, they evaluate experientially. The visual hierarchy of the card IS the focusing illusion's direction.",
      "solution": "Design the listing card as a layered visual surface that reveals richness progressively. (1) Photo carousel layer: the primary visual element occupies the top 60% of the card. Multiple images with navigation dots (not arrows -- dots are lighter and do not obscure the image). Image counter badge ('1/5') positioned in the bottom-right corner of the photo area using ink (#1a1714) text on a semi-transparent bg (rgba(255,255,255,0.85)) with radius-sm (6px). On hover, the carousel auto-advances with a 3-second interval. (2) Neighborhood identity layer: immediately below the photo, a compact line showing the neighborhood label and transit indicator. Typography: Outfit 13px, weight 500, ink-soft color. Transit icon (Feather map-pin or navigation, 14px) in accent (#2d5a3d). This layer creates the experiential identity that the remembering self stores: 'the Williamsburg place near the L.' (3) Metadata layer: price (Outfit 18px, weight 600, ink color), duration range (Outfit 13px, ink-muted), and availability signal. Availability match uses accent (#2d5a3d) text: 'Available your dates.' No match uses ink-muted. (4) Hover enhancement layer: on hover or focus, the card lifts slightly (translateY(-2px), transition 200ms ease-out) and the md shadow upgrades to lg. A quick-action bar appears at the card bottom: Save (heart icon), Message (message-circle icon), View (arrow-right icon) -- all in ink-ghost color, accent on hover.

      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 38 identifies the focusing illusion as the primary distortion in affective forecasting: 'Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.' On the listing detail page, the guest is making their most consequential affective forecast: 'how will I feel living here for X weeks?' The page's visual layout determines what the guest attends to while making this forecast. If photos occupy the full viewport width and text content appears below the fold, the focusing illusion anchors entirely on aesthetics. If livability data (commute, neighborhood, reviews) is visually subordinate to photos, it participates minimally in the forecast. The result is a systematic gap between forecasted utility (based on how the space looks) and experienced utility (based on how the space functions daily). The user stories identify that 'the map should show transit stops, landmarks, and points of interest' and that 'verified reviews and host credibility signals activate guests.' Both are experiential data sources. But if the visual layout buries them below multiple scrolls of photos and descriptions, the focusing illusion never incorporates them.",

This ensures the guest's first viewport combines aesthetic impression with experiential context. (2) First scroll: reviews section. Full-width, using surface-warm (#fdfcfa) background to create visual distinction from the white photo section. Lead with a review summary bar: average rating (Outfit 28px, weight 700, ink), review count, and 3-4 experience tags extracted from reviews (e.g., 'great natural light,' 'quiet street,' 'responsive host'). Review tags use accent-light (#e8f0eb) pill backgrounds with accent (#2d5a3d) text. (3) Second scroll: detailed amenities, house rules (expandable sections), and host profile.

This creates a coherent visual language: 'serif + warm surface = narrative moment.' The guest learns this visual code and recognizes milestone cards as personal, not operational. The controlled use of Instrument Serif exclusively for narrative moments preserves its distinctiveness and prevents it from becoming visual wallpaper."

      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 38's focusing illusion means the guest evaluates listings through whatever lens the visual design foregrounds. Most rental platforms foreground photos and price, producing photo-focused and price-focused evaluations. But Kahneman Ch 37 shows that experienced well-being during a lease is determined by 'the current situation' -- commute, social contact, noise, daily activities. The neighborhood is the current situation for a Split Lease guest: they live, commute, eat, and socialize in it. Yet neighborhood information is typically communicated through plain text or a basic map pin -- visual treatments that are functionally correct but emotionally flat. The user stories identify that 'the map should feel alive: transit stops, landmarks, real-time context -- this is about mood, not just utility.' The visual challenge is to create a neighborhood presentation that communicates mood (the experiencing self's daily environment) not just utility (distance in blocks), so the guest's focusing illusion incorporates the neighborhood into their listing evaluation as vividly as they incorporate photos.",
      "solution": "Create a consistent neighborhood visual vocabulary that appears on both listing cards and detail pages. (1) Neighborhood identity pill: a compact visual element showing the neighborhood name + primary transit line. Uses a bg (#f6f4f0) background pill with radius-full (9999px), accent (#2d5a3d) transit icon (14px Feather navigation-2), Outfit 12px weight 500 in ink-soft. This pill appears on every listing card and at the top of every listing detail page, creating a visual pattern the guest learns: 'the pill tells me where this is.' (2) Transit proximity indicator: on the listing detail page's Daily Life sidebar, transit lines are shown with colored route indicators (MTA blue, green, orange as appropriate) and walking time in IBM Plex Mono (precision register). The visual treatment borrows from transit system design language, which guests already understand. (3) Neighborhood essentials strip: a horizontal strip of 3 icons with labels (coffee-cup icon + '3 min,' shopping-bag icon + '5 min,' train icon + '2 min'). Uses Outfit 12px, ink-muted for labels, with icons in ink-ghost at 16px. This strip appears on both the listing card (hover state) and the detail page (Daily Life sidebar, always visible). The consistent visual presence across surfaces creates the experiential identity that the remembering self stores alongside the listing's photos.",

      "journey_phases": ["negotiation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's loss aversion (referenced throughout Part V and foundational to prospect theory) predicts that a host's counter-proposal will be experienced as a loss by the guest. If the guest proposed 16 weeks and the host countered with 10, the guest's focusing illusion snaps to the lost 6 weeks. The visual treatment of the counter-proposal determines whether the guest processes it as a loss (negative peak in the negotiation narrative) or as a negotiation (neutral-to-positive episode). If changed terms are highlighted in red or with strikethrough (the typical diff pattern), the visual language amplifies the loss signal. If unchanged terms are visually prominent and changed terms are presented neutrally (not as errors), the visual language foregrounds what was preserved rather than what was lost. The remembering self stores the negotiation episode as defined by its peak moment: a loss-framed counter produces a negative peak; a common-ground-framed counter produces a neutral or positive peak.",
      "solution": "Design the counter-proposal view to visually foreground common ground and contextualize changes without loss framing. (1) Common ground section first: a compact summary of agreed terms (any parameter the host did not change) displayed in accent (#2d5a3d) on accent-light (#e8f0eb) background. Header: 'Where you agree' in Outfit 14px weight 600. This section appears first, establishing that the negotiation is largely resolved before the guest encounters changes. (2) Changes section second: changed terms displayed in a neutral two-column comparison (your proposal | host's suggestion). Use ink (#1a1714) for both columns -- no red, no strikethrough, no 'rejected' language. The changed value in the host's column uses ink with Outfit weight 600 (bolder to draw attention) but in the same color as the original (no alarm signal). A brief host explanation accompanies each change (the host's message from L1 works-004). (3) Host's personal message displayed above both sections: the human element anchors the focusing illusion on the relationship before the guest processes any parameter changes. Typography: Instrument Serif 16px for the opening line of the host's message (signaling narrative warmth), Outfit 14px for the body. (4) Action bar: 'Accept' (primary CTA in accent, bold), 'Adjust Terms' (secondary outline), 'Message [Host Name]' (tertiary text link).
