      "journey_phases": ["acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "Move-in is the single most consequential moment in the entire guest journey from the remembering self's perspective. Kahneman's peak-end rule (Ch 35) demonstrates that 'the global retrospective rating was well predicted by the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and at its end.' Move-in is almost certainly the peak of the lease experience -- the first moment of maximum novelty, maximum contrast with prior living, and maximum gap between affective forecast and experienced reality. Yet the platform treats move-in as logistics: key handoff, house manual access, settling in. The journey map describes it as 'First impressions, key handoff, settling in. Reality vs. listing expectations.' This is a list of operational steps, not a designed peak experience. The user stories analysis does not address move-in at all, which signals how little deliberate design attention this moment receives. A negative move-in peak (space does not match photos, confusing access, absent host, unclear rules) will define the guest's memory of the entire 4-16 week lease. A positive peak (space exceeds expectations, warm personal welcome, a small thoughtful touch) will anchor a positive narrative that protects against weeks of mundane adaptation. The peak is currently left to chance and host behavior. It must be designed.",
      "solution": "Create a structured move-in experience sequence that manufactures a positive peak through three mechanisms. (1) Pre-arrival peak priming: 24 hours before check-in, the platform sends the guest a personalized welcome message that includes the host's name, a photo of the space (the best photo from the listing), and specific check-in instructions. This creates anticipation -- Kahneman Ch 36 notes that 'the frenetic picture taking of many tourists suggests that storing memories is often an important goal, which shapes both the plans for the vacation and the experience of it.' The pre-arrival message shapes the guest's expectations and begins the narrative of arrival. (2) First-hour experience checklist: a digital 'welcome card' accessible from the guest's dashboard that surfaces during the first 24 hours after check-in. It contains: the host's personal welcome note (required from the host at listing creation), a curated 3-item neighborhood guide (coffee, grocery, transit -- the essentials that signal 'you belong here'), and a single prompt: 'How does the space feel?' with three options (Great / Good / Something's off). This prompt captures the peak moment in real time -- the guest's first impression is recorded and can trigger immediate intervention if negative. (3) Host welcome ritual: the platform prompts the host 48 hours before check-in to prepare a welcome action (a message, a small note, or a specific instruction). The host's welcome action is surfaced to the guest as part of the check-in flow, creating a human connection peak that the remembering self stores as the defining moment of arrival.",

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's peak-end rule means the ending of the lease experience will, along with the peak, disproportionately determine the guest's retrospective evaluation and rebooking decision. Ch 36 makes this explicit: 'the intentions for future vacations were entirely determined by the final evaluation -- even when that score did not accurately represent the quality of the experience described in the diaries.' The guest's rebooking decision is made by the remembering self, which weights the end of the lease equally with the peak. Yet the platform has no designed lease-end experience. The journey map shows per-stay reviews and cleaning photos but no end-of-lease ceremony. The guest's final interaction with Split Lease is administrative: final stay checkout, deposit return, maybe a review prompt. If the lease ends with administrative friction (unclear checkout process, delayed deposit, no acknowledgment from the platform or host), that administrative ending becomes the END that the peak-end rule weights so heavily. Kahneman's colonoscopy study (Ch 35) showed that 'gradual relief may be preferable to abrupt relief if patients retain a better memory when the pain at the end of the procedure is relatively mild.' An abrupt lease ending -- last stay, done, silence -- is the equivalent of abrupt relief: functionally complete but producing a flat or negative memory.",
      "solution": "Design a three-phase lease-end sequence that creates a gradual, warm conclusion. (1) Anticipation phase (7 days before final stay): the guest receives a 'Your lease is wrapping up' notification that surfaces their lease summary -- total stays completed, host relationship duration, neighborhood highlights. This is not a transactional notice; it is a narrative closing: 'You have been in [neighborhood] for [X] weeks.' The emotional register is reflective, not administrative. (2) Final stay enhancement: during the guest's last stay, the platform surfaces a 'Make it count' prompt that suggests the guest take a photo of their favorite feature of the space or send a thank-you message to the host. This creates a self-directed positive peak in the final stay that the remembering self will store as the ending. (3) Post-lease gratitude moment: within 24 hours of the final departure, the guest sees a full-screen 'lease complete' card showing their lease narrative (dates, stays, host name) with the host's closing message (prompted from the host 48 hours before the final stay) and a rebooking prompt. The closing message from the host is the human warmth that converts an administrative ending into a narrative ending.

      "journey_phases": ["search", "listing_evaluation"],
      "problem": "Search is where the experiencing self is most active -- the guest browses listings moment-to-moment. But Kahneman's framework warns that none of this browsing will be retained by the remembering self in proportion to time spent. Ch 35 reveals that 'System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes, not by sums.' The entire search session will be represented by one prototypical listing -- the best one encountered -- not by the sum of all listings viewed. Duration neglect means a 45-minute search is remembered no differently than a 10-minute one. The peak-end rule means the best listing encountered and the last listing viewed before exit determine the entire memory. The user stories analysis identifies specific mechanisms for creating peaks: 'each listing card to show a photo carousel with navigation arrows so that I preview multiple images without leaving search results' and 'richer hover states, image counters, availability indicators, neighborhood labels, and quick actions.' These are peak-manufacturing features -- each enrichment layer increases the probability that a listing card triggers a vivid positive moment. Currently, the cards work but leave 'engagement on the table.' From the Two Selves perspective, engagement on the table is peak probability on the table, which is retention on the table.",
      "solution": "Redesign the listing card to maximize peak probability per impression. (1) Photo carousel with visible navigation: multiple images per card create multiple opportunities for a visual peak. A single static photo provides one chance; a 5-image carousel provides five. The carousel should auto-advance on hover to surface visually rich content without requiring clicks. (2) Neighborhood context layer: show the transit stop, the landmark, the vibe label ('quiet tree-lined block in Williamsburg'). Kahneman Ch 38 on the focusing illusion: 'nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.' If the guest is thinking about the neighborhood context while viewing a listing, the neighborhood becomes the listing's identity in memory. A listing with a neighborhood identity ('the Williamsburg brownstone near the L train') is more memorable than an anonymous one. (3) Availability signal: show whether the listing's dates align with the guest's needs immediately on the card. An availability match is a peak -- it resolves the fundamental question ('can I actually stay here?') without requiring a page transition. The search session should end well: the last listing viewed before exit should ideally be a strong positive. Smart sorting that places the best-matching listings at the top increases the probability that the guest's last view before they click into a listing is a positive one, but the last card visible in the feed (the one they see before scrolling back up or leaving) should also be strong.",

      "title": "Use Messaging to Create a Human Interaction Peak Before Commitment",
      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation", "negotiation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 36 observes that 'we all care intensely for the narrative of our own life and very much want it to be a good story, with a decent hero.' The guest's booking narrative needs a human moment -- a point where the story shifts from 'I browsed a website' to 'I connected with a person.' Without messaging, the narrative jumps directly from 'I liked the photos' to 'I submitted a proposal,' which is a gap in the story. This gap makes the proposal feel like a transactional leap rather than a narrative progression. The user stories analysis confirms: 'Messaging before proposals is a natural step. The park analogy holds -- you check availability before committing. A message action reduces abandonment when someone isn't ready for a proposal. Once someone messages a host, the path to a proposal gets shorter, not longer.' The Two Selves lens explains the mechanism: messaging creates a memorable human interaction peak that the remembering self stores as evidence of connection and safety. The guest who messages and receives a warm response has a richer narrative ('I reached out, the host responded, I felt good about it') than the guest who silently evaluates. This richer narrative supports commitment because the remembering self has a story to tell. During negotiation, the same principle applies with even higher stakes: Kahneman's loss aversion means a counter-proposal feels like rejection. A host's warm message accompanying the counter ('I'd love to have you, but 10 weeks works better') converts the remembering self's narrative from 'they rejected my terms' to 'we worked it out.'",
      "solution": "Make messaging the primary bridge between listing evaluation and proposal creation, and ensure human warmth accompanies every negotiation interaction. (1) Prominent message action on the listing page: the 'Contact Host' button should be as visually prominent as the 'Create Proposal' button. The user stories confirm that messaging 'is the highest cross-activation story in the list' because 'that's not just UX convenience -- it's the moment two strangers begin to trust each other through the platform.' Position the message action as the natural first step, not an alternative to proposing. (2) Host response velocity matters for memory: the guest's remembering self stores the messaging interaction as a single episode. If the host responds quickly, the episode is 'I asked, they answered -- they are responsive.' If the response takes days, the episode is 'I asked and waited.' Kahneman's peak-end rule applied to the messaging episode: the quality of the host's response (the peak) and the elapsed time (experienced as the end) determine the memory. Surface estimated response times on the listing page to set expectations. (3) Messaging context in negotiation: when a host counter-proposes, the platform must prompt the host to include a personal message with the counter-terms. A counter-proposal without a message is experienced as a rejection; a counter with a warm explanation is experienced as a conversation. The platform should provide a message template: 'Tell [Guest Name] why these terms work better for you.' The human message converts a transactional counter into a narrative of mutual accommodation.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 38 introduces the focusing illusion: 'Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.' When the guest evaluates a listing, they are thinking about the listing's most prominent features -- typically its best photos, its location label, and its price. The focusing illusion inflates these features into a global evaluation that may not predict the guest's actual experienced well-being during the lease. Kahneman Ch 36's 'amnesic vacation' thought experiment reveals this: 'if the guest knew they would forget the entire lease, would they still choose the same listing?' The guest who chooses an 'instagrammable' space (photo-worthy, narrative-rich) over a 'livable' space (comfortable, functional, good commute) is serving their remembering self at the expense of their experiencing self. The listing page design, which leads with photos and descriptions, inadvertently encourages this bias. The user stories analysis confirms a related problem: 'Verified reviews and host credibility signals activate guests.' Reviews are the closest the platform gets to experiencing-self information -- they report what it was actually like to live there. But if reviews are buried below photos and descriptions, the focusing illusion ensures photos dominate the evaluation. The proposal moment compounds the problem: Kahneman Ch 38 identifies 'miswanting -- bad choices that arise from errors of affective forecasting.' The guest creating a proposal is forecasting how they will feel living in this space, and that forecast is driven by whatever they are currently attending to. If they are attending to a beautiful living room photo, they overweight its importance for their daily happiness -- forgetting that, per Kahneman Ch 38, 'adaptation to a new situation consists in large part of thinking less and less about it.'",
      "solution": "Balance remembering-self information (photos, descriptions, narrative features) with experiencing-self information (what it is actually like to live there day-to-day) in the listing evaluation flow. (1) Surface 'livability data' alongside photos: commute times to major transit, noise level indicators, nearby amenities (grocery, laundry, gym). These are experiencing-self features that predict daily well-being but are invisible to the focusing illusion when photos dominate. Position livability data in the second scan zone of the listing page -- after photos capture attention but before the guest commits to a proposal. (2) Promote reviews to the first scroll: verified reviews are the best source of experiencing-self data the platform has. Move the review section above amenity lists and rule details. The user stories note that 'verified reviews and host credibility signals activate guests.' Reviews activate precisely because they are reports from other experiencing selves -- they provide the information that counteracts the focusing illusion. (3) Affective forecast calibration at proposal creation: when the guest opens the proposal form, show a brief prompt: 'Guests who stayed here said: [top review excerpt].' This introduces an experiencing-self data point at the exact moment the guest is making an affective forecast, reducing the gap between forecasted and experienced utility.",

      "problem": "Duration neglect is one of Kahneman's most counterintuitive findings: 'doubling the duration of Jen's life had no effect whatsoever on the desirability of her life.' Applied to Split Lease: a 16-week lease is remembered no differently than a 4-week lease. The guest who had 4 good weeks with a warm move-in and a positive ending will rate the experience higher -- and be more likely to rebook -- than the guest who had 16 mediocre weeks with no designed peaks. Yet the platform's implicit assumption is that longer leases are inherently more valuable. The proposal form encourages longer durations through pricing incentives. The Stays Manager tracks weeks as if cumulative time creates cumulative value. But Kahneman Ch 35 is unambiguous: 'Duration of the procedure had no effect whatsoever on the ratings of total pain.' The experiencing self accumulates moments over 16 weeks; the remembering self retains only the peak and the end. This means the platform is investing in the experiencing self's daily reality (which is important for ethical reasons) but is not investing in the remembering self's summary (which determines retention). The platform needs a parallel strategy: make the daily experience good (experiencing self) while also engineering memorable peaks at strategic intervals (remembering self).",
      "solution": "Design the active lease phase with deliberate peak moments at regular intervals, rather than relying on the uniformity of the daily experience. (1) Mid-lease check-in: at the midpoint of any lease longer than 8 weeks, the platform prompts a brief 'How's it going?' moment. This is not a survey; it is a reflection prompt that creates a memorable touchpoint. If the guest responds positively, the platform reinforces: 'Great to hear. You are halfway through -- [X] stays to go.' If the guest signals concern, the platform triggers a human intervention (agent outreach, host notification). The mid-lease check-in is a designed peak opportunity: it breaks the monotony of adaptation (Kahneman Ch 38: 'adaptation consists in large part of thinking less and less about it') and forces the guest to attend to their current state, creating a moment the remembering self can store. (2) Guest milestone celebrations: when the guest completes their 5th stay, their 10th stay, or reaches a significant date (one month in), the platform surfaces a brief milestone acknowledgment. These are not gamified badges; they are narrative markers: 'You have been in [neighborhood] for a month now.' Each marker creates a peak that breaks duration neglect by giving the remembering self something to remember about the middle of the lease. (3) Proposal-stage expectation management: at proposal creation, surface the principle directly: 'Whether your lease is 4 weeks or 16, the moments that matter are the ones you will remember -- your arrival, your favorite spot in the space, and how it all wraps up.' This reframes the duration decision from 'more weeks = more value' to 'the right duration for your story.'",

          "insight": "The guest's retrospective evaluation of a 16-week lease is not proportionally better than a 4-week lease.
