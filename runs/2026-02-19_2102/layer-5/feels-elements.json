      "journey_phases": ["move_in"],
      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 35 establishes that 'the global retrospective rating was well predicted by the average of the level of pain reported at the worst moment of the experience and at its end.' Move-in is the moment of maximum novelty -- every sensation is being registered at full intensity because the guest is contrasting the new space with their prior living situation, with the listing photos, with their expectations. The focusing illusion (Ch 38) is at maximum strength: whatever the guest notices first will define the space in memory. A stain on the counter noticed first will define the space as 'the place with the stain,' no matter how beautiful the living room. A personal welcome note noticed first will define the space as 'the place where I was expected.' The emotional design challenge is that this moment is currently unmanaged -- the peak is left to chance and host behavior. Some guests arrive to warm welcomes; others arrive to empty, silent spaces. The platform treats all move-ins identically: access code, house manual, go. But Kahneman Ch 35 is clear: 'lowering the peak intensity of pain could be more important than minimizing the duration of the procedure.' Engineering a positive move-in peak is more important than anything that happens during weeks 2-16.",
      "solution": "The move-in must feel like being welcomed into someone's thoughtfully prepared space, not like checking into a hotel. The emotional arc is: anticipation (pre-arrival message builds excitement) > arrival (space meets or exceeds the photo-formed expectations) > recognition (the host's welcome message makes the guest feel personally expected) > orientation (neighborhood essentials answer the 'now what?' question before anxiety forms). The emotional design levers: (1) The pre-arrival message (24 hours before) creates anticipatory pleasure -- Kahneman's research on happiness shows that anticipation of a positive event is itself a positive experience. The message should feel like a countdown to something exciting, not a logistics briefing. (2) The welcome card's full-screen takeover commands attention at the peak-sensitivity moment, directing the focusing illusion toward warmth and preparation rather than allowing it to land on the first flaw. (3) The host's personal message creates the human peak -- the guest reads something written specifically for them. This is the narrative moment the remembering self stores: 'I was expected.' (4) The 'How does the space feel?' prompt captures the peak impression in real time, which serves two purposes: it gives the platform actionable data, and it gives the guest a moment of metacognition that amplifies the positive (reflecting on a positive feeling deepens it).",

      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 36: 'The intentions for future vacations were entirely determined by the final evaluation -- even when that score did not accurately represent the quality of the experience described in the diaries.' The guest's rebooking decision is entirely determined by how the lease ends. The platform currently offers no designed emotional ending. The guest's final interaction is administrative: last checkout, possibly a review prompt, deposit processing. This administrative ending produces an administrative memory. The remembering self stores: 'it ended, I moved out, there was some paperwork.' This memory does not motivate rebooking. A warm ending -- where the guest feels acknowledged, nostalgic, and connected to the host and neighborhood -- produces a memory that the remembering self wants to repeat. Kahneman Ch 35's cold-hand experiment proved that subjects chose to repeat experiences that ended well, 'thereby declaring themselves willing to suffer 30 seconds of needless pain in the anticipated third trial.' A positive ending can override mediocre middle weeks. The inverse is equally true: a negative or flat ending can override excellent middle weeks.",

The emotional arc across the three-phase sequence (L4, behaves-002): Phase 1 (Reflection, 7 days before): the emotion is bittersweet anticipation. The guest is invited to look back: 'What will you remember most?' The copy is reflective, not urgent. The feeling is: 'this chapter is closing, and it was a good one.' Phase 2 (Farewell, during final stay): the emotion is human warmth. The host's closing message arrives -- a personal thank-you, a memory shared, a door left open. The neighborhood essentials are re-surfaced as a farewell: 'Your spots in Williamsburg.' The feeling is: 'these people and this place mattered.' Phase 3 (Gratitude, 24 hours after departure): the emotion is accomplishment with forward momentum. The lease summary shows what the guest experienced. Their own memory response is displayed back to them. The rebooking prompt appears naturally: 'Stay in [neighborhood]?' The feeling is: 'that was a good story, and I can start another one.'",

      "problem": "Search is the experiencing self's domain -- the guest is browsing moment-to-moment, scrolling through listings. But Kahneman Ch 35 warns: 'System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, and prototypes, not by sums.' The search session will be prototyped by one card impression. If no card creates an emotional peak (a vivid 'I could live there' moment), the entire session is remembered as fruitless -- regardless of how many listings were viewed. Duration neglect means a 45-minute search produces the same memory as a 10-minute one if neither produced a peak. The user stories prescribe richer cards ('more layers, more engagement'), and the Two Selves lens explains why: each enrichment layer is a peak opportunity. But the emotional design must go beyond features to address the feeling of the search. A search session with rich cards can still feel exhausting if the emotional register is wrong. Listings must not just be informative; they must be inviting. The guest must not just see data; they must feel possibility.",

The feel is aspirational but grounded -- not luxury advertising, but 'this could be my Tuesday morning.' (2) Neighborhood label as identity, not data: 'Williamsburg -- 3 min to L' is not just transit information; it is a lifestyle signal. The guest does not process this as data; they process it as possibility. The emotional design must ensure the label feels contextual and evocative, not clinical. (3) Availability match as resolution: when a card shows 'Available your dates,' the guest experiences a micro-peak of possibility resolved into reality. The emotional register shifts from 'I could live there' to 'I can live there.' This resolution is the peak moment the remembering self stores from the search. (4) End-of-results curation: the user stories warn against proposal-from-search-card ('premature -- they'll still open the listing before committing'). But the emotional design should ensure the search session does not end on a weak note.

Kahneman Ch 36 adds: 'we all care intensely for the narrative of our own life and very much want it to be a good story.' The guest's booking narrative needs a human chapter -- a moment where they connected with a real person. Without messaging, the narrative is: 'I browsed photos, I submitted a proposal, I got a confirmation.' This is a transaction story. With messaging, the narrative becomes: 'I found a great space, I reached out to the host, they responded warmly, I decided to stay.' This is a relationship story. The remembering self stores relationship stories more vividly than transaction stories because they involve human peaks. During negotiation, the emotional stakes are even higher. A counter-proposal without a human message is experienced as rejection (loss aversion). A counter with a warm explanation is experienced as conversation. The emotional design of messaging determines whether the booking narrative is transactional or relational, which determines whether the remembering self wants to repeat it.",

(2) Host response display: when the host responds, the notification should feel personal: '[Host name] replied.' Not 'New message from your inquiry.' The response appears on the listing page in a conversational thread format -- the guest sees the exchange as a dialogue, not as request-response. (3) Conversation continuity in negotiation: when the host counter-proposes, the guest's prior messages with the host are visible above the counter-proposal, establishing narrative continuity. The guest sees: their question, the host's response, the host's personal message with the counter.

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "Kahneman Ch 37 shows that experienced well-being is determined by 'the current situation' -- not by the space's aesthetic qualities (which are adapted to within days) but by daily activities, social contact, noise, and stress. During the active lease, the guest adapts to the space (Ch 38: 'thinking less and less about it') and their moment-to-moment well-being is governed by their real-world situation, not by the platform. The platform's leverage during the active lease is therefore limited -- it cannot control the guest's job, relationships, or daily activities. But it CAN do two things: (1) prevent negative peaks that disrupt the experiencing self's daily contentment (disputes, surprise date changes, communication breakdowns), and (2) create occasional positive peaks that the remembering self can store (mid-lease check-ins, milestone markers, host connection moments). The emotional design challenge is maintaining a steady baseline of quiet contentment (the experiencing self's daily state) while punctuating it with designed memorable moments (the remembering self's stored peaks). Too many punctuations become noise; too few leave the middle of the lease as a mnemonic void.",
      "solution": "The active lease emotional design operates on two registers: (1) Baseline register: quiet, predictable, invisible-when-working. The stay cycle (arrival, stay, departure, cleaning) should feel like a well-maintained clock -- the guest knows the rhythm and does not think about it. The emotional tone of routine notifications is factual and neutral: 'Your next stay starts Tuesday.' No celebration, no urgency, no emotional language for routine operations. The platform's role is to be so reliable that the guest forgets it is there. This reliability IS the experiencing self's contentment: the absence of friction, the absence of surprises, the absence of anxiety. Kahneman Ch 37: 'happiness is the experience of spending time with people you love' -- the platform should not try to be the source of happiness during the lease; it should remove obstacles to the guest's own happiness. (2) Peak register: warm, personal, rare. The milestone markers, mid-lease check-in, and host connection prompt (L4, behaves-005) use the warm narrative visual treatment (serif headline, surface-warm background) and a personal, reflective tone. These moments are rare by design -- one check-in, 2-3 milestones across a full lease -- so each one registers as special rather than routine. The emotional arc of the active lease is: steady contentment punctuated by brief moments of warmth and reflection.",

      "journey_phases": ["negotiation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's loss aversion, deeply embedded in Part V's framework, predicts that a counter-proposal feels like a loss. The guest proposed 16 weeks; the host suggested 10. The guest's System 1 processes: 'I lost 6 weeks.' The magnitude of this felt loss exceeds the objective value of the difference because losses loom larger than gains. If the counter-proposal arrives as bare numbers, the guest's peak emotion is loss -- and the peak-end rule means this loss defines the entire negotiation memory. The remembering self stores: 'they rejected me.' Even if the guest eventually accepts the 10-week counter, the negotiation narrative carries a rejection peak that undermines the lease relationship from the start. The user stories identify messaging as 'the moment two strangers begin to trust each other.' During negotiation, the trust that messaging built is at risk of being destroyed by a transactional counter-proposal. The emotional design must protect the relationship through the counter-proposal moment.",
      "solution": "The counter-proposal experience must feel like a conversation between two people working toward a shared goal, not like a market transaction where one party lost. (1) The host's voice first: the host's personal message is the first thing the guest encounters. The emotional register is: 'I want this to work, and here is how we can make it work.' The platform prompts the host to write with this register: 'Tell [Guest Name] why these terms work better for you -- they will appreciate the explanation.' (2) Common ground as emotional anchor: the 'Where you agree' section creates the emotional frame: 'we are mostly aligned.' This is not just an information architecture choice; it is an emotional one. The guest's System 1 processes agreement before processing change. By the time they see the changed terms, their emotional baseline is: 'we agree on most things.' The change feels like a minor adjustment within a relationship, not a rejection of their proposal. (3) Collaborative action options: 'Accept Sarah's suggestion' (not 'Accept counter-proposal'), 'Suggest a change' (not 'Counter-propose'), 'Message Sarah' (not 'Dispute'). Every action option uses the host's name and collaborative language. The guest never feels like they are in an adversarial negotiation. (4) If the guest needs time: the counter-proposal card persists without urgency. No countdown timers, no 'respond within 48 hours' pressure. The guest should feel they have the space to process the adjustment and respond thoughtfully, which produces a better emotional outcome than a pressured response.",
