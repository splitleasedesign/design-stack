Krug Ch. 1 warns that 'the fact that the people who built the site didn't care enough to make things obvious — and easy — can erode our confidence in the site and its publishers.' If the renewal process introduces friction, Drew's confidence erodes. The book's observation that 'your site may not have been that easy to find in the first place' (Ch. 1) cuts both ways: Drew may not easily find alternatives, but he also may not easily find the renewal path on the platform.",
