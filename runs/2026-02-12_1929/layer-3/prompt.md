No commentary, no markdown code fences, no explanation. Your entire response must be a single valid JSON object matching the schema in your agent instructions.

## Journey Context
- **Journey type**: host
- **User role**: You are analyzing the HOST journey â€” the perspective of a property owner or leaseholder who lists their space on Split Lease to find guests for shared living arrangements.
- **Call type**: Host call transcript
- **Journey phases** (fixed vocabulary for this run):
  discovery â†’ evaluation â†’ onboarding â†’ listing_creation â†’ pricing â†’ proposal_mgmt â†’ active_lease â†’ retention
- **Phase definitions**:
  - discovery: Host first hears about Split Lease (referral, ad, search). Deciding whether to explore.
  - evaluation: Host researches the platform. Compares to Craigslist, Airbnb, roommate apps. Reads about guarantees.
  - onboarding: Host signs up, verifies identity, connects with their assigned agent (e.g., Bryant). First call happens here.
  - listing_creation: Host creates their listing: photos, description, amenities, house rules, availability calendar.
  - pricing: Host sets nightly/weekly rates. Understands the payment model, guaranteed income, Split Lease fee structure.
  - proposal_mgmt: Host receives guest proposals, reviews them, counters terms, accepts or declines.
  - active_lease: Guest is living in the space. Host manages the ongoing relationship, payments, and any issues.
  - retention: Lease ends or renews. Host decides whether to list again, refer others, or leave the platform.

## Your Agent Instructions

# Layer 3: Visual Designer

You are the Visual Designer. You extract visual pattern elements â€” principles about how the host journey should look and feel visually.

## Core Question
What visual patterns does this lens reveal about how to express trust, clarity, and brand across the host journey?

## Conceptual Shift (v2)
You no longer produce mockup HTML files. You extract **visual pattern elements** â€” reusable principles about typography, color, spacing, and visual hierarchy that apply across the journey. These elements reference design tokens but don't produce pixel-perfect layouts.

## Your Inputs
- journey-context.json from Layer 0
- works-elements.json from Layer 1
- communicates-elements.json from Layer 2
- The lens pair: host call transcript + book extract
- Baseline: tokens.json, taste-model.md, site screenshots, Style-guide.md
- Existing element library (library/elements.json)

## Required Output: looks-elements.json

      "visual_hierarchy_rule": "<how this pattern affects what the eye sees first>",
      "brand_alignment": "<how this connects to taste-model.md principles>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rules
- Must reference tokens from library/tokens.json â€” do not invent colors or fonts without flagging them in `new_tokens_needed`
- Must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios minimum for any color recommendations
- Extract visual principles, not mockups. "Use mono font for data-backed claims to signal credibility" is a principle. "Set the badge to 12px IBM Plex Mono #2d5a3d" is a mockup spec.
- Reference taste-model.md for brand alignment (warm vs cool, round vs sharp, etc.)
- NO mockup.html output â€” visual principles only
- Aim for 3-8 elements per run

00:06 Hello? Hello. Hey, is this Drew? I ain't going to be talking to you. Thanks for taking the time to chat. How you doing?

00:18 I'm doing well. How are you? I'm good.

00:21 Good. Um, yeah, so like I had mentioned a shared Ariel and Amber and their LinkedIn's with you, and they're both interested in your space. I wanted to, um, chat a little about your space and then maybe ask you some questions. And if you had any questions for me, I'd be happy to answer those things,

00:40 Um, which I've got potluck. Exactly. You think it was be too much?

00:45 Uh, the title of it is the comfortable one bed, one bath.

00:49 One bedroom, one bath. Yep.

00:52 Yep. In Chelsea. Yep. Yep. To confirm that would be a 2000 a month, I think is what it's listed here. That's right. Okay.

01:03 Got it. And this is an entire apartment, is that right?

01:08 They had found one bedroom, one bath.

01:14 Okay. Got it. Um, and then is the space available now going to be available?

01:25 Okay. Do you know when this,

01:32 So Ariel and Amber are both flexible? Um, they're actually both, uh, if I can tell you a little bit about them, they're both in similar situations. So both of them have primary residences in Connecticut, uh, but they both work in Manhattan, which is why they're looking for a place. So essentially they'd be using this space as a place to come back to, uh, after work for when they're in the city. And then, um, there are other time will be spent, uh, at their primary residences in Connecticut.

02:02 Um, so they have, they have flexibility like right now they're currently just commuting to the city so they can really start, have a lot of flexibility when they could start. Um, I think ideally they want to start early March is what they had, let me know. But again, that's something that they can be flexible with.

02:22 Yeah.

02:27 Uh, do you have an idea of when the space. Okay, got it. Okay.

02:33 And um, so

02:41 Okay. The sixth. Okay. Got it. And then I'm guessing you have, um, is there maybe cleaning or things that need to happen after that, after that a tenant moves out? Is that right? Yeah. Okay.

02:57 Cleaning. Okay. Um, another question I had would be, uh, regarding security deposit or damage deposit. Is that something you charge? Uh, do you have a damage deposit? 1000. Okay. Got it. Um,

03:17 Got it. Uh, and I wanted to mention as well, so I know I mentioned Ariel and Amber and they were, so they originally came to me and the company that I worked for, which is called split lease individually, I, we match them as roommates. Uh, and a lot of the guests that we help are in similar situations to Ariel and Amber basically needing a place in the city for, um, when they're in the city for work and basically to come back to.

03:44 Uh, so basically we, uh, split lease doubled the deposit, um, and guarantees payments to you as the landlord. Uh, so that's all within our rental agreement, which I'd be happy to share with you. Um, but basically in the case that a guest would miss a payment, uh, that doesn't have any effect on you and you still receive, uh, the payment, uh, as well as we've vetted, both Ariel and Amber had been vetted and have, um, verified employment and income with us as well.

04:18 Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright.

04:21 Uh, one more question I had was about, uh, pictures of the space and wondered if you had any more, um, that you could share with me or maybe like a video tour or something like that.

04:38 Yes. I have more pictures and I can send you

04:46 Awesome. Yeah, that would be great. Um, okay. I think that was, Um, so yes, if you can text me your email address, I will send you pictures.

05:01 Sounds good. I'll do that. And then I can get back to you with more information on split lease as well as links to the, to the agreements which are referenced. Um, and I think those about it, any other questions for me major?

05:18 Uh, Uh, so they've indicated, ideally they'd want to start with a four months is what they indicated to me. Is that something that would work yep.

05:32 Four months and then maybe the ability to extend. Okay. Okay. Sounds good.

05:38 I'll be sure to get back to you with, uh, with more details as well. And if you have any questions for me, you can feel free to text me or email me on. I'll share my email right after this call. Alright.

05:50 Sounds good. Anything else for me? Drew

05:52 Sounds good. Okay. No, that'll be all. Doug and moving data. And though, let me just send you pictures and, um, did you do a, so we can maybe move on?

06:14 Yeah, that would be great. I'll send over my email so you will see.

About the Second Edition

"Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."
--michael corleone, in the godfather, part III
Since Don't Make Me Think was first published nearly five years ago, people
have been wonderful about the book. I get lots of lovely email. You can't imagine how nice it is to start your morning with someone you've never met telling you that they enjoyed something that you did. (I recommend it highly.) Even nicer is the fact that people seem to like the book for the same reasons I do. For instance: > Many people appreciate the fact that it's short. (Some have told me that they
actually read it on a plane ride, which was one of my stated objectives for the first edition; the record for "fastest read" seems to be about two hours.) > A gratifying number of people have said that they liked the book because it practices what it preaches, in the writing and the design. > Some people said it made them laugh out loud, which I really appreciated. (One reader said that I made her laugh so hard that milk came out of her nose. How can something like that help but make you feel that your time has been well spent?) But the most satisfying thing has been people saying that it helped them get their job done better.
But what have you done for us lately?
It only took about a year after the book appeared for people to start asking me when I was going to do a second edition. For a long time, I really resisted the idea. I liked the book the way it was and thought it worked well, and since it was about design principles and not technology, I didn't think it was likely to be out of date anytime soon.
[ vii ]

preface
Usually I'd pull the consultant/therapist trick of asking them what they would change, and the answer was almost always, "Well, I guess you could update the examples." Some people would point out that some of the sites in the examples didn't even exist anymore. But the fact is, many of the sites in the book were already gone by the time it hit the bookstores. (Remember, it came out right before the Internet bubble burst.) The fact that the sites weren't around didn't make the examples any less clear. Other people would say, "Well, you could talk about the things about the Web that have changed." It's true; some things about the Web have changed in the last few years. Some of the changes were good: > More good sites to copy from > Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) that actually work > Useful conventions like printer-friendly pages and Amazon.com's What's this? > Google as the starting point for all actions > The swing in business models from banner ads (for things I don't want) to
Google ads (for things I actually might want) > Hardly anyone uses frames anymore ...and some not so good: > Pop-ups > Phishing But these changes didn't make me feel a need to update the book, which is about design principles, not specifics of technology or implementation. And there was one other problem: I was very proud of how short the book was. It took a lot of work, but it was an important part of the "practices what it preaches" business. If I was going to add any new material, I'd have to throw some of the existing stuff overboard, and I thought it all worked pretty well.
[ viii ]

about the second edition
So, what are we doing here?
One of the nicest fringe benefits of the book for me is that I've been able to spend time teaching workshops. In the workshops, I try to do the same thing I did in the book: show people what I think about when I do a usability review of a Web site. And since everyone who comes to the workshops has already read the book, naturally I had to come up with different examples to make the same points, and different ways of explaining the same things. I also get to do a lot of reviews of different kinds of sites, because everyone who comes to the workshop can submit a URL, and during the day I do 12-minute "expert mini-reviews" of some of them, and a live user test of one or two others. And as anyone who's ever taught anything knows, teaching something is the best way to learn more about it. So when my publisher started asking about a second edition again last year, I actually thought about what a second edition might be like. And while I still felt there wasn't much I'd change or delete from the first edition, I realized I did have some other things I could write about that might be helpful.
Like what?
The new material mostly falls into three categories: > Oh, now I get it. Teaching the workshops has given me many chances to think
through what's in the book. There are a few things that I've rewritten slightly because I think I understand them a little better now, or I have a better way to explain them. > Help! My boss wants me to ______. A lot of the questions people ask in my workshops amount to "I know the right thing to do in this case, but my boss/client/stakeholders insist that I do the wrong thing. How can I convince them otherwise?"
[ ix ]

preface
Since many people seem to spend a lot of time trying to fight the same design issues, I thought it might be good to give them some ammunition. So I added Chapter 12, which covers problems like
My marketing manager insists that we make people provide a lot of unnecessary personal information before they can subscribe to our newsletter, and it doesn't seem to matter to him that 10% of our subscribers now happen to be named "Barney Rubble." > The "lost" chapters. There were two chapters I wanted to include in the first book, but didn't, mostly in the interest of keeping it short. One, Chapter 10, is about the importance of treating users well, and the other, Chapter 11, is about Web accessibility.
I also wanted to update and expand my recommended reading list, since some great books have come out in the past five years.
Five pounds of crackers in a four-pound box
Even though I'd gone from thinking the book was fine just the way it was, thank you, to feeling like I had a lot I wanted to add, I still had one major dilemma: If there wasn't anything I wanted to throw overboard, how could I add new material and still keep the book short enough for an airplane ride read?
Fortunately, at this point, I took my own advice and did a form of user testing: I set up a discussion board and asked readers of the first edition to tell me what I could leave out. And fortunately, the testing did what user testing always does: > Confirmed some things I already knew > Taught me some things I didn't know about how people were using the book,
and what they valued about it > Whacked me over the head with a big surprise that let me improve it
significantly
The big surprise was the large number of people who suggested moving the chapters on user testing to another book. (Some of them had heard that I was
[ x]

about the second edition
planning to do another book that would cover low-cost/no-cost do-it-yourself user testing in detail, and some said they wouldn't miss the chapters because they didn't plan on doing any testing themselves.) I'd thought of doing this, but I didn't want to because (a) I thought people would miss them, and (b) I thought it would feel like I was trying to force people to buy the second book. But as soon as I started reading what the users had to say, the solution became obvious: By compressing the three user testing chapters into one slightly shorter one that covers the important points everyone should know about, I could gain twenty more pages to use for new material. And for anyone who wanted the older, longer version, I could make the original chapters available for free on my Web site.1 Problem solved.
Finally, a few housekeeping notes: > The links. If you want to visit any of the URLs mentioned in the book,
you'll find up-to-date links on my site, too. (Just in case any of the sites, well, you know...disappear.) > Still not present at time of photo. The one thing people have asked me about that you still won't find in here is any discussion of Web applications. While a lot of the principles are the same as for Web sites, it's really a topic for a whole other book, and I'm not the person to write it.2 Anyway, thanks for all the fish. I hope you find the new bits useful. See you in five years.

Foreword >
don't make me think again
Considering how much has changed since 2000, when the first edition of this book was printed, it's amazing that the basic design of the Web has stayed so much the same. In the early years the platform was volatile. It seemed like features changed every week. We had the browser wars, with Netscape squaring off against all comers and the WC3 bringing out new HTML standards every six months. But then, with the predictable victory of the Redmond wehrmacht, everything settled down. This was a relief for Web designers, who were nearly driven out of their minds by the constant changes in code--and by the fact that we were making it up as we went along. But relief slowly faded into frustration. The inflexibility of HTML, the lack of fonts, the adjustability of Web pages that makes design so imprecise, the confusing array of screen resolutions and target browsers (even if they're mostly Explorer)--these factors are all annoying. Designers' aggravation is compounded by the slow coagulation of a number of restrictive conventions, like the use of banner ads. Not all conventions are bad
[ xii ]

of course. In fact, users like conventions--even if designers find them constraining. For most people, it's hard enough just to get the computer to work.
And while these conventions may change, there is one constant that never changes: human nature. As radical and disruptive a social and commercial force as the Internet has been, it has not yet caused a noticeable mutation in the species.
And since we designers do not, as a rule, come into contact with actual human beings, it is very helpful to know Steve Krug--or at least to have this book--because Steve does know users. After more than a decade of this work he continues to look at each Web site like it's the first one. You'll find no buzz words here: just common sense and a friendly understanding of the way we see, the way we think, and the way we read.
The principles Steve shares here are going to stay the same, no matter what happens with the Internet--with web conventions, or the operating system, or bandwidth, or computer power. So pull up a chair and relax.

Is this trip really necessary?
--slogan on world war ii posters encouraging gas rationing
W hen i started telling people that i was writing a book about how to do what I do, they all asked the same thing: "Aren't you afraid of putting yourself out of a job?" It's true, I have a great job. > People ("clients") send me proposed page designs for the new Web site they're
building or the URL of the existing site that they're redesigning.

> I look at the designs or use the site and figure out whether they're easy enough to
use (an "expert usability review"). Sometimes I pay other people to try to use the site while I watch ("usability testing").1

> I write a report describing the problems that I found that are likely to cause users grief ("usability issues") and suggesting possible solutions.2

A usability report

1 ...not to be confused with "voyeurism." 2 Actually, this is one thing that has changed since the first edition. See Chapter 9 for the
reason why I've pretty much stopped writing what I now refer to as the "big honking report."
[ 3]

introduction

> I work with the client's Web design team to help them figure out how to fix the problems.

...maybe if we put the top stories under the personalization promo...
Hey, look! Somebody brought donuts.

I wonder if there are any donuts left...

We could do it that way, but...

Sometimes we work by phone...
> They pay me.

...and sometimes in person

Being a consultant, I get to work on interesting projects with a lot of nice, smart people, and when we're finished, the sites are better than when we started. I get to work at home most of the time and I don't have to sit in mind-numbing meetings every day or deal with office politics. I get to say what I think, and people usually appreciate it. And I get paid well.
Believe me, I would not lightly jeopardize this way of life.3

But the reality is there are so many Web sites in need of help--and so few people who do what I do--that barring a total collapse of the Internet boom,4 there's
very little chance of my running out of work for years.

Suddenly a lot of people with little or no previous experience have been made responsible for big-budget projects that may determine the future of their companies, and they're looking for people to tell them that they're doing it right.

3 I have an even cushier job now. Since the book came out, I spend a lot of my time teaching workshops, where, unlike consulting, there's no opportuntiy to procrastinate and no homework. At the end of the day, you're done.
4 The boom obviously turned to bust not long after I wrote this (late in 2000). Even so, there are probably more people working on usability now than there were then.

[ 4]

read me first
Graphic designers and developers find themselves responsible for designing interfaces--things like interaction design (what happens next when the user clicks) and information architecture (how everything is organized). And most people don't have the budget to hire a usability consultant to review their work--let alone have one around all the time. I'm writing this book for people who can't afford to hire (or rent) someone like me. I would hope that it's also of value to people who work with a usability professional. At the very least, I hope it can help you avoid some of the endless, circular religious Web design debates that seem to eat up so much time.
It's not rocket surgeryTM
The good news is that much of what I do is just common sense, and anyone with some interest can learn to do it. After all, usability really just means making sure that something works well: that a person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can use the thing--whether it's a Web site, a fighter jet, or a revolving door--for its intended purpose without getting hopelessly frustrated. Like a lot of common sense, though, it's not necessarily obvious until after someone's pointed it out to you.5 No question: if you can afford to, hire someone like me. But if you can't, I hope this book will enable you to do it yourself (in your copious spare time).
5 ...which is one reason why my consulting business (actually just me and a few well-placed mirrors) is called Advanced Common Sense. "It's not rocket surgery" is my corporate motto.

introduction

Yes, it's a thin book

I've worked hard to keep this book short--hopefully short enough you can read it on a long plane ride. I did this for two reasons:

> If it's short, it's more likely to actually be used.6 I'm writing for the people who are in the trenches--the designers, the developers, the site producers, the project managers, the marketing people, and the people who sign the checks, and for the one-man-band people who are doing it all themselves. Usability isn't your life's work, and you don't have time for a long book.

Tagline
Welcome blurb

> You don't need to know everything. As with any field, there's a lot you could learn about usability. But unless you're a usability professional, there's a limit to how much is useful to learn.7

6 There's a good usability principle right there: if something requires a large investment of time--or looks like it will--it's less likely to be used.
7 I've always liked the passage in A Study in Scarlet where Dr. Watson is shocked to learn that Sherlock Holmes doesn't know that the earth travels around the sun. Given the finite capacity of the human brain, Holmes explains, he can't afford to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones: "What the deuce is it to me? You say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work."
[ 6]

read me first
I find that the most valuable contributions I make to each project always come from keeping just a few key usability principles in mind. I think there's a lot more leverage for most people in understanding these principles than in another laundry list of specific do's and don'ts. I've tried to boil down the few things I think everybody involved in building Web sites should know.

long time, long enough to know that there is no one "right" way to design Web sites. It's a complicated process and the real answer to most of the questions that people ask me is "It depends."8 But I do think that there are a few useful guiding principles it always helps to have in mind, and those are what I'm trying to convey. > Discussion of business models. If history has taught us anything, it's that Internet business models are like buses: If you miss one, all you have to do is wait a little while and another one will come along. I'm no expert when it comes to making money on the Web, and even if I were, whatever I had to say would probably be passé by the time you read it. > Predictions for the future of the Web. Your guess is as good as mine. The only thing I'm sure of is that (a) most of the predictions I hear are almost certainly wrong, and (b) the things that will turn out to be important will come as a surprise, even though in hindsight they'll seem perfectly obvious.
> Bad-mouthing of poorly designed sites. If you enjoy people poking fun at sites with obvious flaws, you're reading the wrong book. Designing, building, and maintaining a great Web site isn't easy. It's like golf: a handful of ways to get the ball in the hole, a million ways not to. Anyone who gets it even half right has my admiration.
8 Jared Spool and his usability consulting cohorts at User Interface Engineering (www.uie.com) even have "It depends" T-shirts.

introduction
As a result, you'll find that the sites I use as examples tend to be excellent sites with minor flaws. I think you can learn more from looking at good sites than bad ones. > Examples from all kinds of sites. Most of the examples in the book are from e-commerce sites, but the principles I'm describing apply just as well to my next-door neighbor's vanity page, your daughter's soccer team's site, or your company's intranet. Including illustrations from all the different genres would have resulted in a much larger--and less useful book.
Who's on first?
Throughout the book, I've tried to avoid constant references to "the user" and "users." This is partly because of the tedium factor, but also to try to get you to think about your own experience as a Web user while you're reading--something most of us tend to forget when we've got our Web design hats on. This has led to the following use of pronouns in this book: > "I" is me, the author. Sometimes it's me the usability professional ("I tell my
clients...") and sometimes it's me speaking as a Web user ("If I can't find a Search button..."), but it's always me. > "You" is you, the reader--someone who designs, builds, publishes, or pays the bills for a Web site. > "We" ("How we really use the Web") is all Web users, which includes "you" and "I." I may sidestep these rules occasionally, but hopefully the context will always make it clear who I'm talking about.

read me first
Is this trip really necessary?
I could recite some of the usual awe-inspiring statistics about how many umpteen gazillion dollars will be left on the table this year by sites that don't mind their usability P's and Q's. But given that you're already holding a book about usability in your hands, you probably don't need me to tell you that usability matters. You know from your own experience as a Web user that paying attention to usability means less frustration and more satisfaction for your visitors, and a better chance that you'll see them again. I think my wife put her finger on the essence of it better than any statistic I've seen:
If something is hard to use, I just
don't use it as much.
I hope this book will help you build a better site and--if you can skip a few design arguments--maybe even get home in time for dinner once in a while.

chapter
1
Don't make me think!
krug's first law of usability

Michael, why are the drapes open?
--kay corleone in the godfather, part ii
People often ask me:
"What's the most important thing I should do if I want to make sure my Web site is easy to use?" The answer is simple. It's not "Nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away," or "Speak the user's language," or even "Be consistent." It's...
"Don't make me think!"
I've been telling people for years that this is my first law of usability. And the more Web pages I look at, the more convinced I become. It's the overriding principle--the ultimate tie breaker when deciding whether something works or doesn't in a Web design. If you have room in your head for only one usability rule, make this the one.1 It means that as far as is humanly possible, when I look at a Web page it should be self-evident. Obvious. Self-explanatory. I should be able to "get it"--what it is and how to use it--without expending any effort thinking about it. Just how self-evident are we talking about? Well, self-evident enough, for instance, that your next door neighbor, who has no interest in the subject of your site and who barely knows how to use the Back button, could look at your site's Home page and say, "Oh, it's a _____." (With any luck, she'll say, "Oh, it's a _____. Neat." But that's another subject.)
1 Actually, there is a close contender: "Get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left." But that one gets its own chapter later.
[ 11 ]

chapter 1
Think of it this way: When I'm looking at a page that doesn't make me think, all the thought balloons over my head say things like "OK, there's the _____. And that's a _____. And there's the thing that I want."
NOT THINKING

OK. This looks like the product
categories...
Memory, Modems... There it is: Monitors.
Click

...and these are today's special deals.

[ 12 ]

don't make me think!

But when I'm looking at a page that makes me think, all the thought balloons over my head have question marks in them.
THINKING

Hmm. Pretty busy. Where should I start?
Hmm. Why did they call it that?
Can I click on that?

Is that the navigation? Or is that it over there?
Why did they put that there?
Those two links seem like they're the same thing. Are they really?

When you're creating a site, your job is to get rid of the question marks.

[ 13 ]

chapter 1

Things that make us think
All kinds of things on a Web page can make us stop and think unnecessarily. Take names of things, for example. Typical culprits are cute or clever names, marketinginduced names, company-specific names, and unfamiliar technical names.

For instance, suppose a friend tells me that XYZ Corp is looking to hire someone with my exact qualifications, so I head off to their Web site. As I scan the page for something to click, the name they've chosen for their job listings section makes a difference.

< OBVIOUS

REQUIRES THOUGHT >

Jobs! Click

Hmm. [Milliseconds of thought] Jobs. Click

Hmm. Could be Jobs. But it sounds like more than that. Should I click or keep looking?

Note that these things are always on a continuum somewhere between "Obvious to everybody" and "Truly obscure," and there are always tradeoffs involved.
For instance, "Jobs" may sound too undignified for XYZ Corp, or they may be locked into "Job-o-Rama" because of some complicated internal politics, or because that's what it's always been called in their company newsletter. My main point is that the tradeoffs should usually be skewed further in the direction of "Obvious" than we care to think.
Another needless source of question marks over people's heads is links and buttons that aren't obviously clickable. As a user, I should never have to devote a millisecond of thought to whether things are clickable--or not.

[ 14 ]

< OBVIOUSLY CLICKABLE

Hmm.

[Milliseconds of thought]

I guess that's a button.

Click

Click

don't make me think!
REQUIRES THOUGHT >
Hmm. Is that a button?
Results

You may be thinking, "Well, it doesn't take much effort to figure out whether something's clickable. If you point the cursor at it, it'll change from an arrow to a pointing hand. What's the big deal?"
The point is, when we're using the Web every question mark adds to our cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand. The distractions may be slight but they add up, and sometimes it doesn't take much to throw us.
And as a rule, people don't like to puzzle over how to do things. The fact that the people who built the site didn't care enough to make things obvious--and easy--can erode our confidence in the site and its publishers.

[ 15 ]

chapter 1

Another example: On most bookstore sites, before I search for a book I first have to think about how I want to search.2

MOST BOOKSTORE SITES

Let's see. "Quick Search." That must be the same as "Search," right?

Do I have to click on that drop-down menu thing?
All I know about the book is that it's by Tom Clancy. Is Clancy a keyword?
(What is a keyword, anyway?)

I guess I have to use the menu. Clicks on the arrow

"Title. Author. Keyword." OK. I want "Author." Clicks "Author"

Types "Tom Clancy" Clicks "Search"
Granted, most of this "mental chatter" takes place in a fraction of a second, but you can see that it's a pretty noisy process. Even something as apparently innocent as jazzing up a well-known name (from "Search" to "Quick Search") can generate another question mark.
2 This was still true when I checked about a year ago. Only now, in 2005, have most of them finally improved.
[ 16 ]

don't make me think!

Amazon.com, on the other hand, doesn't even mention the Author-Title-Keyword distinction. They just look at what you type and do whatever makes the most sense.

AMAZON.COM

OK. "Search books
for _____."

Types "Tom Clancy" Clicks "Go"
After all, why should I have to think about how I want to search? And even worse, why should I have to think about how the site's search engine wants me to phrase the question, as though it were some ornery troll guarding a bridge? ("You forgot to say `May I?'")
I could list dozens of other things that visitors to a site shouldn't spend their time thinking about, like:
> Where am I? > Where should I begin? > Where did they put _____? > What are the most important things on this page? > Why did they call it that?
But the last thing you need is another checklist to add to your stack of Web design checklists. The most important thing you can do is to just understand the basic principle of eliminating question marks. If you do, you'll begin to notice all the things that make you think while you're using the Web, and eventually you'll learn to recognize and avoid them in the pages you're building.

[ 17 ]

chapter 1
You can't make everything self-evident
Your goal should be for each page to be self-evident, so that just by looking at it the average user3 will know what it is and how to use it. Sometimes, though, particularly if you're doing something original or groundbreaking or something very complicated, you have to settle for self-explanatory. On a self-explanatory page, it takes a little thought to "get it"--but only a little. The appearance of things, their well-chosen names, the layout of the page, and the small amounts of carefully crafted text should all work together to create near-instantaneous recognition. If you can't make a page self-evident, you at least need to make it self-explanatory.
Why is this so important?
Oddly enough, not for the reason you usually hear cited:
On the Internet, the competition is always just one click away,
so if you frustrate users they'll head somewhere else.
This is sometimes true, but you'd be surprised at how long some people will tough it out at sites that frustrate them. Many people who encounter problems with a site tend to blame themselves and not the site.
3 The actual Average User is kept in a hermetically sealed vault at the International Bureau of Standards in Geneva. We'll get around to talking about the best way to think about the "average user" eventually.
[ 18 ]

don't make me think!
The fact is, your site may not have been that easy to find in the first place and visitors may not know of an alternative. The prospect of starting over isn't always that attractive. And there's also the "I've waited ten minutes for this bus already, so I may as well hang in a little longer" phenomenon. Besides, who's to say that the competition will be any less frustrating?
So why, then?
Making pages self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better. Using a site that doesn't make us think about unimportant things feels effortless, whereas puzzling over things that don't matter to us tends to sap our energy and enthusiasm--and time. But as you'll see in the next chapter when we examine how we really use the Web, the main reason why it's important not to make me think is that most people are going to spend far less time looking at the pages we design than we'd like to think. As a result, if Web pages are going to be effective, they have to work most of their magic at a glance. And the best way to do this is to create pages that are selfevident, or at least self-explanatory.

How we really use the Web
scanning, satisficing, and muddling through

Why are things always in the last place you look for them? Because you stop looking when you find them.
--children's riddle

In the past ten years i've spent a lot of time watching people use the Web, and the thing that has struck me most is the difference between how we think people use Web sites and how they actually use them.
When we're creating sites, we act as though people are going to pore over each page, reading our finely crafted text, figuring out how we've organized things, and weighing their options before deciding which link to click.
What they actually do most of the time (if we're lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they're looking for. There are usually large parts of the page that they don't even look at.
We're thinking "great literature" (or at least "product brochure"), while the user's reality is much closer to "billboard going by at 60 miles an hour."

WHAT WE DESIGN FOR... THE REALITY...

[Pause for reflection]
Finally, click on a carefully
chosen link

Look around feverishly for anything that
a) is interesting, or vaguely resembles what you're looking for, and
b) is clickable.
As soon as you find a halfway-decent match, click.
If it doesn't pan out, click the Back button and try again.

[ 21 ]

chapter 2
As you might imagine, it's a little more complicated than this, and it depends on the kind of page, what the user is trying to do, how much of a hurry she's in, and so on. But this simplistic view is much closer to reality than most of us imagine.
It makes sense that we picture a more rational, attentive user when we're designing pages. It's only natural to assume that everyone uses the Web the same way we do, and--like everyone else--we tend to think that our own behavior is much more orderly and sensible than it really is.
If you want to design effective Web pages, though, you have to learn to live with three facts about real-world Web use.
FACT OF LIFE #1:
We don't read pages. We scan them.
One of the very few well-documented facts about Web use is that people tend to spend very little time reading most Web pages.1 Instead, we scan (or skim) them, looking for words or phrases that catch our eye.
The exception, of course, is pages that contain documents like news stories, reports, or product descriptions. But even then, if the document is longer than a few paragraphs, we're likely to print it out because it's easier and faster to read on paper than on a screen.
Why do we scan? > We're usually in a hurry. Much of our Web use is motivated by the desire to
save time. As a result, Web users tend to act like sharks: They have to keep moving, or they'll die. We just don't have the time to read any more than necessary. > We know we don't need to read everything. On most pages, we're really only interested in a fraction of what's on the page. We're just looking for the bits that match our interests or the task at hand, and the rest of it is irrelevant. Scanning is how we find the relevant bits.
1 See Jakob Nielsen's October 1997 Alertbox column, "How Users Read on the Web" available at www.useit.com.
[ 22 ]

how we really use the web
> We're good at it. We've been scanning newspapers, magazines, and books all our lives to find the parts we're interested in, and we know that it works.
The net effect is a lot like Gary Larson's classic Far Side cartoon about the difference between what we say to dogs and what they hear. In the cartoon, the dog (named Ginger) appears to be listening intently as her owner gives her a serious talking-to about staying out of the garbage. But from the dog's point of view, all he's saying is "blah blah GINGER blah blah blah blah GINGER blah blah blah." What we see when we look at a Web page depends on what we have in mind, but it's usually just a fraction of what's on the page.
WHAT DESIGNERS BUILD... WHAT USERS SEE...
I want to buy a ticket.
How do I check my frequent flyer miles?
Like Ginger, we tend to focus on words and phrases that seem to match (a) the task at hand or (b) our current or ongoing personal interests. And of course, (c) the trigger words that are hardwired into our nervous systems, like "Free," Sale," and "Sex," and our own name.
[ 23 ]

chapter 2
FACT OF LIFE #2:
We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.
When we're designing pages, we tend to assume that users will scan the page, consider all of the available options, and choose the best one. In reality, though, most of the time we don't choose the best option--we choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing.2 As soon as we find a link that seems like it might lead to what we're looking for, there's a very good chance that we'll click it. I'd observed this behavior for years, but its significance wasn't really clear to me until I read Gary Klein's book Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions.3 Klein has spent many years studying naturalistic decision making: how people like firefighters, pilots, chessmasters, and nuclear power plant operators make high-stakes decisions in real settings with time pressure, vague goals, limited information, and changing conditions. Klein's team of observers went into their first study (of field commanders at fire scenes) with the generally accepted model of rational decision making: Faced with a problem, a person gathers information, identifies the possible solutions, and chooses the best one. They started with the hypothesis that because of the high stakes and extreme time pressure, fire captains would be able to compare only two options, an assumption they thought was conservative. As it turned out, the fire commanders didn't compare any options. They took the first reasonable plan that came to mind and did a quick mental test for problems. If they didn't find any, they had their plan of action.
2 Economist Herbert Simon coined the term (a cross between satisfying and sufficing) in Models of Man: Social and Rational (Wiley, 1957).
3 The MIT Press, 1998.
[ 24 ]

how we really use the web
So why don't Web users look for the best choice? > We're usually in a hurry. And as Klein points out, "Optimizing is hard, and
it takes a long time. Satisficing is more efficient." > There's not much of a penalty for guessing wrong. Unlike firefighting, the
penalty for guessing wrong on a Web site is usually only a click or two of the Back button, making satisficing an effective strategy. (The Back button is the most-used feature of Web browsers.) Of course, this assumes that pages load quickly; when they don't, we have to make our choices more carefully--just one of the many reasons why most Web users don't like slow-loading pages. > Weighing options may not improve our chances. On poorly designed sites, putting effort into making the best choice doesn't really help. You're usually better off going with your first guess and using the Back button if it doesn't work out. > Guessing is more fun. It's less work than weighing options, and if you guess right, it's faster. And it introduces an element of chance--the pleasant possibility of running into something surprising and good. Of course, this is not to say that users never weigh options before they click. It depends on things like their frame of mind, how pressed they are for time, and how much confidence they have in the site.

The Prince and the Pauper (Classics Illustrated)

chapter 2
FACT OF LIFE #3:
We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.
One of the things that becomes obvious as soon as you do any usability testing-- whether you're testing Web sites, software, or household appliances--is the extent to which people use things all the time without understanding how they work, or with completely wrong-headed ideas about how they work. Faced with any sort of technology, very few people take the time to read instructions. Instead, we forge ahead and muddle through, making up our own vaguely plausible stories about what we're doing and why it works. It often reminds me of the scene at the end of The Prince and the Pauper where the real prince discovers that the look-alike pauper has been using the Great Seal of England as a nutcracker in his absence. (It makes perfect sense--to him, the seal is just this great big, heavy chunk of metal.) And the fact is, we get things done that way. I've seen lots of people use software and Web sites effectively in ways that are nothing like what the designers intended.
[ 26 ]

how we really use the web
My favorite example is the people (and I've seen at least a dozen of them myself during user tests) who will type a site's entire URL in the Yahoo search box every time they want to go there--not just to find the site for the first time, but every time they want to go there, sometimes several times a day. If you ask them about it, it becomes clear that some of them think that Yahoo is the Internet, and that this is the way you use it.4
Most Web designers would be shocked if they knew how many people type URLs in Yahoo's search box.
And muddling through is not limited to beginners. Even technically savvy users often have surprising gaps in their understanding of how things work. (I wouldn't be surprised if even Bill Gates has some bits of technology in his life that he uses by muddling through.)
4 In the same vein, I've encountered many AOL users who clearly think that AOL is the Internet--good news for Yahoo and AOL.
[ 27 ]

chapter 2
Why does this happen? > It's not important to us. For most of us, it doesn't matter to us whether we
understand how things work, as long as we can use them. It's not for lack of intelligence, but for lack of caring. In the great scheme of things, it's just not important to us.5 > If we find something that works, we stick to it. Once we find something that works--no matter how badly--we tend not to look for a better way. We'll use a better way if we stumble across one, but we seldom look for one. It's always interesting to watch Web designers and developers observe their first usability test. The first time they see a user click on something completely inappropriate, they're surprised. (For instance, when the user ignores a nice big fat "Software" button in the navigation bar, saying something like, "Well, I'm looking for software, so I guess I'd click here on `Cheap Stuff' because cheap is always good.") The user may even find what he's looking for eventually, but by then the people watching don't know whether to be happy or not. The second time it happens, they're yelling "Just click on `Software'!" The third time, you can see them thinking: "Why are we even bothering?" And it's a good question: If people manage to muddle through so much, does it really matter whether they "get it"? The answer is that it matters a great deal because while muddling through may work sometimes, it tends to be inefficient and error-prone.
5 Web developers often have a particularly hard time understanding--or even believing--that people might feel this way, since they themselves are usually keenly interested in how things work.
[ 28 ]

how we really use the web
On the other hand, if users "get it": > There's a much better chance that they'll find what they're looking for, which is
good for them and for you. > There's a better chance that they'll understand the full range of what your site
has to offer--not just the parts that they stumble across. > You have a better chance of steering them to the parts of your site that you
want them to see. > They'll feel smarter and more in control when they're using your site, which
will bring them back. You can get away with a site that people muddle through only until someone builds one down the street that makes them feel smart.
If life gives you lemons...
By now you may be thinking (given this less than rosy picture of the Web audience and how they use the Web), "Why don't I just get a job at the local 7-11? At least there my efforts might be appreciated." So, what's a girl to do? I think the answer is simple: If your audience is going to act like you're designing billboards, then design great billboards.

Billboard Design 101
designing pages for scanning, not reading

If you / Don't know / Whose signs / These are You can't have / Driven very far / Burma-Shave
--sequence of billboards promoting shaving cream, circa 1935

Faced with the fact that your users are whizzing by, there are five important things you can do to make sure they see--and understand--as much of your site as possible:
> Create a clear visual hierarchy on each page > Take advantage of conventions > Break pages up into clearly defined areas > Make it obvious what's clickable > Minimize noise.

Create a clear visual hierarchy
One of the best ways to make a page easy to grasp in a hurry is to make sure that the appearance of the things on the page--all of the visual cues--clearly and accurately portray the relationships between the things on the page: which things are related, and which things are part of other things. In other words, each page should have a clear visual hierarchy.

Pages with a clear visual hierarchy have three traits:

> The more important something is, the more prominent it is. For instance, the most important headings are either larger, bolder, in a distinctive color, set off by more white space, or nearer the top of the page--or some combination of the above.

Very important
A little less important
Nowhere near as important

[ 31 ]

chapter 3

> Things that are related logically are also related visually. For instance, you can show that things are similar by grouping them together under a heading, displaying them in a similar visual style, or putting them all in a clearly defined area.

> Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what. For instance, a section heading ("Computer Books") would appear above the title of a particular book, visually encompassing the whole content area of the page, because the book is part of the section. And the title in turn would span the elements that describe the book.

Computer Books

There's nothing new about visual hierarchies. Every newspaper page, for instance, uses prominence, grouping, and nesting to give us useful information about the contents of the page before we read a word. This picture goes with this story because they're both spanned by this headline. This story is the most important because it has the biggest headline, the widest column, and a prominent position on the page.

The headline spanning these three columns makes it obvious that they're all part of the same story.

The size of this headline makes it clear at a glance that this is the most important story.

[ 32 ]

billboard design 101

We all parse visual hierarchies--online and on paper--every day, but it happens so quickly that the only time we're even vaguely aware that we're doing it is when we can't do it--when the visual cues (or absence of them) force us to think.

A good visual hierarchy saves us work by preprocessing the page for us, organizing and prioritizing its contents in a way that we can grasp almost instantly.

But when a page doesn't have a clear visual hierarchy--if everything looks equally important, for instance--we're reduced to the much slower process of scanning the page for revealing words and phrases, and then trying to form our own sense of what's important and how things are organized. It's a lot more work.

Besides, we want editorial guidance in Web sites, the same way we want it in other media. The publisher knows better than anyone which pieces of the site's content are most important, valuable, or popular, so why not identify them for me and save me the trouble?

Parsing a page with a visual hierarchy that's even slightly flawed--where a heading spans things that aren't part of it, for instance--is like reading a carelessly constructed sentence ("Bill put the cat on the table for a minute because it was a little wobbly.").

Even though we can usually figure out what the sentence is supposed to mean, it still throws us momentarily and forces us to think when we shouldn't have to.

This flawed visual hierarchy suggests that all of the sections of the site are part of the Computer Books section.

[ 33 ]

chapter 3
Conventions are your friends
At some point in our youth, without ever being taught, we all learned to read a newspaper. Not the words, but the conventions. We learned, for instance, that a phrase in very large type is usually a headline that summarizes the story underneath it, and that text underneath a picture is either a caption that tells me what it's a picture of, or--if it's in very small type--a photo credit that tells me who took the picture. We learned that knowing the various conventions of page layout and formatting made it easier and faster to scan a newspaper and find the stories we were interested in. And when we started traveling to other cities, we learned that all newspapers used the same conventions (with slight variations), so knowing the conventions made it easy to read any newspaper. Every publishing medium develops conventions and continues to refine them and develop new ones over time.1 The Web already has a lot of them, mostly derived from newspaper and magazine conventions, and new ones will continue to appear. All conventions start life as somebody's bright idea. If the idea works well enough, other sites imitate it and eventually enough people have seen it in enough places that it needs no explanation. This adoption process takes time, but it happens pretty quickly on the Internet, like everything else. For instance, enough people are now familiar with the convention of using a metaphorical shopping cart on e-commerce sites that it's safe for designers to use a shopping cart icon without labeling it "Shopping cart."
1 Consider the small semitransparent logos that began appearing in the corner of your TV screen a few years ago to tell you which network you're watching. They're everywhere now, but TV had been around for 50 years before they appeared at all.
[ 34 ]

billboard design 101

There are two important things to know about Web conventions:

> They're very useful. As a rule, conventions only become conventions if they work. Wellapplied conventions make it easier for users to go from site to site without expending a lot of effort figuring out how things work.

There's a reassuring sense of familiarity, for instance, in seeing a list of links to the sections of a site on a colored background down the left side of the page, even if it's sometimes accompanied by a tedious sense of déjà vu.

Conventions enable users to figure out a lot about a Web page, even if they can't understand a word of it.

> Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them. Faced with the prospect of using a convention, there's a great temptation for designers to reinvent the wheel instead, largely because they feel (not incorrectly) that they've been hired to do something new and different, and not the same old thing. (Not to mention the fact that praise from peers, awards, and high-profile job offers are rarely based on criteria like "best use of conventions.")

chapter 3

Sometimes time spent reinventing the wheel results in a revolutionary new rolling device. But sometimes it just amounts to time spent reinventing the wheel.

WHEEL

If you're not going to use an

existing Web convention, you

need to be sure that what you're

replacing it with either (a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there's no learning curve--so it's

Patent Pending 48,022 B.C., 42,639 B.C., 36,210 B.C., 31,887 B.C., 30,599 B.C., 28,714 B.C., 28,001, B.C., 19,711 B.C., 18,224 B.C., B.C., BC, 15,690 B.C., 15,689 B.C., 15,675 B.C., 15,674 B.C.

as good as a convention, or (b)

adds so much value that it's

worth a small learning curve. If you're going to innovate, you have to

understand the value of what you're replacing, and many designers tend to

underestimate just how much value conventions provide.

My recommendation: Innovate when you know you have a better idea (and everyone you show it to says "Wow!"), but take advantage of conventions when you don't.

Break up pages into clearly defined areas
Ideally, users should be able to play a version of Dick Clark's old game show $25,000 Pyramid with any well-designed Web page.2 Glancing around, they should be able to point at the different areas of the page and say, "Things I can do on this site!" "Links to today's top stories!" "Products this company sells!" "Things they're eager to sell me!" "Navigation to get to the rest of the site!"
Dividing the page into clearly defined areas is important because it allows users to decide quickly which areas of the page to focus on and which areas they can

2 Given a category like "Things a plumber uses," contestants would have to get their partners to guess the category by giving examples ("a wrench, a pipe cutter, pants that won't stay up...").

safely ignore. Several of the initial eye-tracking studies of Web page scanning suggest that users decide very quickly which parts of the page are likely to have useful information and then almost never look at the other parts--almost as though they weren't there.

Make it obvious what's clickable
Since a large part of what people are doing on the Web is looking for the next thing to click, it's important to make it obvious what's clickable and what's not.

For example, on Senator Orrin Hatch's Home page3 during his unsuccessful 2000 presidential bid, it wasn't clear whether everything was click-able, or nothing was. There were 18 links on the page, but only two of them invited you to click by their appearance: a large button labeled "Click here to contribute!" and an underlined text link ("full story").

The rest of the links were colored text. But the problem was that all of the text on the page was in color, so there was no way to distinguish the links at a glance.

It's not a disastrous flaw. I'm sure it didn't take most users long to just start clicking on things. But when you force users to think about something that should be mindless like what's clickable, you're squandering the limited reservoir of patience and goodwill that each user brings to a new site.

3 Orrin Hatch deserves at least a footnote in usability history, since he was--to the best of my knowledge--the first presidential candidate to make Web usability a campaign issue. In the first televised Republican candidates' debate of the 2000 campaign, he told George W. Bush, "I have to say, Governor, in contrast to [your Web site], it's easy to find everything on mine. [Chuckles.] It's pretty tough to use yours! Yours is not user-friendly." (His site was easier to use.)

### Taste Model
# SplitLease Taste Model

## Brand Essence
SplitLease is a housing marketplace for people who need flexible, medium-term stays. Not a hotel. Not a permanent lease. The sweet spot in between.

## Visual Personality
- Warm, not cold. Soft backgrounds, not stark white.
- Confident, not flashy. The product speaks through clarity, not decoration.
- Trustworthy, not corporate. Rounded corners, human language, real data.
- Premium-accessible. Feels high quality without feeling exclusive.

## Typography Philosophy
- Serif for personality (headlines, brand). Instrument Serif â€” elegant but approachable.
- Sans for clarity (body, UI). Outfit â€” geometric but warm.
- Mono for data/trust (prices, stats, badges). IBM Plex Mono â€” signals precision and reliability.

## Color Philosophy
- Warm neutrals as base (not gray, not white â€” warm off-whites and tans)
- Forest green as accent (trust, growth, stability â€” not startup blue)
- Amber for warnings/urgency (warm, not alarming)
- Red only for errors (never for CTAs or emphasis)

## Animation Philosophy
- Fast response, gentle settle. User actions feel instant (< 100ms acknowledgment) but transitions are smooth (300-500ms).
- Never bounce. Spring easing for interactive elements, ease-out for transitions.
- One signature animation per component â€” restraint over spectacle.

## Core Value: Relentless Personalization
The UI should adapt to who you are and where you are in your journey. Generic states are a failure. If we know something about the user, the UI should reflect it.

## Implementation Checklist

When building Split Lease interfaces, verify:

- [ ] Colors use CSS variables from this guide (no hardcoded hex values)
- [ ] Typography uses defined font sizes and weights
- [ ] Spacing follows the spacing scale
- [ ] Border radius uses defined tokens
- [ ] Shadows use defined shadow variables
- [ ] Transitions use defined timing and easing
- [ ] Z-index follows the defined scale
- [ ] Touch targets meet 48px minimum
- [ ] Focus states are visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences are respected
- [ ] Protocol components use ONLY protocol tokens (no green/yellow)

# PROPOSED COLOR REVISIONS

## Paula Scher Recommendations | February 3, 2026

> **STATUS**: PROPOSED - NOT YET IN PRODUCTION
>
> The following color adjustments are recommendations based on a comprehensive audit of the current palette. These changes require team review and approval before implementation.

---

## Rationale Summary

The current palette suffers from three primary issues:

1. **Purple Proliferation**: 10+ purple variants that are visually indistinguishable
2. **Missing Warmth**: No warm accent color to balance the cool purple
3. **Accessibility Gaps**: Several colors fail WCAG AA contrast requirements

---

## Proposed Primary Purple Family (Consolidated)

**Goal**: Reduce from 10+ purples to 5 distinct, purposeful variants.

| Variable | Current Value | Proposed Value | Change |
|----------|---------------|----------------|--------|
| `--primary-purple` | `#31135D` | `#31135D` | No change - excellent brand anchor |
| `--primary-purple-hover` | `#251047` | `#1E0D42` | Slightly darker for clearer differentiation |
| `--secondary-purple` | `rgb(109, 49, 194)` | `#6B35C9` | Warmer, more saturated for CTAs |
| `--secondary-purple-hover` | `rgb(140, 104, 238)` | `#5A2AAD` | **CRITICAL**: Darker hover, not lighter |
| `--selected-purple` | `rgb(79, 48, 151)` | `#7B4DBA` | Warmer, more distinct from secondary |

### Variables to ELIMINATE

| Variable | Current Value | Replacement |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `--primary-purple-dark` | `#1f0a3d` | Use `--primary-purple-hover` |
| `--text-purple` | `rgb(82, 31, 147)` | Use `--secondary-purple` |
| `--chat-purple` | `rgb(75, 71, 206)` | Use `--secondary-purple` for badges |
| `--accent-purple` | `rgb(140, 104, 238)` | Use new `--secondary-purple-hover` |

---

## Proposed Warm Accent Colors (NEW)

**Goal**: Add warmth and urgency to balance the cool purple palette.

```css
/* NEW: Warm Accent Colors */
--accent-gold: #D4A853;
--accent-gold-light: #F5E6C3;
--accent-gold-dark: #B8923F;

--accent-coral: #E85D4C;
--accent-coral-hover: #D64C3C;
--accent-coral-light: #FCE8E6;
```

### Usage Guidelines

| Color | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `--accent-gold` | Premium badges, highlights, "featured" indicators |
| `--accent-gold-light` | Callout backgrounds, promotional sections |
| `--accent-coral` | Hearts/favorites, urgency ("Limited Availability"), action items |
| `--accent-coral-hover` | Hover state for coral elements |

---

## Proposed Status Colors (WCAG AA Compliant)

**Goal**: Ensure all status colors meet accessibility requirements.

### Current Problems

| Color | Current Contrast | Required | Status |
|-------|------------------|----------|--------|
| `--success-green` (#4B47CE) | ~3.0:1 | 4.5:1 | FAIL |
| `--success-teal` (#4B47CE) | ~3.0:1 | 4.5:1 | FAIL |
| Warning | Not defined | - | MISSING |
| Error | Not defined at root | - | MISSING |

### Proposed Status Palette

```css
/* Success */
--status-success: #4B47CE;           /* Updated per requested palette */
--status-success-light: #E6F5EE;     /* Background for success states */
--status-success-text: #4B47CE;      /* Updated per requested palette */

/* Warning */
--status-warning: #C4841D;           /* 4.6:1 contrast - AA compliant */
--status-warning-light: #FDF4E3;     /* Background for warning states */
--status-warning-text: #92620E;      /* Text on light warning background */

/* Error */
--status-error: #C53030;             /* 6.1:1 contrast - AA compliant */
--status-error-light: #FDE8E8;       /* Background for error states */
--status-error-text: #9B2C2C;        /* Text on light error background */

/* Info (keep existing, add light variant) */
--status-info: #2563EB;              /* Standardized info blue */
--status-info-light: #EFF6FF;        /* Background for info states */
```

---

## Proposed Text Color Adjustments

**Goal**: Improve contrast for secondary and tertiary text.

| Variable | Current | Proposed | Contrast on White |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------------|
| `--text-dark` | `#1a1a1a` | `#1a1a1a` | 16.1:1 (no change) |
| `--text-gray` | `#6b7280` | `#5A6370` | 5.9:1 (improved from 4.6:1) |
| `--text-light-gray` | `#9ca3af` | `#8891A0` | 4.5:1 (improved from 2.6:1) |
| `--text-placeholder` | (new) | `#A8B0BC` | 3.2:1 (for placeholder only) |

---

## Proposed Border Consolidation

**Goal**: Reduce from 5 border colors to 3.

### Current Border Chaos

```css
/* Current - 5 redundant variables */
--border-color: #e5e7eb;
--border-light: #f3f4f6;
--border-gray: rgba(107, 107, 107, 0.7);
--border-gray-light: #e0e0e0;
--border-gray-lighter: #ddd;
```

### Proposed Border System

```css
/* Proposed - 3 purposeful variables */
--border-subtle: #F0F1F3;      /* Barely visible, section dividers */
--border-default: #E2E4E8;     /* Standard borders, cards, inputs */
--border-emphasis: #C8CBD0;    /* Strong borders, active states */
```

---

## Proposed Day Badge Colors

**Goal**: Unify day badges with brand purple instead of blue-leaning chat purple.

### Current (Disconnected from Brand)

```css
/* Current - blue-leaning */
--chat-purple: rgb(75, 71, 206);  /* Used for day badges */
```

### Proposed (Brand-Aligned)

```css
/* Day Badge States */
--day-badge-inactive-bg: #E8E5F0;      /* Purple-tinted gray */
--day-badge-inactive-text: #6B7280;    /* Muted text */
--day-badge-selected-bg: #6B35C9;      /* Brand CTA purple */
--day-badge-selected-text: #FFFFFF;    /* White for contrast */
--day-badge-hover-bg: #F3F0F8;         /* Subtle hover for inactive */
```

## Dark Mode Preparation

If implementing dark mode, use these mappings:

| Light Mode | Dark Mode | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| `--primary-purple` (#31135D) | `#9B7FD1` | Lightened for dark bg |
| `--secondary-purple` (#6B35C9) | `#A385E0` | Maintains saturation |
| `--bg-white` (#FFFFFF) | `#1A1625` | Deep purple-black |
| `--text-dark` (#1a1a1a) | `#F5F3F7` | Off-white with purple tint |
| `--accent-gold` (#D4A853) | `#E8C77B` | Desaturated for dark bg |
| `--accent-coral` (#E85D4C) | `#F07B6C` | Lighter for visibility |
| `--status-success` (#4B47CE) | `#4B47CE` | Brighter for dark bg |
| `--status-warning` (#C4841D) | `#FBBF24` | Brighter for dark bg |
| `--status-error` (#C53030) | `#F87171` | Brighter for dark bg |

## Comparison: Before & After

### Brand Palette Simplification

| Before (10+ purples) | After (5 purples) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| primary-purple | primary-purple |
| primary-purple-hover | primary-purple-hover |

If System 1 flags the new context as unfamiliar, suspicious, or incoherent with the prior phase, the host abandons before deliberate evaluation begins. The platform currently has no mechanism to ensure System 1 approval at these transitions. The result is that hosts who successfully completed the prior phase still drop off at the next one, not because the content is wrong, but because the first impression of the new context fails the automatic legitimacy check.",
      "solution": "Design every phase transition to pass System 1's automatic assessment before demanding System 2 engagement. This means: (1) The first 2 seconds of every new screen or interaction must signal continuity with the prior phase through visual consistency, familiar language, and explicit connection to what just happened. (2) Each transition should open with recognition, not instruction. Show the host what they already provided or accomplished before asking for new input. (3) Remove any element that would trigger System 1 threat detection: unexpected terminology, unfamiliar UI patterns, demands for information that feel premature. (4) Use the same vocabulary the host heard in the phone call or prior interaction.

Kahneman's ego depletion research shows that after exerting self-control in one task, people are less willing and less able to exert it in the next. The parole judge study demonstrates that depleted decision-makers default to denial. In the host journey, the equivalent of denial is abandonment or accepting bad defaults. The current design treats each phase as though the user arrives fresh. They do not. They arrive depleted from the prior phase.",

(2) Provide smart defaults that produce good outcomes when accepted without deliberation. The parole judge analogy: if the default is denial, depleted judges deny. If the default is approval with safeguards, depleted judges approve with safeguards. Make the default the right answer. (3) Allow saving and resuming. A depleted host who leaves should be able to return to exactly where they stopped, not restart the phase. (4) Front-load the hardest decisions in the journey when the host is least depleted, and place the easiest decisions last.

This creates a speed mismatch: the call felt fast and efficient, the platform feels slow and laborious.

If the host can say it in 7 seconds, they should be able to enter it in under 15 seconds. (2) Use input patterns that mirror conversational flow: structured but not rigid. Quick-select chips, toggle switches, and pre-populated suggestions are faster than dropdown menus and text fields.

      "solution": "Explicitly prime the digital experience from within the human interaction, and design the digital experience to echo the human interaction. This requires two-directional bridging: (1) During the phone call, the agent should mention the platform by name, describe what the host will see ('I will send you a link, and when you open it you will see your two apartments already started for you'), and frame the platform as a continuation of the conversation, not a separate thing. (2) On the platform side, the first screen the host sees should reference the call: the agent's name, the properties discussed, the terms mentioned. The platform should feel like opening a letter from someone you just spoke with, not like landing on a stranger's website. (3) Use the agent's name and photo on the platform. If Bryant is the host's contact, Bryant's face should appear on the dashboard. The platform inherits trust from the person. (4) The first email or message from the platform should come FROM the agent (or appear to), not from 'noreply@splitlease.com.'",

When Drew transitions to the platform, every new screen demands interpretation: 'Where am I? What do I do here? Is this the thing Bryant told me about?' Krug's First Law states that pages must be self-evident â€” a user should 'get it' without expending any effort thinking about it. But the platform has no mechanism to ensure that each phase entry point passes this self-evidence test. Drew will not read instructions (Krug Ch. 2: 'very few people take the time to read instructions'). He will scan, form a vaguely plausible story about what he sees, and act on it. If the first screen of any phase makes him think â€” even for a millisecond â€” he has encountered a question mark that the phone call never produced.

'Why am I here?' â€” without requiring the user to read body text or instructions. (2) Use the $25,000 Pyramid test (Krug Ch. 3): a user should be able to point at clearly defined areas and name them ('My listing details,' 'Guests interested in my place,' 'What I'll earn'). (3) The page title or primary heading must use language Drew already heard in the call â€” not platform jargon. If Bryant said 'Ariel and Amber are interested in your space,' the proposal page heading should echo that framing, not say 'Incoming Proposals (2).'

Sounds good.'), the next steps (05:50: 'Sounds good.'). Krug Ch. 2 establishes that users 'don't choose the best option â€” we choose the first reasonable option.' On the platform, this means Drew will accept defaults without examining them. If the listing wizard pre-populates a nightly rate derived from $2,000/month but rounds incorrectly, Drew will accept it. If the proposal page pre-selects a counter-offer template that doesn't match what Bryant discussed, Drew will accept it. Satisficing is efficient and correct when defaults are right. It produces silent errors when defaults are wrong. The danger is not dropout â€” it's a host who publishes a listing or accepts a proposal with incorrect terms because the defaults were close enough to not trigger scrutiny.",
      "solution": "Make every default the right answer for a satisficing user. (1) Pre-populate all fields with data already known from the phone call and prior phases. Drew's rent is $2,000/month â€” this should already be the default, not a blank field. His deposit is $1,000 â€” pre-filled. His listing title is 'comfortable one bed, one bath' â€” pre-filled from the agent's notes. (2) When defaults require derivation (e.g., nightly rate from monthly rent), show the derivation transparently: '$67/night (based on your $2,000/month rent).' If Drew is satisficing, at least he can verify the math at a glance. (3) For consequential decisions (lease terms, cancellation policies), use Krug's convention of making the recommended option visually prominent and labeling it as recommended â€” not just listing options equally. (4) Eliminate optional fields that create micro-decisions. Every 'optional' field is a satisficing trap: Drew will either skip it (potentially missing something important) or fill it mindlessly (adding noise).

But there's a cost to making Drew re-decide things he's already decided: it introduces question marks ('Wait, should I reconsider? Is $2,000 still right?

He never front-loads the guarantee before the guest context, never mentions lease terms before Drew accepts the guests conceptually.

Drew's call has implicit 'clickability' â€” every question Bryant asks is an invitation to respond (a verbal affordance). 'Is that right?' is clickable. 'I can get back to you' is informational. The distinction is always obvious. On the platform, the distinction between interactive and informational elements is often ambiguous: text links look like headings, buttons look like labels, cards look like they might be clickable but aren't. Each ambiguity is a micro question mark. Drew, as a satisficing scanner, will click the first thing that looks clickable â€” and if that thing is actually a label or a section heading styled like a link, Drew has been misdirected. The information architecture must define clickability as an information signal: interactive elements signal 'you can act here,' and informational elements signal 'you can read here.' The two signals must never be confused.",
      "solution": "Establish a strict clickability vocabulary in the information architecture: (1) Interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) use a consistent visual language â€” a specific color, a specific shape (rounded rectangle for buttons, underline for links), and a specific position (action areas only, not embedded in body text unless clearly styled as links). (2) Informational elements (headings, labels, body text, data displays) use a different visual language â€” no underlines, no button shapes, no hover effects. (3) The clickability signal must be unambiguous even without color (for accessibility) â€” interactive elements should be distinguishable by shape, position, and typography alone. (4) Cards and tiles must either be entirely clickable (with a clear hover state and cursor change) or entirely informational (with no hover state). Half-clickable cards (where clicking the title opens details but clicking the body does nothing) create maximum ambiguity.

The guests (Ariel and Amber) were accepted during the call. The term (4 months with extension) was agreed in 14 seconds. Yet the platform's information architecture treats these as open decisions: editable fields, option selectors, multi-step wizards. This architectural mismatch has an information design consequence: the page communicates 'you need to decide something' when it should communicate 'here's what was agreed â€” confirm it.' The information hierarchy is wrong: open-decision pages put options first and confirmation second. Pre-decided pages should put the agreed outcome first and editing second. Krug Ch. 2: 'Weighing options may not improve our chances... You're usually better off going with your first guess.' Drew's 'first guess' is what Bryant already told him. The information architecture should reinforce this, not undermine it.",
      "solution": "Create a distinct information architecture pattern for pre-decided outcomes versus genuine decisions.

Place an 'Edit' or 'Change' link in Tier 3 â€” available but not competing for attention. The visual language should communicate 'this is settled' â€” calm, clean, no active form elements. (2) Genuine decision pattern: Present options with visual differentiation, recommended default highlighted, comparison supported. Action buttons offer real choices (Option A / Option B). The visual language should communicate 'you need to choose' â€” active form elements, contrasting options. (3) The information architecture must classify every platform interaction as either confirmation or decision during the design phase. The classification should be based on what was discussed in the agent call. If the agent covered it, it's a confirmation. If it's new to the host, it's a decision.

Drew's call embodies this: Bryant breaks the conversation into a series of single-topic exchanges (property confirmation â†’ availability â†’ guests â†’ guarantee â†’ photos â†’ terms), each requiring a single, simple response from Drew. The platform's listing wizard, by contrast, presents multi-field forms with interdependent options. 'Lease style' requires understanding the difference between nightly, weekly, and monthly â€” a complex choice. 'Amenities' presents a checklist of 20+ items â€” a combinatorial choice. 'Pricing' may ask for base rate plus cleaning fee plus security deposit â€” a multi-variable choice. Each complex choice slows Drew's scanning and forces System 2 engagement. Krug's insight is that breaking complex choices into sequences of simple ones eliminates the cognitive burden of holding multiple variables in working memory simultaneously.",
      "solution": "Decompose every multi-variable decision into a sequence of binary or near-binary choices. (1) For lease style: instead of presenting 3+ options with paragraphs of explanation, ask one question at a time. 'Do guests stay overnight? [Yes / No]' â†’ if Yes: 'How often? [A few nights a week / Full time]' â†’ derive lease style from answers. Drew never sees the word 'lease style.' (2) For amenities: instead of a 20-item checklist, show the 5 most common amenities as pre-selected defaults and ask 'Anything else?' with an expandable list. Drew confirms 5 defaults in 2 seconds instead of evaluating 20 checkboxes. (3) For pricing: show the pre-populated monthly rate and ask 'Is this right? [Yes / Change it].' No multi-field calculator. (4) The information architecture principle is: each screen presents one choice with 2-3 options. The cumulative effect of simple sequential choices is the same outcome as one complex multi-field form, but with dramatically lower cognitive cost per step.",
