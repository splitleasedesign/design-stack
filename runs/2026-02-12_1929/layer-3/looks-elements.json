      "problem": "Drew confirmed all essential listing details (1BR/1BA Chelsea, $2000/month, $1000 deposit) in 18 seconds of rapid conversation with immediate acknowledgments from Bryant ('Yep', 'Got it', 'Okay'). When hosts transition to the platform, they expect the same rapid feedback loop. Traditional form interfaces provide no visual confirmation until submission, creating a speed perception gap where the platform feels slower than conversation despite potentially being faster in total time.",
      "solution": "Design immediate visual acknowledgment that matches conversational confirmation speed. Use real-time visual feedback for each input: green check marks for completed fields, live preview updates as the host types, progress indicators that advance with each input. Typography should emphasize speed through quick visual scanning: use the platform's mono font (IBM Plex Mono) for data confirmation to signal precision and reliability. Color changes should happen within 100ms of input to match conversational response time.",

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_mgmt", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Drew demonstrated immediate accommodation ('Four months and then maybe the ability to extend. Okay. Okay. Sounds good.') using collaborative language. Platform proposal interfaces typically present binary options with equal visual weight (Approve/Decline buttons of identical size and color). This visual equality suggests that rejection is as appropriate as accommodation, contradicting the collaborative tone that makes accommodating hosts valuable.",
      "solution": "Use typographic hierarchy to make accommodation feel natural and prominent. Primary accommodation responses should use the platform's serif font (Instrument Serif) at larger sizes to convey personality and warmth. Rejection options should use sans-serif at smaller sizes. Color hierarchy should emphasize accommodation: use the warm accent color for positive responses, neutral colors for alternatives. Button sizing should reflect preference: accommodation actions larger than rejection actions.",
