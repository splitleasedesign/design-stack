      "problem": "When Drew transitions from the phone call to the platform, his System 1 must instantly assess whether this digital environment is the continuation of his conversation with Bryant or something entirely new. Traditional platform onboarding opens with instructions ('Welcome! Let's create your listing') rather than recognition ('Here's the Chelsea apartment you discussed with Bryant'). This creates a cognitive gap where the host must mentally bridge the conversation context to the platform context. Krug's research shows that users spend far less time reading than designers expect, so platforms have only seconds to establish continuity before the host's attention moves elsewhere.",
      "solution": "Structure information hierarchy to prioritize recognition over instruction at every phase entry point. The first information the host sees should acknowledge what they already did or provided, then guide toward what comes next. This means: (1) Lead with context, not action: 'Your Chelsea 1BR apartment' before 'Complete your listing'. (2) Reference the conversation: 'As discussed with Bryant' or 'Your $2000/month space'. (3) Show progress made: 'Property details confirmed' before 'Add photos'. (4) Use the host's own words from the call as headings and labels rather than platform terminology.",

      "problem": "Drew's phone call demonstrated information efficiency - he confirmed property details, pricing, and availability within 60 seconds of conversation. The platform must communicate that it operates at equal or superior efficiency, but traditional web hierarchies emphasize completeness over speed. When hosts see lengthy forms, multi-step wizards, or detailed field requirements, their System 1 assessment is that the platform will be slower than the conversation they just had. This perception, formed within seconds of the first platform interaction, becomes difficult to overcome even if the actual process is reasonably fast.",
      "solution": "Structure information architecture to signal speed and efficiency through visual hierarchy and progressive disclosure. Essential information should be visually prominent and instantly actionable, while comprehensive options remain accessible but secondary. This means: (1) Lead with the fastest path: one-line property entry before detailed form. (2) Show time estimates: 'Complete in under 2 minutes' prominently displayed. (3) Minimize visible fields initially: show only what Drew provided verbally, expand only when needed. (4) Use action-oriented rather than form-oriented language: 'Publish your Chelsea listing' not 'Complete listing form'.",

      "problem": "Drew demonstrated immediate accommodation behavior - agreeing to 4-month terms and extension possibilities without hesitation. Traditional platform interfaces for proposal management emphasize control and finality (Approve/Decline buttons), which doesn't match the collaborative, flexible communication style that makes hosts like Drew valuable. The information hierarchy suggests that decisions are binary and permanent, when accommodating hosts think in terms of flexibility and options. This architectural mismatch discourages the very behavior (accommodation) that drives guest satisfaction.",
      "solution": "Structure proposal and lease management interfaces to make accommodation the visually prominent and easiest response option. This means: (1) Replace binary decision hierarchies with collaborative response hierarchies. (2) Make flexibility options more prominent than rigid options: 'I can make that work' appears larger than 'Decline'. (3) Group accommodation tools visually: counter-offers, partial acceptance, and alternative suggestions clustered together. (4) Show accommodation history to reinforce this behavior pattern. (5) Use collaborative language in headers: 'Work together on lease terms' not 'Review proposal'.",
