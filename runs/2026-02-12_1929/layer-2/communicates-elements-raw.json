      "problem": "Drew scans Bryant's verbal output and extracts only what matters — price ($2,000), guests (Ariel and Amber), timeline (4 months) — ignoring everything else. Krug Ch. 2 confirms this is universal: 'What they actually do most of the time (if we're lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link that catches their interest.' The platform's phase entry screens currently treat all information as equally important — property details, system statuses, navigation labels, and action buttons share visual weight. When Drew arrives at any screen, his eye needs to land on the ONE thing that tells him 'this is what this page is about and this is what you do here.' If no element claims dominance, Drew must read instead of scan — which he will not do. He will either click something wrong (satisficing) or text Bryant (abandoning the platform).",
      "solution": "Structure every phase entry screen as a three-tier billboard hierarchy: (1) TIER 1 — The Anchor: A single primary element that answers 'What is this page about?' in Drew's language. This must be the largest, boldest element on the page. For proposals: 'Ariel & Amber want your Chelsea apartment.' For pricing: '$2,000/month — your rent.' For active lease: 'Ariel is staying through June.' (2) TIER 2 — The Decision: The primary action Drew needs to take, presented as a single prominent button or confirmation element directly below the anchor. For proposals: 'Accept this proposal.' For pricing: 'Confirm your rate.' (3) TIER 3 — The Details: Supporting information (fee breakdowns, lease terms, guest employment details) collapsed below the fold or in expandable sections. Drew can access it if he wants, but the billboard works without it. This hierarchy must be enforced through visual weight: Tier 1 gets 40% of visual attention (size, position, contrast), Tier 2 gets 35% (button prominence, whitespace isolation), Tier 3 gets 25% (smaller type, muted color, below fold).",

He never front-loads the guarantee before the guest context, never mentions lease terms before Drew accepts the guests conceptually. This sequencing is not accidental — it follows Drew's decision tree. Drew cannot evaluate a guarantee until he knows who the guests are. He cannot agree to terms until he trusts the guarantee. Each piece of information prepares the ground for the next. On the platform, this natural sequencing is destroyed. Dashboard pages show everything at once: property stats, pending proposals, payment history, messages, lease status. This forces Drew to parse a visual field with no inherent decision sequence — the information equivalent of reading a dictionary instead of a story.",
      "solution": "Structure information disclosure around the host's decision tree, not the platform's data model. (1) Define the host's decision sequence for each phase. For proposal review: 'Who are these guests?' → 'What do they want?' → 'What do I earn?' → 'Should I accept?' Each question maps to a disclosure stage. (2) Present information in decision-tree order: the answer to question 1 is immediately visible; the answer to question 2 is visible only after question 1 is answered (or acknowledged via scroll/click); question 3 follows from question 2. (3) Use spatial sequencing (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) to enforce the decision tree. The most upstream question lives at the top of the page. Downstream questions live below. (4) For the listing wizard, apply the same principle across steps: Step 1 (space basics) answers 'What is this place?' Step 2 (features) answers 'What's special about it?' Step 3 (pricing) answers 'What will I earn?' Each step's disclosure is gated on the prior step's completion.

Drew's call has implicit 'clickability' — every question Bryant asks is an invitation to respond (a verbal affordance). 'Is that right?' is clickable. 'I can get back to you' is informational. The distinction is always obvious. On the platform, the distinction between interactive and informational elements is often ambiguous: text links look like headings, buttons look like labels, cards look like they might be clickable but aren't. Each ambiguity is a micro question mark. Drew, as a satisficing scanner, will click the first thing that looks clickable — and if that thing is actually a label or a section heading styled like a link, Drew has been misdirected. The information architecture must define clickability as an information signal: interactive elements signal 'you can act here,' and informational elements signal 'you can read here.' The two signals must never be confused.",

(2) Informational elements (headings, labels, body text, data displays) use a different visual language — no underlines, no button shapes, no hover effects. (3) The clickability signal must be unambiguous even without color (for accessibility) — interactive elements should be distinguishable by shape, position, and typography alone. (4) Cards and tiles must either be entirely clickable (with a clear hover state and cursor change) or entirely informational (with no hover state). Half-clickable cards (where clicking the title opens details but clicking the body does nothing) create maximum ambiguity.

      "problem": "Drew's call reveals that most 'decisions' on the platform are actually confirmations of decisions already made. The price ($2,000/month) was decided before the call. The guests (Ariel and Amber) were accepted during the call. The term (4 months with extension) was agreed in 14 seconds. Yet the platform's information architecture treats these as open decisions: editable fields, option selectors, multi-step wizards. This architectural mismatch has an information design consequence: the page communicates 'you need to decide something' when it should communicate 'here's what was agreed — confirm it.' The information hierarchy is wrong: open-decision pages put options first and confirmation second. Pre-decided pages should put the agreed outcome first and editing second. Krug Ch. 2: 'Weighing options may not improve our chances... You're usually better off going with your first guess.' Drew's 'first guess' is what Bryant already told him. The information architecture should reinforce this, not undermine it.",
      "solution": "Create a distinct information architecture pattern for pre-decided outcomes versus genuine decisions. (1) Pre-decided pattern: Present information as a summary statement ('$2,000/month, 4 months, starting March'), not as editable fields. Place a single 'Confirm' button below the summary. Place an 'Edit' or 'Change' link in Tier 3 — available but not competing for attention. The visual language should communicate 'this is settled' — calm, clean, no active form elements. (2) Genuine decision pattern: Present options with visual differentiation, recommended default highlighted, comparison supported. Action buttons offer real choices (Option A / Option B). The visual language should communicate 'you need to choose' — active form elements, contrasting options. (3) The information architecture must classify every platform interaction as either confirmation or decision during the design phase. The classification should be based on what was discussed in the agent call. If the agent covered it, it's a confirmation. If it's new to the host, it's a decision. (4) The confirmation pattern should feel like signing a letter, not filling out a form.",

      "problem": "Krug Ch. 4 introduces the principle that 'users like mindless choices' — given the option between one complex choice and three simple sequential choices, users prefer the simple ones. Drew's call embodies this: Bryant breaks the conversation into a series of single-topic exchanges (property confirmation → availability → guests → guarantee → photos → terms), each requiring a single, simple response from Drew. The platform's listing wizard, by contrast, presents multi-field forms with interdependent options. 'Lease style' requires understanding the difference between nightly, weekly, and monthly — a complex choice. 'Amenities' presents a checklist of 20+ items — a combinatorial choice. 'Pricing' may ask for base rate plus cleaning fee plus security deposit — a multi-variable choice. Each complex choice slows Drew's scanning and forces System 2 engagement. Krug's insight is that breaking complex choices into sequences of simple ones eliminates the cognitive burden of holding multiple variables in working memory simultaneously.",
      "solution": "Decompose every multi-variable decision into a sequence of binary or near-binary choices. (1) For lease style: instead of presenting 3+ options with paragraphs of explanation, ask one question at a time. 'Do guests stay overnight? [Yes / No]' → if Yes: 'How often? [A few nights a week / Full time]' → derive lease style from answers. Drew never sees the word 'lease style.' (2) For amenities: instead of a 20-item checklist, show the 5 most common amenities as pre-selected defaults and ask 'Anything else?' with an expandable list. Drew confirms 5 defaults in 2 seconds instead of evaluating 20 checkboxes. (3) For pricing: show the pre-populated monthly rate and ask 'Is this right? [Yes / Change it].' No multi-field calculator. (4) The information architecture principle is: each screen presents one choice with 2-3 options. The cumulative effect of simple sequential choices is the same outcome as one complex multi-field form, but with dramatically lower cognitive cost per step.",
