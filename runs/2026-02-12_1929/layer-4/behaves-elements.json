      "problem": "Drew's phone call operated at natural conversational speed with immediate acknowledgments ('Yep', 'Got it', 'Okay') happening within 200-500ms of his statements. When hosts transition to the platform, they expect similar response immediacy. Traditional web interfaces have loading states, form validation delays, and multi-second page transitions that feel sluggish compared to conversation. This response time gap makes the platform feel inferior to human interaction.",
      "solution": "Design all platform interactions to respond within conversational timing windows. Form inputs should acknowledge within 100ms, confirmations within 300ms, and page transitions within 800ms. Use optimistic UI patterns: show success immediately, handle failures gracefully in background.",

      "problem": "Drew demonstrated immediate accommodation behavior without deliberation ('Four months and then maybe the ability to extend. Okay. Okay. Sounds good.'). Traditional interfaces present approval and rejection as equal options, forcing accommodating hosts to actively choose accommodation when it should be their natural default response.",
