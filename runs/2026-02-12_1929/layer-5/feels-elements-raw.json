      "journey_phases": ["onboarding", "listing_creation"],
      "problem": "Drew's call with Bryant is effortless — six minutes of conversational flow where Drew never struggles, never hesitates, never asks 'what do I do?' The call ends with Drew in a state of easy momentum: 'Sounds good. Okay. No, that'll be all... let me just send you pictures and, um, can we maybe move on?' This momentum is fragile. The moment Drew clicks Bryant's follow-up link and encounters a platform that looks, feels, or speaks differently from the call, the effortless feeling shatters. The emotional challenge is not confusion — it's the jarring shift from 'someone is taking care of this for me' to 'now I have to figure this out alone.' Krug's First Law ('Don't make me think!') is fundamentally an emotional principle: thinking feels like work, and work feels like friction, and friction feels like the platform doesn't respect Drew's time. The call set an emotional baseline of zero friction. Every millisecond of thinking the platform demands is felt as a betrayal of that baseline.",
      "solution": "The platform's first screen must emotionally feel like opening a note from Bryant, not like logging into a new system. The tonal principle is: continue the conversation, don't start a new one. Every piece of copy, every layout choice, every interaction on the first three screens must sustain the feeling that Drew is still in Bryant's care — that the platform is Bryant's tool, not a separate entity. The emotional target is the feeling you get when a friend texts you a link and you open it to find exactly what they described: recognition, not discovery. Achievement of this requires: (1) Using Bryant's name and voice in platform copy. (2) Showing Drew information he already knows (his apartment, the guests Bryant mentioned) before asking for anything new. (3) Making the first action a confirmation, not a creation — 'Is this your place?' not 'Create your listing.'",

          "insight": "Drew's closing tone is impatient-but-positive — he wants momentum, not explanation. The word 'move on' reveals his emotional state: he considers the conversation handled and wants the next step to be equally fast. The platform must match this 'moving on' energy, not reset it to 'getting started' energy."

      "problem": "Drew is an efficient communicator who values brevity. His call responses are minimal: 'Yep. Yep.' (00:49-00:52), 'Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright.' (04:18), 'Sounds good.' (05:32, 05:50). This is not passivity — it's competence. Drew processes information quickly and signals acceptance concisely. He expects the platform to match this competence: show him what matters, let him confirm, move on. When a platform page requires reading, scrolling, interpreting, or deliberating, it communicates that the platform is less competent than Bryant. Bryant could cover a topic in 15 seconds of speech. If the platform takes 2 minutes of form-filling for the same topic, the emotional message is: 'this tool is slower than a phone call.' The host doesn't feel frustrated in the traditional sense — he feels that his time is being disrespected. Krug Ch. 2 says users scan like billboards at 60 mph. The emotional corollary is: when a billboard is clear, you feel smart. When it's cluttered, you feel lost. Drew should feel smart at every scan.",
      "solution": "Design every screen to make Drew feel like the competent, efficient person he is. The tonal principle is: respect the host's intelligence by not over-explaining. Every page should communicate its purpose in Drew's scanning speed — which is faster than most users because Drew satisfices aggressively. Copy should be short, factual, and free of persuasion (Drew is already persuaded). Forms should be pre-filled (Drew shouldn't re-enter what Bryant already knows). Actions should be one-click (Drew decides fast). The emotional signal at every interaction should be: 'We know you're busy. Here's what you need. Confirm and move on.'",

The emotional state is calm certainty: 'I get paid no matter what.' On the platform, every financial touchpoint risks disrupting this calm: pricing forms with editable fields suggest the number might be wrong; payment status pages with pending/processing labels suggest the payment might not arrive; fee breakdowns reveal deductions Drew didn't discuss with Bryant.

The emotional risk of a multi-step flow is not that any single step is hard — it's that the host doesn't know when it ends.

(2) Time-aware greetings that reference the current state of Drew's lease: 'Ariel is in month 3 of 4' not 'Active Lease.' (3) Proactive surfacing of the most likely reason Drew is visiting: if a payment was just deposited, show it prominently; if a renewal decision is approaching, surface it.

The emotional risk is that the renewal prompt triggers re-evaluation: 'Should I continue? Was this worth it? What are my alternatives?' Krug Ch. 1 warns that 'puzzling over things that don't matter to us tends to sap our energy and enthusiasm.' Re-evaluation is puzzling over something that, for a satisfied host, doesn't need to be puzzled over. The platform's renewal prompt must frame continuation as the natural default — not as a decision that requires weighing. Krug Ch. 2 supports this: 'There's also the \"I've waited ten minutes for this bus already, so I may as well hang in a little longer\" phenomenon.' Sunk cost works in the platform's favor, but only if the renewal prompt activates the sunk cost feeling rather than the re-evaluation feeling.",

(2) A single prominent 'Extend' button with one-click action — no forms, no term reconfiguration, no re-entering data. (3) Showing the positive trajectory: earnings graph, zero missed payments, guest satisfaction. The renewal prompt should feel like a paycheck stub, not a contract negotiation. (4) Timing the prompt 2-3 weeks before lease end — early enough to feel proactive, late enough that Drew has recent positive data to reference.
