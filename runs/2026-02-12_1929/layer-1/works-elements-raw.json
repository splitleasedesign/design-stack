      "problem": "Drew's entire evaluation happens through a 6-minute phone call where every topic is self-evident — Bryant asks, Drew answers, meaning arrives instantly. When Drew transitions to the platform, every new screen demands interpretation: 'Where am I? What do I do here? Is this the thing Bryant told me about?' Krug's First Law states that pages must be self-evident — a user should 'get it' without expending any effort thinking about it. But the platform has no mechanism to ensure that each phase entry point passes this self-evidence test. Drew will not read instructions (Krug Ch. 2: 'very few people take the time to read instructions'). He will scan, form a vaguely plausible story about what he sees, and act on it. If the first screen of any phase makes him think — even for a millisecond — he has encountered a question mark that the phone call never produced. Each question mark compounds across phases, eroding the trust Bryant built.",
      "solution": "Apply Krug's First Law as a gate for every phase entry: no phase should present its first screen until that screen passes the self-evidence test. Concretely: (1) Every phase entry screen must answer three questions within 2 seconds of visual scanning: 'What is this?' 'What can I do here?' 'Why am I here?' — without requiring the user to read body text or instructions. (2) Use the $25,000 Pyramid test (Krug Ch. 3): a user should be able to point at clearly defined areas and name them ('My listing details,' 'Guests interested in my place,' 'What I'll earn'). (3) The page title or primary heading must use language Drew already heard in the call — not platform jargon. If Bryant said 'Ariel and Amber are interested in your space,' the proposal page heading should echo that framing, not say 'Incoming Proposals (2).' (4) Eliminate every element that exists for the platform's benefit but adds a question mark for the host: tracking IDs, internal status labels, system-generated timestamps that mean nothing to Drew.",

      "problem": "Drew scans Bryant's verbal output the same way Krug says users scan web pages: he picks out the parts that matter (price, guests, timeline) and ignores the rest (company name, vetting process mechanics). In the call, Bryant covers the guarantee in 23 seconds (03:44-04:18), and Drew absorbs only the conclusion ('I still get paid'). On the platform, the equivalent information will be presented as text, tables, and forms that Drew must read — not scan. Krug Ch. 2 establishes that 'people tend to spend very little time reading most Web pages' and instead scan for 'words or phrases that catch our eye.' But platform decision points (listing wizard steps, pricing fields, proposal details) are typically designed for reading: dense forms, paragraph explanations, multi-option dropdowns. Drew will not read them. He will scan for trigger words ($2,000, Chelsea, Ariel, 4 months) and ignore everything else. If the trigger words are buried in body text or formatted identically to non-essential text, Drew will miss them.",
      "solution": "Restructure every decision point as a scannable billboard, not a readable document. Following Krug Ch. 3: (1) Create a clear visual hierarchy where the most important information (the thing Drew needs to decide) is the most visually prominent element on the page — larger, bolder, or in a distinctive color. (2) Use trigger words Drew already knows from the call as scannable anchors: '$2,000,' 'Chelsea,' 'Ariel & Amber,' '4 months.' These should be visually distinct, not embedded in sentences. (3) Break dense information into clearly defined areas that Drew can scan independently — Krug's '$25,000 Pyramid' principle. A proposal page should have visually distinct zones: 'Who' (guest photo + name), 'When' (dates), 'How much' (total), 'What to do' (Accept/Decline). (4) Use progressive disclosure: show the scannable summary first, and let Drew tap to expand details only if he wants them. Most of the time, he won't.",

Sounds good.'), the next steps (05:50: 'Sounds good.'). Krug Ch. 2 establishes that users 'don't choose the best option — we choose the first reasonable option.' On the platform, this means Drew will accept defaults without examining them. If the listing wizard pre-populates a nightly rate derived from $2,000/month but rounds incorrectly, Drew will accept it. If the proposal page pre-selects a counter-offer template that doesn't match what Bryant discussed, Drew will accept it. Satisficing is efficient and correct when defaults are right. It produces silent errors when defaults are wrong. The danger is not dropout — it's a host who publishes a listing or accepts a proposal with incorrect terms because the defaults were close enough to not trigger scrutiny.",
      "solution": "Make every default the right answer for a satisficing user. (1) Pre-populate all fields with data already known from the phone call and prior phases. Drew's rent is $2,000/month — this should already be the default, not a blank field. His deposit is $1,000 — pre-filled. His listing title is 'comfortable one bed, one bath' — pre-filled from the agent's notes. (2) When defaults require derivation (e.g., nightly rate from monthly rent), show the derivation transparently: '$67/night (based on your $2,000/month rent).' If Drew is satisficing, at least he can verify the math at a glance. (3) For consequential decisions (lease terms, cancellation policies), use Krug's convention of making the recommended option visually prominent and labeling it as recommended — not just listing options equally. (4) Eliminate optional fields that create micro-decisions. Every 'optional' field is a satisficing trap: Drew will either skip it (potentially missing something important) or fill it mindlessly (adding noise).

Krug Ch. 3 states that 'conventions only become conventions if they work' and that 'designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.' The Split Lease platform risks inventing new interaction patterns for processes Drew already knows how to do on other platforms. If Drew has listed on StreetEasy, he knows how a listing form works. If he's used Venmo, he knows how a payment confirmation looks. If he's used Airbnb, he knows how a booking request appears. Every deviation from these conventions adds a question mark. Krug warns: 'If you're not going to use an existing Web convention, you need to be sure that what you're replacing it with either (a) is so clear and self-explanatory that there's no learning curve, or (b) adds so much value that it's worth a small learning curve.' Most platform deviations meet neither threshold.",

(2) Pricing should follow banking/payment conventions — monthly amount, clear breakdowns, dollar signs, decimals. Not custom sliders or rate calculators. (3) Proposals should follow Airbnb booking request conventions — guest photo, dates, message, Accept/Decline buttons. Drew has seen this pattern. Use it. (4) Payment confirmations should follow Venmo/banking conventions — date, amount, status, from whom. (5) Only deviate from conventions when the Split Lease model genuinely requires it (e.g., the guarantee concept has no direct conventional analog) — and when you do deviate, make the new pattern so self-explanatory that it needs no learning curve.",

      "problem": "Drew's call reveals that many platform 'decisions' are actually pre-decided by the time Drew encounters the platform. The price is $2,000/month (decided before the call). The guests are Ariel and Amber (accepted during the call). The term is 4 months with extension (agreed during the call). The deposit is $1,000 (established). Yet the platform presents these as open decisions requiring multi-step interaction: a pricing wizard with blank or editable fields, a proposal review with Accept/Decline/Counter options and details to evaluate, a lease term configurator. Krug Ch. 2 explains why this is wasteful: 'There's not much of a penalty for guessing wrong on a Web site is usually only a click or two of the Back button, making satisficing an effective strategy.' But there's a cost to making Drew re-decide things he's already decided: it introduces question marks ('Wait, should I reconsider? Is $2,000 still right? Should I counter?') that the phone call already resolved. The platform is creating artificial decision points for decisions that are already made.",
      "solution": "When the outcome is pre-decided (by the phone call, by prior confirmation, by obvious context), reduce the interaction to a single confirmation click. (1) If Bryant already discussed pricing and Drew confirmed $2,000/month, the pricing step should show '$2,000/month — confirmed on your call with Bryant' and a single 'Confirm' button. Not a form. Not a wizard step. A confirmation. (2) If Drew already accepted Ariel and Amber during the call, the proposal should arrive as 'Ariel & Amber — 4 months starting early March — $2,000/month — Confirm this proposal' with a single prominent button. The Counter and Decline options can exist but should be visually subordinate — they are edge cases, not the primary path. (3) If the lease is approaching renewal and Drew has expressed interest in extending, the renewal prompt should be 'Extend for another 4 months? [Yes, extend]' — not a form asking Drew to re-specify terms. (4) Distinguish between genuine decisions (where the host needs to evaluate options) and ceremonial confirmations (where the host is rubber-stamping something already decided). Design each accordingly.",
