Several new tokens are proposed but not formally added to the token system. A dedicated looks-elements pass should be run with the explicit goal of reconciling the token systems.",
      "new_input": "The production style guide (Agents-data-source/Style-guide.md) should be treated as the canonical color reference. tokens.json should be updated to match. All looks-elements from this run and prior runs should be re-validated against the reconciled token system. Specifically: replace all references to --accent (#2d5a3d) with the production purple values, and add the 6 proposed semantic tokens."

      "layer": "1",
      "reason": "The discovery phase has only 2 elements across the entire library (both tangential). Drew's call starts post-discovery, so this lens cannot generate discovery elements. A future run should specifically target the discovery phase with a lens that includes a host who describes how they found Split Lease.",
      "new_input": "Select a host call where the host explicitly describes their discovery journey (how they heard about Split Lease, what they searched for, what ad or referral brought them). Pair with Krug Ch. 1-3 which directly address first-impression usability for landing pages and discovery touchpoints. This would extend the library's thinnest coverage area."

    {
      "layer": "5",
      "reason": "The retention emotional element (feels-007) is based on pre-lease speculation — Drew hasn't actually experienced the active lease or renewal phase. The emotional design for retention needs validation from a host who has been through the full cycle.",
      "new_input": "Select a host call with a returning or renewing host — someone who has completed at least one lease cycle and is discussing continuation. This would provide real behavioral evidence for the retention emotional arc (currently the weakest link in the emotional journey). The book lens could be Krug Ch. 10 (Usability as common courtesy) which addresses how cumulative experience shapes long-term user relationships."
    },
    {
      "layer": "4",
      "reason": "The behaves layer introduced 6 interaction patterns, but none address the active_lease phase's recurring interactions — checking payment status, communicating with guests through the platform, managing issues. These are the interactions that determine whether Drew uses the platform or defaults to texting Bryant during the longest phase of the journey.",
      "new_input": "Use the existing active_lease journey map to identify the 3-4 most common recurring interactions (payment status check, guest communication, issue reporting, maintenance scheduling) and design interaction patterns for each. The behavioral principle from this run — convention-matching to banking/Venmo patterns for payments, messaging app patterns for communication — should guide the patterns."
