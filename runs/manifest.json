Airbnb's upmarket migration into luxury vacation experiences created three structurally undefended vacuums: the relationship layer (no platform treats the host-guest bond as the product), the active-stay layer (zero management between booking and review), and the trust-formation layer (no cohabitation compatibility assessment). 11 disappointments identified, 4 with strong transcript validation (5+ transcripts each). 4 new discoveries including 'The Airbnb Burnout Exodus' — hosts actively fleeing Airbnb. 5 opportunities ranked, led by 'The Relationship-First Platform' (the person is the listing). 6 UI elements produced, all reinforcing existing library patterns. The Total Monthly Cost Badge achieved the strongest cross-process signal in the system: 5 independent lenses across 2 process types converge on it.",

For 3+ month leases (max 4 reviews/year), every Hook phase breaks. 12 disappointments identified across 4 clusters: The Broken Hook Cycle, The Mid-Stay Data Desert, The Reviewer Identity Vacuum, and The Long-Stay Relevance Gap. 68 transcripts scanned with 32 yielding matches; 7 strong validations including the Trust Desert (6 transcripts). 4 new discoveries: LinkedIn-as-trust-workaround, vetting-as-invisible-review, physical-verification demand, and Airbnb refugee trust loop. 5 opportunities ranked, led by 'The Stay-Cycle Review Heartbeat' — one-tap micro-reviews in the Stays Manager accumulating 13+ data points per lease. 7 UI elements produced. 7 cross-process reinforcements found, strongest being the Stays Manager convergence (design-stack via Kahneman + reverse-benchmark via Eyal independently identify it as foundational architecture). 1 productive contradiction (ego depletion vs habit formation) resolved into a two-layer system: high-frequency pulses + periodic syntheses.",
