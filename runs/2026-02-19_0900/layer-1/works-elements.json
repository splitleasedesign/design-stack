      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "pricing", "proposal_mgmt", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "Hosts are the hard side of Split Lease's network: they contribute disproportionate value (their property) and have disproportionately high expectations. Mahesh circles back to financial risk three separate times during a 13-minute call -- payment guarantee (02:17, 10:45), deposit handling (09:34), and property damage resolution (12:04). Each question is a probe for the same underlying concern: will I lose money? Cold Start Theory identifies that the hard side has 'complex workflows, expects status benefits as well as financial outcomes, and will try competitive products to compare.' Mahesh is already comparing to Furnished Finder (07:29). If Split Lease's risk absorption is perceived as partial -- 'we reduce risk' rather than 'we eliminate risk' -- Mahesh has no reason to switch from the known competitor to the unknown platform. The current journey surfaces guarantees reactively (only when the host asks) rather than proactively eliminating risk as a prerequisite to every commitment request.",
      "solution": "Structure every commitment-requesting moment in the journey so that the platform has already demonstrated complete risk absorption BEFORE the commitment is requested. This means: (1) At evaluation, surface the payment guarantee, host guarantee ($1M property damage coverage), and vetting process unprompted, before asking the host to proceed. Do not wait for the host to ask 'what if there's damage?' -- answer it before the question forms. (2) At pricing, show the guarantee inline with the rate confirmation: '$2,600/month -- guaranteed to you regardless of occupancy.' The guarantee is not a separate feature; it is embedded in the price display. (3) At proposal management, the proposal card should lead with risk-absorbed language: 'Vetted guest. Payment guaranteed. $1M property coverage active.' before showing guest details or asking for acceptance. (4) At active lease, the dashboard should show a persistent 'protection status' indicator so the host never has to wonder whether they are covered. The pattern: risk absorption must precede every ask, not follow it.",

      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "onboarding", "listing_creation", "proposal_mgmt"],
      "problem": "Mahesh cannot unilaterally join the Split Lease network. His management company requires an application for every guest (04:25-04:30: 'I probably need that information to share with my management because they do require application'). This creates a structural barrier that Cold Start Theory identifies as analogous to enterprise adoption: 'There are enterprise products like Workday that require the company to implement them before there's any value. Here, a viral growth strategy is difficult, because it's not enough to dribble in a few users at a time.' The atomic network for hosts with management companies is not [Host + Guest + Platform] but [Host + Management Company + Guest + Platform]. The current journey has no workflow, documentation format, or communication channel designed for this third-party gatekeeper. If the management company cannot process Split Lease's guest information through their existing application workflow, the atomic network never forms -- regardless of how convinced Mahesh personally is.",
      "solution": "Treat the management company as a network participant with its own onboarding path and information needs. This means: (1) During evaluation, ask the host whether a third-party approval is required. If yes, immediately branch into a gatekeeper-aware workflow. (2) Generate a 'Management Company Package' -- a PDF or shareable link containing the guest's vetted profile, credit check summary, employment verification, intended stay pattern, and Split Lease's guarantee terms, formatted to look like a standard rental application. The format should match what management companies expect, not what Split Lease's internal system generates. (3) During proposal management, add a 'Share with Management' action that sends the package directly to the management company contact with the host CC'd. (4) Track the management company's approval status as a visible pipeline stage: 'Awaiting Management Approval' appears between 'Proposal Sent' and 'Lease Ready.' (5) For hosts who successfully navigate the management company gate once, store the pathway so subsequent guests can be submitted through the same channel with minimal re-effort. This is Chen's domino effect applied to institutional adoption: the first approval creates a pathway that makes every subsequent approval easier.",

      "journey_phases": ["evaluation", "pricing", "active_lease"],
      "problem": "The ghost roommate concept is Split Lease's highest-leverage differentiator -- it can double the economic yield of a single property by filling weekday and weekend slots with different guests. But Mahesh's reaction reveals a dual response: economic interest ('even if you are not able to find this ghost roommate setup, I'm still getting paid' at 10:45) mixed with operational anxiety ('I've never dealt with that kind of a situation, obviously it comes with little complications' at 08:31). Cold Start Theory identifies this as a 'Hitting the Ceiling' dynamic: 'a rapidly growing network wants to both grow as well as tear itself apart, and there are enormous forces in both directions.' The ghost roommate feature accelerates the tipping point (more economic value per atomic network) but also introduces context collapse (two guests, two schedules, shared cleaning, overlapping stays). If the platform surfaces the economic upside without honestly addressing the operational complexity, hosts who encounter complications during the active lease will feel misled and churn. If it leads with the complexity, hosts will never reach the tipping point.",
      "solution": "Present the ghost roommate concept using a 'guaranteed floor with visible upside' framing that honestly addresses complexity. This means: (1) During evaluation, introduce ghost roommates as an optional accelerator, not a requirement: 'Your guaranteed rate is $2,600/month. If we find a weekend guest, your total earnings could increase to $X/month.' The guarantee is the floor; the ghost roommate is the ceiling. (2) During pricing, show a clear economic comparison: single-guest income vs. ghost-roommate income, with the additional operational responsibilities listed transparently alongside the additional income. The host should see both the money and the work. (3) During active lease, if a ghost roommate match is found, present a dedicated 'Ghost Roommate Preview' that shows: the proposed weekend guest's profile, the specific cleaning handoff protocol, the schedule overlap (if any), and the incremental income -- all in one view. The host decides with full information. (4) Provide a 'Ghost Roommate Operations Guide' that is specific to the host's property and stay pattern, not a generic FAQ. Include the cleaning transition times, key handoff procedures, and a clear escalation path for issues.

For Airbnb, it was 300 listings with 100 reviewed. Split Lease has no defined stability threshold for its atomic network (host + guest + platform). The 3-month initial lease is the natural candidate: approximately 12-13 weekly stays, each of which is a moment where the atomic network either strengthens or weakens. But the platform currently treats the active lease as a monolithic period rather than a sequence of measurable engagement moments that accumulate toward a stability threshold. Without a defined threshold and instrumentation to track progress toward it, the platform cannot identify at-risk leases before they fail to renew.",
      "solution": "Define the 3-month initial lease as Split Lease's atomic network stability test and instrument it accordingly. This means: (1) Identify the key engagement signals that correlate with lease extension: on-time payments received, host logins to the dashboard, guest check-in/check-out compliance, host-guest communication frequency, date change requests handled smoothly, and host satisfaction signals (e.g., response time to messages). (2) Create a 'Network Health Score' for each active lease that aggregates these signals into a single metric visible to the operations team (not necessarily to the host). A declining score triggers proactive outreach before the host decides not to renew. (3) Design the active lease period with deliberate engagement moments at weeks 2, 6, and 10 that check in with the host, surface the cumulative value delivered (total payments received, property protection events avoided), and prime the extension conversation. (4) At the 3-month mark, present the host with a 'Lease Performance Summary' that shows concrete outcomes: total income earned, on-time payment record, property protection status, and the guest's review/rating if applicable. This converts the abstract question 'should I extend?' into a concrete evidence-based decision.

(2) Build a 'Guarantee Dashboard' that persistently displays all active protections (payment guarantee status, host guarantee coverage, deposit held) so the host never needs to ask 'am I covered?' -- the answer is always visible.

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease", "retention"],
      "problem": "Mahesh has a management company, which implies a multi-unit property or a portfolio of properties under centralized management. Cold Start Theory's domino effect states that 'each launch makes the next set of adjacent networks easier, and easier, and easier, until the momentum becomes unstoppable -- but it all radiates from a small win at the very start.' If Mahesh's first lease succeeds, it creates not just a retained host, but a pathway into every other property under the same management company. However, the platform currently has no mechanism to leverage a successful lease as a seed for adjacent networks. The management company's approval pathway, once established, could be reused for other hosts. Mahesh's positive experience could be referenced when approaching other hosts in the same building. But without deliberate design for this domino effect, each new host in the same building starts from zero -- repeating the management company approval, the trust-building call, and the evaluation process as if no prior lease had ever occurred.",
      "solution": "Design the post-first-lease experience to deliberately tip adjacent networks. This means: (1) After a successful first lease (defined as: 3 months completed, payments on time, no unresolved disputes), ask the host: 'Do you have other units or know other hosts who might benefit from Split Lease?' Provide a one-click referral mechanism with a pre-written message the host can send. (2) For management-company-gated hosts, store the management company's approval pathway (contact person, required documentation format, approval timeline) as a reusable template. When another host under the same management company inquires, the platform can say: 'Your management company has already approved Split Lease guests. Here is the approved process.' This eliminates the gatekeeper barrier for subsequent hosts. (3) Create a 'Building Network' or 'Management Company Network' view for the operations team that shows all hosts under the same management entity and their conversion status. This makes the adjacent-network opportunity visible and actionable. (4) In markets approaching the tipping point, prioritize outreach to hosts under management companies that have already approved Split Lease, since the conversion path is already cleared. (5) Track the domino metric: for each management company that approves the first host, how many additional hosts convert within 6 months?",
