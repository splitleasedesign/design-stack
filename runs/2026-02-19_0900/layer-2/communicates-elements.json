      "problem": "Mahesh asks about financial risk three separate times during a 13-minute call: payment guarantee (02:17, 10:45), deposit handling (09:34), and property damage resolution (12:04). Each time, Bryant answers the question, but the information is delivered reactively -- only after Mahesh probes. Cold Start Theory identifies the hard side as having 'complex workflows' and 'higher expectations' that must be satisfied before they will form an atomic network. When the platform presents information about a listing, a guest, or a proposal, the current architecture forces the host to hunt for the single most important data point: 'Am I financially protected?' If the host must scroll past guest photos, stay dates, and amenity details before finding the guarantee, the information hierarchy is inverted relative to the host's actual decision tree. Mahesh's decision tree is: (1) Is my income guaranteed? (2) Is my property protected? (3) Who is this guest? (4) What are the logistics? Every screen that places logistics or guest details above guarantees misreads the hard side's scan priority.",
      "solution": "Structure every commitment-adjacent screen so that risk-absorption information occupies the primary visual position (top of hierarchy, largest type, first in scan order). On the proposal card: lead with 'Payment Guaranteed: $2,600/mo' and 'Property Protected: $1M Coverage Active' as the first two data points, before the guest name or stay dates. On the pricing confirmation: embed the guarantee inline with the rate ('$2,600/month -- guaranteed regardless of occupancy'). On the active lease dashboard: show a persistent 'Protection Status' bar at the top that confirms payment guarantee and property coverage are active, updated in real time. The host's eye should land on protection status before anything else. Guest details and logistics are important but secondary -- they answer 'who and when,' not the gating question of 'am I safe.'",

The platform currently has no mechanism to export guest information in a format the management company expects. Mahesh must become the translator: he receives vetting information from Split Lease, mentally reformats it, and then relays it to his management company in whatever format they accept. This translation labor is a cognitive tax that Cold Start Theory identifies as an enterprise adoption barrier: 'There are enterprise products like Workday that require the company to implement them before there's any value.' The information architecture fails because it treats the host as the sole consumer of guest information. In reality, there are two consumers: the host (who needs to evaluate the guest personally) and the management company (who needs a standard rental application format). The same underlying data must be structured for two different audiences, or the atomic network never forms.",

Bryant introduces it mid-conversation as 'something called a ghost roommate match' (07:34), immediately after Mahesh has just expressed comparison-anchoring to Furnished Finder (07:29). The information architecture problem: the ghost roommate is simultaneously the platform's strongest differentiator (doubled property yield) and its highest cognitive-load feature (two guests, shared cleaning, overlapping schedules). Cold Start Theory's 'Hitting the Ceiling' chapter identifies context collapse as what happens when network complexity exceeds user capacity. If all ghost roommate information is delivered at once -- economics, logistics, cleaning protocol, schedule overlap, opt-in/opt-out terms -- the host's working memory saturates and the concept collapses into 'complicated.'

Layer 2 (Match Found): When a ghost roommate match is identified, present a 'Ghost Roommate Preview' that adds operational context: proposed weekend guest profile, specific schedule (Friday 6pm to Monday 8am), cleaning handoff protocol, and the incremental income. This is a decision screen with both economic and operational data.

Split Lease's threshold is the 3-month initial lease -- approximately 12-13 weekly stays. During this period, the host is accumulating evidence for the renewal decision. But the current IA has no mechanism to surface cumulative evidence. Payment information exists but is transactional (each payment shown individually). Property protection status exists but is binary (active/inactive). The host must mentally aggregate 12 weeks of individual data points into a judgment.

      "problem": "Mahesh asks 'the agreement is, is it between which we, you know, for me, at least on my side, is it with you guys or it's a, the record?' (11:27). Bryant answers that Split Lease 'creates and hosts the agreement' and it is 'between yourself and then the one or two guests' (11:47). This exchange reveals a fundamental information architecture gap: the host does not know who his counterparty is. In a traditional rental, the counterparty is obvious -- the tenant. In Split Lease's model, the counterparty could be: the guest, Split Lease itself, or both (and possibly a ghost roommate as a third party). When Mahesh asks about property damage (12:04), he again needs to know the counterparty: 'Is that something that I would work with you or would that with the...' The IA must make the counterparty structure unambiguous at every phase, because the host's willingness to proceed depends on knowing who is on the other side of every obligation. Cold Start Theory shows that atomic networks require clear participant roles -- 'the right people, at the same time, using the product in the right way.'",
      "solution": "Surface a persistent 'Who's Involved' structure on every agreement-related screen that clearly identifies each party's role and responsibility. The structure: (1) 'Your Agreement' header with the parties named: 'Between you (Mahesh) and Ariel [Guest], hosted by Split Lease.' (2) Responsibility map: 'Payments: Split Lease guarantees and collects. Property protection: Split Lease covers up to $1M. Deposit: Split Lease holds $1,000. Communication: Direct with guest via platform. Disputes: Contact Split Lease.' (3) On the active lease dashboard, the counterparty structure appears in a 'Your Arrangement' summary card that the host can reference at any time without navigating away. The IA principle: the host should never wonder 'who do I call?' The counterparty for each type of interaction (payment, protection, communication, disputes) is explicitly labeled.",
