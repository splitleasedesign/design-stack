      "problem": "Mahesh asks about financial protection three separate times across a 13-minute call (02:17, 10:45, 12:04), each time because the platform has not yet answered the question before he needs to ask it. Cold Start Theory identifies that the hard side will 'try competitive products to compare' -- Mahesh is already comparing to Furnished Finder (07:29). Every moment the host spends wondering 'am I protected?' is a moment the anti-network effect gains strength. The interaction challenge: when a commitment-requesting surface loads (proposal card, pricing confirmation, agreement screen), the guarantee information must arrive before the host's risk-assessment reflex fires. If the guarantee appears after a loading delay, or only after scrolling, the host's System 1 has already flagged the screen as 'uncertain' and the cognitive frame shifts from acceptance to interrogation.",
      "solution": "When any commitment-adjacent surface loads, the protection status component must render first -- before guest details, stay logistics, or pricing breakdowns. The interaction sequence is: (1) skeleton screen appears with the protection bar placeholder at top, (2) protection status resolves and renders within 200ms (payment guarantee + property coverage), (3) remaining content fills in below. This ensures the host's first visual intake on any decision screen is 'you are protected,' establishing the cognitive frame before any decision content appears. If guarantee data is unavailable (network error, edge case), the error state explicitly says 'Guarantee status loading -- do not proceed until confirmed' rather than silently omitting the component. The pattern reverses the typical 'content first, assurance later' interaction into 'assurance first, content follows.'",

Cold Start Theory identifies this as an enterprise adoption barrier: 'There are enterprise products like Workday that require the company to implement them before there is any value.' The interaction challenge: the management company approval is an asynchronous, multi-day process that occurs outside the platform. The host initiates it (shares the package), waits for a response, and may need to follow up. During this waiting period, the platform has no visibility into the approval status, and the host has no way to track progress. If the platform does not model this external process as a visible state, the host experiences a black hole: they shared the document, and now... nothing. The momentum built by the call with Bryant dissipates into an undefined waiting period.",

A visible countdown begins: 'Shared 2 days ago. Management companies typically respond within 3-5 business days.' (3) 'Follow-Up Nudge' -- if 5 business days pass with no host update, the platform sends a notification: 'Has your management company responded? Update the status or we can help follow up.'

Cold Start Theory's Hitting the Ceiling chapter warns of context collapse: 'There's fraudsters, overcrowding, and context collapse -- all natural outcomes of a network that grows and matures.' Two guests sharing one property is a miniature context collapse that the interaction must manage. The challenge: if the platform presents the ghost roommate as a single binary decision (opt in or opt out), it forces the host to process all economic and operational information simultaneously, which triggers the anxiety Mahesh expresses. If it presents too many incremental steps, the host loses sight of the economic payoff and the engagement ladder feels like bureaucracy.",
      "solution": "Structure ghost roommate engagement as a three-rung ladder, each rung gated by the host's explicit action and each presenting exactly the right amount of information for that decision stage. Rung 1 (Awareness): During evaluation/pricing, a single inline element shows the potential upside: 'Weekend ghost roommate could increase total income to ~$X/mo.' The host can tap to learn more (expanding a brief explainer) or ignore it entirely. No action is required. Rung 2 (Preview): When a specific ghost roommate match is found, the platform presents a dedicated preview card with the proposed guest's profile, the exact schedule split (Mon-Fri / Fri-Mon), the cleaning handoff protocol, and the incremental income. Two clear actions: 'Accept Match' or 'Decline -- Keep Single Guest.' The host sees both the money and the work before deciding. Rung 3 (Operations): Once accepted, the Stays Manager shows a dual-guest view with a tab/toggle pattern separating weekday and weekend guest contexts. The host never sees both guests' operational details simultaneously -- one context at a time, switchable at will. Each rung is a complete interaction with a clear entry, a clear action, and a clear exit. The host can stop at any rung without penalty.",

Cold Start Theory identifies Slack's threshold (2,000 messages = 93% retention) as the model for engagement thresholds. Split Lease's equivalent is the 3-month initial lease (~12-13 weekly stays). The interaction challenge: during the active lease, the host has no engagement prompt that surfaces cumulative value. Payments arrive silently, stays complete without ceremony, and the property remains undamaged without acknowledgment. The host must mentally aggregate 12 weeks of non-events into a positive judgment at the renewal moment. Without deliberate interaction design, the absence of problems reads as 'nothing happened' rather than 'everything worked.' The platform must convert passive non-events into active evidence of success.",
      "solution": "Design a weekly 'pulse' interaction that surfaces cumulative lease health at the natural cadence of the stay cycle. After each weekly stay completes (guest checks out), the platform sends a brief, glanceable notification: 'Week [N] of 12 complete. Total received: $[X]. Property status: No issues reported.' The host can tap to view the full Lease Health dashboard or dismiss. At weeks 4, 8, and 12, the notification is elevated to a milestone summary with slightly richer content: 'Month [N] complete: $[X] received, [N] on-time payments, 0 incidents. You are [X]% through the initial lease.' The milestone at week 12 transitions into the renewal prompt: 'Initial lease complete. [Summary of outcomes]. Would you like to extend?' The interaction converts the passive passage of time into an active accumulation narrative that the host can see building toward the renewal decision.",

The copy is: 'Know other hosts in your building or under your management company? A successful lease like yours makes their approval faster.' One CTA: 'Share Split Lease.'
