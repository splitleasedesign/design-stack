      "problem": "Mahesh asks about financial protection three separate times across a 13-minute call (payment guarantee at 02:17 and 10:45, deposit at 09:34, property damage at 12:04). L2 identifies a 'Risk-Absorption-First Information Hierarchy' where guarantees must be the first thing the host sees. But information hierarchy alone does not solve the problem -- the visual treatment of guarantee information must signal permanence, authority, and unconditional protection at a glance. If guarantee badges look like secondary metadata (small type, muted color, standard weight), the host's eye will skip them even if they are positioned correctly. Cold Start Theory shows the hard side 'will try competitive products to compare' -- meaning the guarantee must visually outcompete anything Furnished Finder shows. The visual challenge is: how do you make a text-based guarantee feel as solid and immovable as the financial promise it represents, using the purple production palette to convey institutional authority without coldness?",
      "solution": "Create a dedicated 'Protection Status' visual component that uses the deepest primary purple (#31135D) as a solid background fill with white text, positioned at the top of every commitment-adjacent screen (proposal card, pricing confirmation, lease dashboard). The component uses Inter at --font-weight-bold (700) and --text-md (16px) for the headline ('Payment Guaranteed: $2,600/mo') and --text-sm (12px) / --font-weight-medium (500) for the secondary line ('Property Protected: $1M Coverage Active'). The dark-purple fill with white text creates the highest-contrast, most visually anchoring element on the screen -- the host's eye is drawn to it before any lighter-background content below. A subtle left-border accent in --secondary-purple (rgb(109, 49, 194)) at 3px width differentiates this from standard cards while reinforcing the brand. The component is non-collapsible and non-dismissible. On the active lease dashboard, it becomes a persistent header bar with a live status indicator (a small 8px circle in --accent-purple) confirming real-time coverage. The visual principle: guarantees are rendered in the visual language of permanence (darkest background, highest weight, top position), not in the visual language of notification (light background, standard weight, dismissible).",

L2 defines an 'Agent-to-Platform Trust Transfer Architecture' with a personalized handoff screen. The visual challenge is distinct from the information challenge: even with the right content, the handoff screen must visually feel like a continuation of a warm human conversation, not like a generic SaaS onboarding. Mahesh's only reference is Furnished Finder (07:29: 'I've never heard of this company... you're doing experience similar to Furnished Finder'). If the first platform screen looks like every other proptech dashboard -- gray backgrounds, standard cards, no personalization -- the visual language signals 'generic tool,' not 'the place Bryant told you about.'

The agent's note section uses a left-aligned vertical accent bar in --secondary-purple (3px wide) with the agent's name in DM Sans 600 16px and the note body in Inter 400 14px, creating a visual 'quoted speech' pattern that echoes human conversation. Pre-populated property details (rent, deposit, amenities) appear as a compact summary card with a subtle --shadow-purple-sm (0 2px 4px rgba(49,19,93,0.2)) to lift them above the background, signaling that this data was captured, not entered -- it 'arrived' on the platform from the conversation. The guest profile thumbnail uses a circular avatar (--avatar-md, 48px, --rounded-full) with a purple verification ring (2px solid --secondary-purple) to visually confirm vetting status. The single CTA at the bottom ('Review Ariel's Proposal') uses the --gradient-purple-button for the most visually assertive element on the screen.

L2 defines a three-layer progressive disclosure model (concept > preview > operations). The visual challenge is ensuring each layer looks visually distinct so the host never confuses which disclosure layer they are in, while maintaining visual continuity across the layers. If Layer 1 (evaluation teaser) and Layer 2 (full preview) look the same, the host cannot gauge how much more information is coming, increasing cognitive load. Cold Start Theory's 'context collapse' warning applies visually: two guests sharing one property could visually collapse into a confusing mosaic of overlapping schedules, names, and statuses unless the visual system clearly separates the two guest contexts.",
      "solution": "Assign each disclosure layer a progressively richer visual treatment that signals increasing information density. Layer 1 (Evaluation Teaser): A single-line inline callout within the pricing section, styled as a subtle highlight band with --bg-off-white background and a thin 1px --border-color bottom border. Text in Inter 400 14px --text-gray (#6b7280): 'Weekend ghost roommate could increase total income to ~$X/mo.' No card, no elevation, no purple -- this is informational whisper, not a decision prompt. Layer 2 (Match Found Preview): A distinct card component with --shadow-md elevation, --bg-white background, and a left-border in --accent-purple (4px) to signal 'new actionable item.' Inside, the two guests are shown in a split layout: left column for the weekday guest (existing), right column for the proposed weekend guest (new). The weekend guest column has a subtle --protocol-surface (#F7F2FA) background tint to visually distinguish it as 'proposed, not confirmed.' Schedule visualization uses a simple 7-column week strip where Mon-Fri cells are filled in --secondary-purple and Sat-Sun cells in --accent-purple, creating an immediate visual mapping of who occupies which days. Layer 3 (Active Lease Operations): Full dashboard integration within the Stays Manager. The two-guest context uses a tab or toggle pattern at the top of the stay view: 'Weekday Guest | Weekend Guest' in Inter 500 14px, with the active tab underlined in --secondary-purple (2px). Each tab loads its own context (schedule, cleaning status, payment). The visual principle: the ghost roommate is introduced as a whisper (Layer 1), elevated to a card (Layer 2), and finally integrated into the dashboard architecture (Layer 3).

Below the progress bar, three aggregate KPIs appear in a horizontal row of compact cards: (1) Total Income Received (DM Sans 700 24px --primary-purple, the largest number on the screen), (2) On-Time Payment Rate (Inter 600 16px --text-dark, as a percentage), (3) Incidents (Inter 600 16px --text-dark, ideally '0' rendered in --secondary-purple to make zero feel positive). At the 3-month mark, the meter fills completely with a completion animation (left-to-right fill in 0.6s ease-out) and a 'Lease Performance Summary' overlay card appears with the renewal CTA. The visual principle: the host should be able to glance at the dashboard and immediately see 'I am X weeks into a 12-week journey, everything is green, here is how much I have earned.' The progress bar converts abstract time into visible advancement.",

      "problem": "Mahesh cannot parse the contractual structure from conversation alone (11:27: 'The agreement is, is it between which we, you know, for me, at least on my side, is it with you guys or it's a, the record?'). L2 defines an 'Agreement Counterparty Clarity Architecture' with a responsibility map. The visual challenge is representing a three-party relationship (host, guest, platform) in a way that is immediately parseable without reading dense text. Traditional legal documents list parties in paragraphs; digital products often use a single 'terms' link. Neither works for a host who needs to know, at a glance, who handles payments, who handles damage, and who they communicate with. Cold Start Theory's atomic network requires 'the right people, at the same time, using the product in the right way' -- visually, each participant's role must be as clear as a labeled node in a network diagram.",
      "solution": "Design an 'Arrangement Summary' card that uses a minimal three-column visual layout: Host (you) | Split Lease | Guest. Each column is headed by a role label in Inter 600 12px --text-gray, with the participant's name below in Inter 500 14px --text-dark. Below the column headers, a series of horizontal rows map each responsibility to its handler using a simple filled-dot indicator: Payments row shows the dot in the Split Lease column (--secondary-purple, 10px circle), Property Protection shows the dot in the Split Lease column, Communication shows dots in both the Host and Guest columns (indicating direct communication), and Disputes shows the dot in the Split Lease column. Row labels use Inter 400 13px --text-description (#374151). The entire card uses --bg-white with --shadow-sm elevation and --rounded-lg (8px) corners. The Split Lease column has a subtle --protocol-surface (#F7F2FA) background tint to visually distinguish the platform as the intermediary party. This card appears as a persistent sidebar element on the lease dashboard and is promoted to primary position on agreement-signing and claim-initiation screens. The visual principle: the host should never need to read a paragraph to understand who handles what. The dot-matrix layout converts legal complexity into spatial clarity in under 5 seconds.",
