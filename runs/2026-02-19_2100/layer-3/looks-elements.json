      "problem": "At discovery, the guest encounters the platform as a stranger encountering an imagined reality for the first time. If social proof elements (review counts, activity indicators, guest testimonials) are visually subordinate to functional elements (search bars, filters, CTAs), the guest receives the wrong signal: the platform is asking them to act before it has proven that others believe in this fiction. The visual hierarchy must weight social proof heavily enough to establish the myth's credibility at first glance.",
      "solution": "Apply a visual treatment that elevates social proof to primary visual weight in the discovery viewport. Aggregate trust numbers (e.g., '2,400+ verified stays') use the serif heading typeface at a prominent size with accent color. Testimonial cards sit alongside listing cards in the browse grid, not relegated to a separate testimonials section. Activity indicators (recently booked, new listing) use the signal-info color on accent-light backgrounds to stand out without competing with the primary content.",
