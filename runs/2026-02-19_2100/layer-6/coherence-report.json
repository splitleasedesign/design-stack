The new element uses Harari's collective fiction framework to prescribe that the platform's myth must be demonstrated (real listings, social proof) before any participation is requested. Both agree that the first 2 seconds determine everything, and both prescribe evidence-first, demand-second sequencing.",

The difficulty lies not in telling the story, but in convincing everyone else to believe it.' User stories: 'Show something useful first. Offer to refine after.' The combined insight is that value-before-ask (Sapiens) and System 1 trust gates (Kahneman) are the same principle operating at different psychological levels -- one addresses belief formation, the other addresses automatic cognitive appraisal.",

Both arrive at the same structural prescription: the form should feel like signing a prepared document, not drafting one from scratch.",

New evidence: Harari's 'Once the lawyer had performed all the right rituals... hocus pocus -- a new company was incorporated.'

      "confidence_note": "Medium-high confidence. The user stories explicitly call for a living map ('Transit stops, landmarks, real-time context -- this is about mood, not just utility'), and the Sapiens dual-reality framework provides strong theoretical grounding.

Existing elements address the proposal as the first formal interaction point. The Sapiens gossip theory reveals a critical gap: the guest needs a way to directly assess the host as a person (not just a listing) before committing to a formal cooperation proposal. Messaging is the platform's gossip channel -- the evolutionary mechanism for trust-building through direct social interaction.",
      "confidence_note": "High confidence. The user stories explicitly identify messaging before proposals as a natural step ('The park analogy holds -- you check availability before committing'), and the Sapiens gossip framework explains why: humans evolved to require direct interpersonal assessment before cooperation.

The House Manual as a structured, four-section 'law book' for stranger-cooperation is a new concept in the library.",

The Sapiens lens uniquely reveals that move-in is the moment where the platform cannot directly control the experience -- the guest is offline, in a physical space, encountering a real stranger. The emotional design must therefore focus on preparation rather than real-time intervention.",
