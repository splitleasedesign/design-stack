Pre-populated fields reduce the anxiety of 'am I doing this right?' by showing the guest that the platform has prepared the ritual for them.

        "timing": "The 'Yes, Proceed' to confirmation arc must complete within 3 seconds. The relief must arrive before the guest has time to second-guess.

      "problem": "Move-in is where Harari's 'dual reality' becomes experiential — the guest's imagined reality (the listing, the reviews, the lease) collides with objective reality (the physical space, the actual host). If the physical reality matches the fiction, trust deepens and the cooperation is reinforced. If it diverges (inaccurate photos, missing amenities, awkward host interaction), the entire trust framework collapses. The guest is at maximum vulnerability: fully committed, physically present, and emotionally exposed.",
      "solution": "The emotional design at move-in focuses on anchoring the guest in prepared confidence — the feeling of 'I know what to expect, I have the information I need, and I have a channel to resolve issues.' The House Manual becomes the emotional anchor: a structured, accessible reference that the guest has already reviewed before arrival. A move-in-day notification nudge ('Your check-in at Sara's is today — here is your House Manual') reinforces preparation. The first-day messaging prompt ('Let Sara know you have arrived') normalizes communication and reduces the awkwardness of the first stranger-to-stranger encounter.",

          "insight": "Move-in is the most acute dual-reality moment in the guest journey. The emotional design must help the guest navigate the gap between what they imagined (the listing) and what they encounter (the space). Preparation and communication are the bridges."

The platform's relief mechanism is preparation, not real-time intervention.",
