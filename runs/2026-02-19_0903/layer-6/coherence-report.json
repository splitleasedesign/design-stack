Both calls show the same structural failure from different theoretical angles. Kahneman explains WHY the trust gap exists (priming failure); Thiel explains WHY it matters commercially (scalability barrier). The combined insight is: the trust transfer protocol is both a cognitive design imperative (Kahneman) and a monopoly-building imperative (Thiel).

The Thiel lens has stronger evidence for this specific question because the 'one-tap' micro-review (5 stars, under 10 seconds) is a fundamentally different ask than the traditional text review that guest-communicates-007 is guarding against. The key insight: one-tap reviews are NOT depleting in the way text reviews are.

      "reason": "The emotional design for the co-tenant Zoom introduction (negotiation phase) is underspecified. The call describes this as the highest-friction social moment ('we introduce you guys in the form of a Zoom meeting,' 07:26-07:48) but no L5 element specifically designs the emotional experience of meeting a stranger you will share a home with. This is where the co-tenancy model either wins or loses the guest emotionally.",
      "new_input": "The Zoom introduction is where Thiel's 0-to-1 value becomes personal: no other platform introduces co-tenants before they share a space. The emotional design should target 'relieved compatibility' -- the guest should leave the Zoom feeling 'this person seems reasonable, this will work.' Pre-Zoom anxiety reduction (what to expect, conversation prompts, time limit) and post-Zoom confirmation ('How did it go? Rate your compatibility') are both missing."

      "reason": "The visual design for the agent trust bridge FAB (floating action button) uses a gradient-purple-button token that may conflict with the primary CTA styling. If both the FAB and the main page CTA use purple gradients, the visual hierarchy is ambiguous: two competing call-to-action elements on the same screen.",
      "new_input": "Consider differentiating the FAB visually from primary CTAs. The FAB is an escape hatch (contact Bryant), not the primary action. Its visual weight should be below the primary CTA. Options: solid secondary-purple instead of gradient, or a smaller 40px size with a subtle shadow rather than the full 48px with the gradient."
