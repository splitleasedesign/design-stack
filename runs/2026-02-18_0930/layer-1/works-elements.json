      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "search", "listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation", "acceptance"],
      "problem": "The guest journey currently presents a single, high-stakes commitment moment: proposal submission. Before that, there are no meaningful commitment mechanisms. After it, there are no reinforcement mechanisms until the first stay. This creates a binary dynamic: the guest is either uncommitted (and easily lost) or fully committed (and anxious about the leap). Cialdini's research shows that large commitments without preceding small ones feel coerced and produce fragile compliance. Tamycka's call reveals a guest who is interested but cautious -- she asks probing questions about the process (10:07), the app vs. the service (16:09), and pricing (04:38) before making any commitment. Without a ladder of small, voluntary commitments that gradually shift her self-image from 'browser' to 'serious prospect' to 'committed guest,' the platform relies entirely on the phone call to bridge the commitment gap.",
      "solution": "Design a sequence of small, voluntary commitments at each phase transition that escalate naturally: (1) Discovery: Ask the guest one qualifying question ('What brings you to Split Lease?') that mirrors the phone call's opening and creates the first recorded self-description. (2) Search: Allow saving listings with a personalized note ('Why I liked this listing'). This written micro-commitment is a foot-in-the-door per Cialdini. (3) Listing Evaluation: Offer a 'Configure Your Stay' interaction where the guest selects their days and sees their price BEFORE creating a proposal. This is a commitment-without-consequence that shifts self-image. (4) Proposal Creation: The proposal itself is the major written commitment. Frame it as the guest's choice, not the platform's demand. (5) Acceptance: Post-acceptance, prompt the guest to share their plan with someone ('Tell your babysitter about your new Thursday routine') -- this creates a public commitment that makes cancellation psychologically costly. Each step must feel self-directed (Cialdini's 'inner choice' principle), not pressured.",

Can other people like me make this work? Currently, the platform provides no social proof from similar others at any of these gates. Generic metrics ('1000+ stays completed') do not resolve uncertainty for a budget-constrained working parent with specific safety needs. Cialdini's research demonstrates that social proof is most powerful under two conditions: uncertainty and similarity. Tamycka has both. She is uncertain about the platform, the process, and child safety. And she is a specific demographic (working parent, recurring guest, budget-conscious) whose decisions would be most influenced by proof from similar others, not from generic popularity.",

(3) Proposal Creation: 'Guests who book Thursday-Saturday packages save an average of 30% vs. nightly rates.' (4) Active Lease: 'Other recurring guests like you submit cleaning photos after each stay -- here is how.' The similarity must be specific and relevant: parent status, recurring schedule, budget range, geographic flexibility. Generic 'X users love this listing' is weak social proof. 'A working mom with two kids stayed here every Thursday for 4 months' is powerful social proof because it resolves Tamycka's specific uncertainties through a similar other's validated experience.",

      "title": "Written Commitment Reinforcement Through Weekly Stay Reviews",
      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "Traditional review systems ask for a single review after checkout. For a guest like Tamycka on a recurring 3-night/week lease, a single post-lease review is structurally incapable of capturing the evolving relationship or building habit-level commitment. Cialdini's research on written commitments (Ch. 3) shows that each written declaration creates physical evidence of commitment, shifts self-image, and is visible to others -- all of which deepen loyalty. The current platform design misses the opportunity to use weekly reviews as a commitment-building mechanism. Each review Tamycka writes is a written, semi-public commitment that shifts her self-image from 'someone trying Split Lease' to 'a committed recurring guest who documents her experience.' After 10+ reviews, the commitment becomes self-sustaining.",
      "solution": "Implement one-tap micro-reviews after each weekly stay cycle, designed as commitment-building instruments rather than just feedback collection: (1) After each stay, prompt a one-tap rating (1-5 stars) plus optional one-line note. This takes under 10 seconds. (2) Make reviews visible to the guest themselves as a timeline ('Your stay history: 12 stays, average rating 4.7'). This creates Cialdini's 'physical evidence that the act occurred.' (3) Aggregate reviews into a narrative visible to future guests ('A recurring Thursday guest has rated this space 4.8 over 12 stays'). This creates social proof for other similar guests. (4) Frame reviews as the guest's choice, not a platform requirement. Cialdini's inner choice principle: 'We accept inner responsibility for a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the absence of strong outside pressures.' A gentle prompt is fine; a forced gate is counterproductive. (5) After 5+ reviews, show the guest their own commitment evidence: 'You have rated this space across 5 stays -- your experience is helping other parents find the right fit.' This leverages both written commitment and social proof simultaneously.",

      "problem": "Tamycka is aggressively price-sensitive ('more a price than it is location', 17:15) and has been anchored by Igor to expect sub-$75/night for bulk bookings (05:26). The current platform flow shows a nightly rate on the listing page but calculates the total only during proposal creation. If the calculated total differs significantly from the guest's mental anchor, the experience feels like Cialdini's lowball technique: 'An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase decision; then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed.' This is particularly toxic for a budget-constrained parent who cannot afford buyer's remorse. The lowball perception does not require actual deception -- it only requires that the guest's price expectation was set earlier (by the listing page, by the phone call) and then violated later (during proposal configuration or host counter-offer).",
      "solution": "Ensure price is fully transparent and consistent at every phase: (1) Search: Show the estimated cost for the guest's configured schedule (not just per-night rate) in search results. If Tamycka has indicated '3 nights/week for 10 weeks,' show '$X total' on each search card. (2) Listing Evaluation: Show a live price calculator that updates as the guest configures days, duration, and extras. No surprises during proposal creation. (3) Proposal Creation: The price shown must be identical to what the guest previewed on the listing page. If there are fees (platform fee, cleaning fee, first-night deposit), they must appear BEFORE proposal submission, not after. (4) Negotiation: If the host counters with a different price, show the delta explicitly ('Host suggested $X/night instead of your $Y/night -- a difference of $Z per stay'). Frame the counter as a transparent negotiation, not a bait-and-switch. (5) Never remove a price advantage after the guest has mentally committed. Cialdini: once a commitment generates its own supporting reasons, removing the original reason does not collapse the decision. But for a budget guest, the original price IS the primary supporting reason. Removing it collapses everything.",
