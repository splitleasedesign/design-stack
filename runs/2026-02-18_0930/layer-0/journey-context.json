For a working parent with two young children, the uncertainty is compounded by safety concerns. Social proof from similar others (other parents, other brand ambassadors, other budget-conscious guests) would be the single most powerful mechanism to convert discovery interest into active search. The call reveals Tamycka is a savvy shopper ('Can a person...are you doing what the app does?', 16:09) who actively cross-references the service offering against the self-service option, suggesting she evaluates platforms comparatively before committing.",

Columbia wallet experiment: 70% returned wallet when first finder was similar vs. 33% when dissimilar. Tamycka's child safety concern (04:24) and budget concern (17:15) are uncertainty gates that similar-other proof could resolve."

Freedman's forbidden-toy experiment: mild instruction produced lasting behavioral change (67% avoidance at 6 weeks) while strong threats produced none (only 23% avoidance). Tamycka must feel she chose Split Lease, not that she was pushed into it."

Tamycka's price anchoring (04:38-05:19) sets an expectation that must be honored throughout the funnel. Igor's promise of sub-$75/night for bulk bookings (05:26-05:28) becomes the anchor."
