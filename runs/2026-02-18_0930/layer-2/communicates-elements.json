      "problem": "Tamycka's decision tree is: Price first -> Location second -> Child safety third -> Everything else. The current listing page information hierarchy does not match this tree. The listing page leads with photos, location, and amenities, then shows nightly rate, then calculates total only at proposal time. For a guest whose first filter is 'Can I afford this?', the current information order forces her to invest cognitive effort in irrelevant details before she gets the answer to her primary question. Cialdini's commitment research warns that if the full price is revealed only after the guest has mentally committed (configured days, imagined herself in the space), any price surprise triggers the lowball perception. The information architecture must reveal price progressively but completely before any commitment action.",
      "solution": "Restructure the information hierarchy across three surfaces to match the budget guest's decision tree: (1) Search Results Card: Lead with total estimated cost for the guest's configured schedule (e.g., '$225/week for Thu-Fri-Sat'), not per-night rate. Show per-night rate as secondary context. Include a small badge for child-safety verification if applicable. This answers Tamycka's primary question ('Can I afford this?') before she clicks. (2) Listing Page: Open with a price calculator panel that updates live as the guest configures days and duration. Show the total, the per-night rate, and any bulk discounts earned. Below the calculator, show photos and space details. Below that, safety features and host info. Below that, reviews from similar guests. The scan order mirrors the decision tree. (3) Proposal Summary: Before submission, show a full price breakdown with all fees, explicitly compared to the per-night rate she saw in search. No new information should appear here. This is a confirmation of what she already knows, not a reveal.",

      "problem": "The current listing page, if it shows reviews or social proof at all, treats them as a separate section at the bottom of the page -- below the fold, after photos, amenities, and rules. For a guest like Tamycka, who is uncertain about child safety and platform legitimacy, social proof from similar others is not supplementary information -- it is primary decision-making data. Cialdini: 'when we are unsure of ourselves...we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct' (Ch. 4). Placing social proof below the fold means the guest must invest significant scrolling and reading before reaching the information that would most effectively resolve her uncertainty. Many guests will drop off before they get there. The information architecture fails to serve the uncertainty-resolution function that social proof provides.",
      "solution": "Integrate social proof into the primary information hierarchy at three strategic points: (1) Listing Page Header Zone: Immediately below the listing title/price, show a compact social proof line: '4 recurring guests | 2 families with children | Avg. stay: 8 weeks.' This is not a review section; it is a trust signal placed at the point of first uncertainty. (2) Safety Context: Adjacent to the child-safety/family-friendly badge, show the most relevant similar-other quote: 'A mother of two said: Clean, safe, perfect for my Thursday routine.' This resolves the specific safety uncertainty Tamycka has. (3) Proposal Confidence Zone: On the proposal creation page, just above the submit button, show a reinforcing social proof line: 'Guests who book 3 nights/week save 28% vs. nightly rates. 15 guests have this schedule.' This normalizes the action she is about to take. In all three cases, the social proof must be (a) specific to the guest's situation (parent, recurring, budget), (b) compact (one line or badge, not a review section), and (c) placed at the moment of uncertainty, not after it.",

      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Tamycka asked multiple process questions in the call: 'how does that process work? Like, do I send money? And then there's a lockbox and then I have a security code?' (10:07-10:16), 'can I also use the app?' (14:33-14:39), 'are you doing what the app does?' (16:09-16:13). These questions reveal deep uncertainty about the operational process of Split Lease. For a first-time user, the platform's novel model (shared-space, recurring nights, lockbox access, host negotiation) is unlike any prior experience. Cialdini's social proof research on pluralistic ignorance shows that when people are uncertain about how to behave, they look to others for guidance. But on the platform, there are no visible 'others' showing how the process works. The guest must either figure it out alone (high cognitive load) or call Igor (defeating the platform's purpose). The information architecture must proactively answer the process questions Tamycka asked verbally.",
      "solution": "Create a contextual process explainer that appears at three strategic moments: (1) Discovery/First Visit: A compact 'How It Works' module showing the 4-step guest journey (Browse -> Propose -> Agree -> Stay) with a single line for each step. This should be visible on the homepage without scrolling. Frame it as social proof: 'Here is how 200+ guests found their recurring NYC stay.' (2) Listing Page: Before the 'Create Proposal' button, show a 3-step micro-explainer of what happens next: 'You configure your preferred days -> You submit a proposal -> The host responds within 48 hours.' This removes the uncertainty Tamycka expressed at 10:07. (3) Proposal Creation: As the guest configures days and duration, show contextual tooltips explaining each choice: 'Choosing 30+ nights unlocks bulk pricing' (addresses her 05:09 question), 'Your first payment is by credit card' (addresses the payment process from the call). Each explainer should be compact (under 50 words per context), contextual (appears where the question arises), and social-proof-enhanced ('Most guests complete this in under 3 minutes').",

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "During the active lease, the guest's Leases page currently shows payment schedules and date management. What it does not show is the guest's own commitment history: how many stays completed, reviews written, cleaning photos submitted, date changes requested. Cialdini's written commitment research (Ch. 3) demonstrates that physical evidence of prior actions is one of the strongest commitment-maintenance mechanisms: 'it provides physical evidence that the act occurred. Once a man wrote what the Chinese wanted, it was very difficult for him to believe that he had not done so.' For a recurring guest like Tamycka, her stay history IS her commitment evidence. If the platform makes this evidence visible, scannable, and progressive (a timeline that grows with each stay), it reinforces her identity as a committed, invested guest. Without this visibility, each weekly visit feels isolated rather than part of a building pattern.",
      "solution": "Add a Stay Timeline to the active lease view that surfaces the guest's commitment history as a growing visual narrative: (1) Timeline Entries: Each completed stay appears as a compact card showing date, rating (if given), and cleaning photo status. The timeline grows downward with each stay, creating a visible accumulation of commitment evidence. (2) Summary Stats: At the top of the timeline, show aggregate metrics: 'Completed stays: 12 | Your average rating: 4.7 | Host's rating of you: 4.9 | Cleaning photos: 11/12.' These are Cialdini's 'physical evidence' made scannable. (3) Milestone Markers: At stay 5, 10, 20, show a milestone badge: 'You have completed 10 stays at this space -- you are among our most committed recurring guests.' This is a public commitment reinforcement that shifts self-image. (4) Social Context: Show how the guest's engagement compares to similar guests: 'You review more consistently than 80% of recurring guests.' This uses social proof to reinforce commitment behavior. The timeline should be the first thing the guest sees when opening the Leases page, before payment schedule or date management.",
