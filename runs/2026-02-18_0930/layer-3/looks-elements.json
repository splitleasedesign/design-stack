      "problem": "The micro-commitment escalation ladder (works-0930-001) requires visual feedback that signals progress without creating pressure. Currently, the guest journey has no visual language for commitment progression. Each step looks the same regardless of how far the guest has invested. Cialdini's commitment research shows that people become more confident AFTER committing ('racetrack effect'), but the platform provides no visual reinforcement of this growing confidence. For Tamycka, who is budget-constrained and cautious, the visual design must make each completed micro-commitment feel like progress toward a goal, not like an obligation being loaded onto her.",
      "solution": "Use graduated intensity of the brand purple palette to signal commitment depth across the journey: (1) Browsing state (no commitment): Use the lightest purple tint (--bg-off-white, rgb(252,250,255)) as the dominant background. Interactive elements use --text-gray (#6b7280). The visual tone is neutral and low-pressure. (2) Interest state (listing saved, days configured): Introduce --secondary-purple (rgb(109,49,194)) as accent on the configured elements. The saved listing card gets a subtle left border in secondary purple. The day-configuration selector uses --chat-purple (rgb(75,71,206)) for selected days. The visual tone shifts to 'engaged.' (3) Commitment state (proposal submitted): The proposal confirmation uses --primary-purple (#31135D) as the dominant color. The confirmation card has a --gradient-purple-primary background (linear-gradient(135deg, #31135D 0%, #5a2d8f 100%)). The visual tone is 'invested and confident.' (4) Confirmed state (terms accepted): Full --primary-purple header with white text, --shadow-purple-lg glow on the lease card. The visual tone is 'arrived and settled.' This graduated approach uses the existing purple palette to create a visual commitment thermometer that the guest subconsciously reads as progress. No new colors are needed; the existing tokens provide sufficient range from bg-off-white to primary-purple-dark.",

      "problem": "The information architecture elements (communicates-0930-002) define where social proof should appear, but not how it should look. Social proof from similar others ('3 families with children have stayed here') needs a distinct visual treatment that signals credibility without competing with the primary content hierarchy. Cialdini's social proof principle works even when people know the evidence is manufactured (canned laughter still works). But for maximum effectiveness, the visual treatment must signal authenticity: real data, from real people, about this specific listing. The challenge is to make social proof visually distinct (so it registers in the scan) but not decorative (so it signals data, not marketing).",
      "solution": "Create a social proof badge system using the DM Sans font family for differentiation from the Inter-based UI content: (1) Badge Container: A compact inline element with --bg-off-white (rgb(252,250,255)) background and 1px --border-color (#e5e7eb) border, using --rounded-pill (20px) for a pill shape. This visually separates social proof from content without using a loud color or shadow. (2) Badge Typography: DM Sans at --text-sm (12px) with --font-weight-medium (500). Using DM Sans (the alternative display font from Style-guide.md) differentiates social proof from UI labels (Inter) and body content (Inter/Helvetica), signaling that this is a different category of information: observed evidence, not platform-generated content. (3) Badge Icon: A small Feather icon (users, heart, check-circle) at --icon-xs (16px) in --text-purple (rgb(82,31,147)) preceding the text. The icon adds visual distinctiveness without adding cognitive load. (4) Badge Data: Numerical data within the badge should use --font-weight-semibold (600) to create emphasis within the compact format: '3 families | 8 avg. weeks.' The bold numbers draw the eye to the evidence while the regular-weight context words provide framing. (5) Placement: Badges should always appear inline with related content (adjacent to listing title, adjacent to safety badge, above submit button), never in a separate section. This follows the communicates-0930-002 principle of placing social proof at the point of uncertainty.",

Currently, the platform has no visual differentiation between family-friendly and general listings. For Tamycka, the absence of safety signals is itself a signal of uncertainty ('I have no evidence that this space is safe for my children'). Cialdini's pluralistic ignorance concept applies: if no one is visually signaling safety concern, a cautious parent may assume either that safety is not an issue (unlikely for a parent of a 5-month-old) or that the platform is not designed for families (likely conclusion). The visual system must create an unambiguous safety signal that is scannable in under 2 seconds on both search results and listing pages.",
      "solution": "Design a family-friendly verification badge using the existing token system with warm accent colors for differentiation: (1) Badge Design: A compact pill badge using --accent-blue (#4A90E2) as the badge background with --white text. Blue is chosen because it is already in the system, carries associations with safety and trust, and visually differentiates from the purple commitment signals (preventing badge confusion). The badge reads 'Family-Friendly' with a Feather shield icon (feathericons.com: 'shield') at --icon-xs (16px). (2) Search Card Placement: The badge appears in the top-left corner of the listing card, overlaying the photo. This ensures it is visible during a rapid scan of search results. (3) Listing Page Placement: The badge appears adjacent to the listing title, followed by a compact expandable detail line: 'Verified by host + 2 families: Disinfection between guests, outlet covers available, cleaning products secured.' (4) Verification Level Indicators: The badge intensity increases with verification depth: host-declared only (--accent-blue at --opacity-hover 0.8), host + 1 family verified (full --accent-blue), host + 3+ families verified (--accent-blue with a subtle --shadow-sm). This graduated approach echoes the commitment visualization pattern (looks-0930-001) and rewards hosts who accumulate family verification.

But the visual treatment of price information on the current platform follows standard e-commerce conventions: nightly rate in large text, total in smaller text below. For a budget-first guest like Tamycka, this hierarchy is inverted. She needs the total cost for her configured stay to be the visually dominant number, with the per-night rate as supporting context. Additionally, bulk discount savings must be visually salient -- Tamycka was explicitly told she could get below $75/night for 30+ nights (05:26-05:28). The savings compared to nightly booking should be visually celebrated, not buried in fine print.

It is visually contained, creating a 'price zone' that the eye can locate instantly.
