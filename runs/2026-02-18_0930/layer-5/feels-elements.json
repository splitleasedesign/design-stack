      "problem": "Tamycka is a working parent who just had a baby five months ago and is re-entering the workforce. She carries financial anxiety that colors every interaction with the platform. When she sees a listing price, her first emotional response is not curiosity or excitement -- it is a gut-check: 'Can I afford this?' If the answer is unclear, uncertain, or requires calculation, the emotional response shifts to anxiety and self-doubt ('Maybe this service is not for people in my situation'). The current platform shows per-night rates that require mental multiplication to assess affordability, forcing System 2 math on an emotionally loaded question. This transforms price discovery from a confidence-building moment into a stress test.",
      "solution": "The emotional target at price discovery is confidence: 'This is within my budget and I can see exactly how.' Every price surface must deliver the feeling of 'I can do this' within the first 2 seconds. The copy voice should be factual, direct, and affirming without being patronizing. The price calculator (looks-0930-004) should feel like a trusted advisor showing you a number, not a cash register totaling up charges. The total-first hierarchy communicates respect for the guest's intelligence and time. The savings indicator ('You save $180 vs. nightly rates') transforms the price from a cost into an achievement. The emotional arc is: see total -> feel relief -> see savings -> feel smart.",

When she evaluates a listing, her System 1 is scanning for danger signals: Is this space clean? Is it safe for a crawling infant? Will other guests' belongings be hazardous? The current platform provides no emotional resolution for this anxiety. Feature lists ('microwave, refrigerator, wifi') do not address safety. Host descriptions ('cozy apartment in Midtown') do not address cleanliness. Only evidence from similar others -- other parents who stayed with their children and validated the space -- can resolve the anxiety because Cialdini's social proof under uncertainty says: 'when uncertainty reigns, we are most likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.' And the similarity condition amplifies this: proof from another parent is twice as powerful as proof from a generic guest.",

The family-friendly badge (looks-0930-003) should feel like a quality mark verified by peers, not a platform-granted label.

(10:10), How does the security code work? (10:10), Do I pay for three days up front? (10:56), Can I use the app? (14:33), Are you doing what the app does? (16:09). Each question reveals a gap between what she knows and what she needs to know to feel comfortable committing. On the phone, Igor resolved each gap in real time. On the platform, these gaps persist as ambient anxiety: 'I do not fully understand how this works, and I cannot ask someone.' Cialdini's pluralistic ignorance principle warns that when no one is visibly asking these questions, Tamycka may conclude that she is the only one who does not understand -- and leave rather than look foolish.",
      "solution": "The target emotion is calm -- the feeling of 'I understand how this works, and it is simpler than I thought.' The platform must proactively answer the seven questions Tamycka asked, placing the answers at the exact moments where the questions arise. The copy voice should be explanatory without being condescending: assume the guest is smart but unfamiliar. Use social proof to normalize the questions: 'Most first-time guests have the same question' breaks pluralistic ignorance. The 'How It Works' module (communicates-0930-003) delivers process clarity as a compact, scannable flow that replaces ambient anxiety with confident understanding.",
