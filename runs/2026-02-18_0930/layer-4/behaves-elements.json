      "problem": "The listing page currently has only two interaction states: browsing (passive) and submitting a proposal (high-commitment). There is no intermediate state that lets the guest take a small, voluntary action that shifts their self-image from browser to prospect. Cialdini's foot-in-the-door research shows that a 76% compliance rate on a large request follows a small prior commitment. Without intermediate states, the guest must leap from zero commitment to full proposal, which triggers commitment anxiety, especially for a budget-constrained parent like Tamycka who is evaluating whether she can afford this and whether it is safe for her children.",
      "solution": "Add three intermediate interaction states to the listing page that escalate commitment gradually: (1) 'Save Listing' with optional note -- a written micro-commitment per Cialdini Ch. 3. (2) 'Configure Your Stay' -- selecting days and seeing the live price calculator updates without creating a formal proposal. This is a commitment-without-consequence that shifts self-image. (3) 'Start Proposal' -- the configured stay becomes a draft proposal. Each state change updates the visual treatment (looks-0930-001 graduated purple intensity) and persists across sessions. The transitions between states must feel self-directed and reversible (Cialdini's 'inner choice' principle), not gated or pressured.",

This optimistic value is displayed immediately. (2) Server validation: A background request validates the optimistic calculation against actual availability and any dynamic pricing rules. If the server-validated price matches the optimistic price, no visible change occurs. (3) Delta disclosure: If the server-validated price differs (e.g., a day is no longer available, or a bulk discount threshold was crossed), the calculator shows the change explicitly: 'Updated: $675 -> $690 (Saturday Jan 18 unavailable at original rate).' The delta is always explained. (4) Fee inclusion: All fees are included in the displayed total from the first calculation.
