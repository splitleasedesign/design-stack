      "problem": "When the platform introduces a norm-breaking term (like payment after first night instead of upfront at signing), the host needs immediate visual evidence that peers have accepted it. Currently, no distinct visual component exists for surfacing peer proof. Generic text explanations blend into the surrounding UI, giving the host no rapid way to distinguish 'what landlords like me have done' from 'what the platform is telling me.' John ignored the doubled deposit ($6,000 vs. $3,000) because it was presented as platform information, not peer-validated evidence. The visual system lacks a component that signals 'this is what someone like you experienced' at a glance.",
      "solution": "Create a visually distinct peer proof card pattern that is immediately recognizable as 'evidence from a similar host' -- not platform marketing. The card uses a warm surface background (surface-warm token) with a left accent border in the forest green (accent token) to visually separate it from standard UI cards. The host's similarity markers (city, experience years) appear in mono font at the top, signaling data credibility. The outcome statement uses serif font for warmth and human voice. The card must be compact enough to scan in under 5 seconds and distinct enough to never be confused with a platform feature description or marketing callout.",

      "problem": "Hosts evaluate tenant quality and platform terms through different trust frameworks, but the current visual flow presents both as undifferentiated information. John was cooperative when evaluating Ariel and Amber (02:12-03:50) but became resistant when platform payment terms arrived (05:40 onward). The shift happened because the two types of information looked and felt the same -- there was no visual signal that the host was transitioning from 'evaluating people' to 'evaluating a platform's terms.' Without visual separation, a negative reaction to platform terms contaminates the positive tenant evaluation because they exist in the same visual space.",
      "solution": "Use visually distinct surface treatments to create two clear information layers. Layer A (Tenant Quality) uses the white surface token with standard card styling -- it feels familiar, like reviewing an application. Layer B (Platform Terms) uses the bg-deep token background with a distinct section header, creating a clear visual break that signals 'we are now discussing something different.' The transition between layers includes a visual confirmation moment: a summary bar with accent-light background that acknowledges the host's positive tenant evaluation before opening the platform terms layer.

In his 12-year landlord experience, trustworthy financial information comes with a specific visual register: formal, precise, documented.

      "problem": "The payment model -- the single most consequential piece of information for norm-driven hosts -- is introduced as a visual surprise deep in the flow. In John's call, 'guaranteed payments' was mentioned at 01:31 without timing detail, and the actual payment timing did not appear until 05:56. The visual equivalent is a landing page or email that mentions 'guaranteed payments' in a feature list without specifying the mechanism, followed by a detailed payment page deep in the flow that contradicts the host's assumed model. The visual system currently has no mechanism for previewing consequential information early and expanding it progressively. Each appearance of payment information looks identical regardless of its stage in the disclosure sequence.",
      "solution": "Create a three-stage visual rhythm for payment information, where each stage has a distinct visual weight and density that signals its role in the progressive disclosure. Stage 1 (first touch -- email, landing page, first screen): A single-line preview in mono font with the timing included: 'Guaranteed payment within 24 hours of check-in.' This line appears as a compact data pill on an accent-light background, visually distinct from marketing copy but not expanded into a full section. Stage 2 (mid-conversation -- after positive tenant evaluation): A medium-density card with the social norm header, a peer proof card, and a one-sentence summary. Stage 3 (close or detail view): The full three-tier payment section from looks-005. Each stage visually builds on the previous one -- the mono data pill from Stage 1 reappears within Stage 2's card, and Stage 2's card reappears within Stage 3's full layout. This visual consistency means the host never encounters payment information that looks unfamiliar.",

Cialdini's wallet experiment showed a 70% vs. 33% gap based on perceived similarity alone. Currently, there is no standardized visual component for communicating similarity dimensions -- city, experience years, property tier -- in a compact, scannable format. If similarity markers are buried in paragraph text or rendered in the same style as other content, the host must read and interpret them rather than scanning them instantly. The visual system needs a badge system that communicates 'this person is like you' at a glance.",
      "solution": "Create a compact similarity badge row that sits at the top of every peer proof card. Each badge is a pill-shaped element with a mono label on an accent-light background. Standard badge categories: location (e.g., 'NYC'), experience (e.g., '12 yr'), property tier (e.g., '$5K/mo'). The badges are visually identical in style regardless of content, creating a scannable pattern that the host learns to recognize across multiple proof cards. When a badge dimension matches the host's own profile, it receives a stronger visual treatment: accent background with white text instead of accent-light background with accent text.
