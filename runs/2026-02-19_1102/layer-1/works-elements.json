      "problem": "When the platform asks hosts to accept terms that deviate from established industry norms (e.g., payment after first night instead of upfront at lease signing), hosts reject the deviation not because the economics are worse but because no evidence exists that peers like them have accepted it. John explicitly cited collective NYC landlord behavior -- 'what we do in New York city as when you sign the lease, you give the checks' -- as his standard. Without counter-evidence from similar landlords, the platform's rational arguments (guaranteed payments, doubled deposit) are ignored. The agent is left arguing against a social norm with individual persuasion, which Cialdini's research shows is fundamentally ineffective: '95 percent of the people are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.'",
      "solution": "At every moment the platform's model deviates from the host's expected norm, surface evidence that similar hosts have already accepted and benefited from the deviation. 'Similar' must mean similar on the dimensions that matter to the host: geography (NYC), experience level (years of landlording), property value tier, and property type. The evidence must be specific -- named landlords, specific outcomes, concrete numbers -- not generic testimonials. The pattern is: (1) Identify each point where the platform's terms diverge from the host's industry norm. (2) At each divergence point, present social proof from hosts who share at least two demographic dimensions with the current host. (3) Make the proof concrete: 'John M., who has rented his Upper East Side apartment for 8 years, received his first payment within 24 hours of guest check-in.' (4) Surface this proof before the host encounters the divergent term, not after they object.",

          "insight": "John frames his rejection not as personal preference but as collective behavior -- 'what we do in New York city.'

But he rejected the platform's payment terms because they violate his social norms.

(4) State explicitly what will happen at the next touchpoint: 'When I call tomorrow, I will have a specific proposal for how we can structure the payment to work for both of us.'

But hosts like John evaluate payment terms through social norm frameworks, not financial calculations.

The financial advantage could not penetrate the social norm violation. When hosts hear 'you get $6,000 instead of $3,000,' they process the number.

The norm violation triggers a social proof search ('do other landlords do this?'), and when no evidence is found, the norm violation dominates regardless of the financial benefit.",

'Most of our NYC hosts receive their first payment within 24 hours of check-in' positions the payment timing as a social norm rather than a platform policy. (3) Use the host's own norm language.

Introducing it late means the host has already mentally committed to their standard payment expectations and must be 'un-committed' -- a much harder task than setting expectations early.",
      "solution": "Introduce the payment model concept before the host has committed to their default expectations, ideally before or at the very beginning of the evaluation conversation. (1) In pre-call materials (email, text, listing outreach), include a one-line framing: 'Our hosts receive guaranteed payment within 24 hours of guest check-in, backed by Split Lease.' This sets the expectation before the call. (2) In the early minutes of the call, before tenant evaluation begins, briefly mention the payment structure: 'Just so you know how it works, payments are guaranteed and arrive within 24 hours of check-in. I will walk you through the details once we confirm the match is right.' (3) Pair every early mention with social proof: 'This is how our NYC hosts operate -- let me tell you about the match first, and then we will go through the payment details.' The pattern is: seed the concept early so it becomes familiar before the detailed discussion, rather than surprising the host when they have already formed expectations.",

          "insight": "This is the first time John hears about the payment timing -- at minute 5:56 of a call where he has already been evaluating tenants for 4 minutes using his standard framework. By this point, his mental model is locked in: 'these are good tenants, they will pay upfront at signing like everyone does.' The payment model reveal shatters that expectation with no preparation."

          "insight": "The late introduction of the payment model maximizes uncertainty at the worst possible moment. If the concept had been seeded earlier -- when John was still in an open, information-gathering mode -- the uncertainty would have been lower because he would have had time to process it. Cialdini's principle predicts that early, low-stakes exposure to an unfamiliar concept reduces the uncertainty spike when the details are presented later."

          "insight": "Bryant mentions 'guaranteed payments' early (01:31) but does not explain the timing mechanism until 05:56. John hears 'guaranteed payments' and maps it onto his existing framework (upfront at signing). When the actual timing is revealed 4 minutes later, it contradicts what he had assumed. The early mention created a false expectation rather than a correct one."
