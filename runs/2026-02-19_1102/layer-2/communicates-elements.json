      "problem": "When the platform introduces a term that deviates from the host's established industry norm, the host's first reaction is to search for social evidence that peers have accepted it. Currently, no such evidence is presented anywhere in the information flow. John heard 'payment after first night' at minute 5:56 and immediately invoked his 12-year NYC landlord norm: 'what we do in New York city as when you sign the lease, you give the checks.' He ignored the doubled deposit ($6,000 vs. $3,000) entirely because the absence of peer validation for the payment timing made the financial advantage invisible. The information architecture fails because the norm-breaking term is presented without any accompanying social evidence, forcing the host to evaluate an unfamiliar model against a deeply familiar one with no counter-evidence.",
      "solution": "Structure a peer proof card -- a compact information unit containing testimony from a similar host -- that is positioned immediately before or alongside every norm-deviating term. The card must contain: (1) host name and similarity markers (city, experience years, property tier), (2) the specific term they accepted, (3) their concrete outcome (e.g., 'received first payment within 18 hours of check-in'). On screen, the proof card must precede the term explanation. In phone calls, the agent must reference a specific similar host before introducing the deviation. The information hierarchy is: peer evidence first, then the term, then the financial details.",

But when platform terms arrived (05:56 onward), his entire stance shifted to resistant.

Any social proof presented to him must match on this dimension -- he will not be persuaded by testimonials from hosts with 1 year of experience.
