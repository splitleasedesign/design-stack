      "problem": "When the UI transitions to a state that presents a norm-breaking term (payment after first night, deposit matching, non-standard lease structure), the host's immediate reaction is a social proof search: 'do landlords like me accept this?' Currently, the norm-breaking information appears cold -- the state change loads the term without any preceding social evidence. John heard 'payment after first night' at minute 5:56 with zero peer validation, and his response was instant rejection anchored in 12 years of NYC landlord norms: 'what we do in New York city as when you sign the lease, you give the checks.' The interaction pattern fails because the state that displays the deviation does not first load the social evidence that would make the deviation feel familiar.",
      "solution": "Before any UI state that reveals a norm-deviating term, inject a peer proof loading sequence: (1) The screen transitions to a brief peer proof card (looks-001) showing a similar host's acceptance of the same term, animated in with the easing-out token. (2) After a 400ms dwell, the norm-deviating term fades in below or alongside the proof card. (3) The interaction sequence is: trigger -> proof appears -> brief dwell -> term appears. This ensures the host's first perception at the new state is social evidence, not the deviation itself. The proof card must be pre-fetched so the sequence feels instant -- no loading spinner between the proof and the term.",

John was cooperative when evaluating Ariel and Amber (employment, credit, bedroom compatibility) from 02:12 to 03:50, but became resistant when platform payment terms arrived at 05:40. The current interaction flow presents both evaluations as a continuous stream, so a negative reaction to platform terms retroactively poisons the positive tenant assessment.

Phase A (Tenant Evaluation): Present tenant details -- names, employment, credit status, bedroom compatibility, duration.

The gate is a confirmation checkpoint: a summary bar (using accent-light background from looks-002) that asks the host to acknowledge the tenant match before proceeding. The interaction is: host reviews tenants -> host confirms interest -> confirmation is visually banked -> platform terms appear on the new surface (bg-deep from looks-002).
