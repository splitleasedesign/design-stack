Combined insight: phase transitions that introduce norm-breaking terms need BOTH visual continuity (System 1 trust gate) AND peer evidence (social proof). Visual consistency alone fails when the content itself is norm-breaking, as John's call proves -- the conversation was perfectly coherent, but the content violated his social norm.

Combined insight: depletion is not just about volume of decisions but about type mixing. A host who evaluates tenants using familiar criteria (low depletion) and then switches to evaluating unfamiliar platform terms (high depletion) experiences a category-switch cost that is worse than two evaluations of the same type.

The social proof flywheel element (works-005) and peer belonging element (feels-004) are the strongest contributions, but they are hypothetical for John's case. Retention needs a dedicated lens from a host who actually completed a lease cycle."

      "reason": "Layer 1 (works) identified six process patterns, all centered on social proof delivery and information sequencing. However, it does not address the cold-start operational question: what does the platform do RIGHT NOW, before it has any similar-host testimonials? Works-005 (Convert First Successful Hosts into Social Proof Generators) addresses the long-term flywheel, but there is no short-term workaround element for the period when the proof library is empty.",
      "new_input": "Consider adding a process pattern for 'Social Proof Bootstrapping' -- how the agent and platform compensate for empty proof libraries. Options include: agent-as-proxy-proof ('In my experience working with NYC landlords...'), aggregate data proof ('Our NYC hosts average 18-hour payment turnaround'), and aspirational proof ('We are building a network of experienced NYC landlords'). These are weaker than matched testimonials but better than nothing."

      "layer": "3",
      "reason": "Layer 3 (looks) introduced seven visual patterns, all well-specified with tokens, contrast ratios, and hierarchy rules. However, none of the patterns have been tested for mobile responsiveness. The peer proof card (looks-001) at 16px internal padding with three-line content may work on desktop but could feel cramped on mobile. The similarity badge system (looks-007) at 11px mono text may be below comfortable reading size on mobile devices.",
      "new_input": "Re-examine looks elements with mobile viewport constraints. The peer proof card may need a stacked layout on mobile (badges above, outcome below) rather than the inline layout described. The similarity badges may need to increase from 11px to 13px for mobile legibility. All spacing tokens should have responsive variants."

      "layer": "5",
      "reason": "Layer 5 (feels) identified six emotional elements, but the emotional arc has a gap between feels-002 (Tenant Warmth) and feels-001 (Norm Validation Before Disruption). These two elements are designed to work sequentially -- warmth first, then validation before disruption -- but there is no bridging element that carries the tenant warmth INTO the pricing discussion. The current design preserves warmth in a separate container (via behaves-002's confirmation gate) but does not use it as active emotional fuel during the pricing negotiation.",
      "new_input": "Consider adding an emotional element: 'Tenant Warmth as Pricing Anchor.' The idea: when pricing terms are introduced, they should be explicitly framed in terms of the specific tenants the host already likes. Instead of 'payment arrives within 24 hours of check-in,' the framing should be 'payment for Ariel and Amber's first month arrives within 24 hours of their check-in.' Naming the specific tenants in the pricing context carries the emotional warmth across the layer boundary."
