      "problem": "When the platform introduces a term that deviates from the host's established practice, the host's immediate emotional reaction is threat -- a feeling that their competence and judgment are being challenged. John's 12 years of NYC landlord experience represent not just a process but an identity. When Bryant introduced payment after first night, John did not feel confused; he felt dismissed. His response -- 'I've been in this business for a while and what we do in New York city' -- is defensive, not inquisitive. The emotional trajectory goes from businesslike openness to guarded resistance to firm rejection, all within 90 seconds. The platform's current approach introduces the deviation without first honoring the host's existing expertise, which makes the host feel that their years of experience are being overridden rather than built upon.",
      "solution": "Before introducing any term that deviates from the host's established norm, explicitly validate their existing practice as legitimate and well-founded. The emotional sequence must be: 'we respect how you operate' THEN 'here is how landlords like you have expanded on that.' This is not flattery -- it is an acknowledgment that their norm exists for good reasons (which John made explicit: mutual trust, commitment signaling). The host must feel that their expertise is the foundation being built upon, not the obstacle being circumvented. Only after they feel respected as an experienced operator should the alternative model be introduced, framed as an evolution of their practice rather than a replacement of it.",

      "problem": "The host's emotional arc during the call reveals two distinct affective states. From 02:12 to 03:50, John was warm, cooperative, and genuinely interested -- he asked about the tenants' jobs, volunteered his bedroom layout, and engaged in collaborative problem-solving. From 05:40 onward, his affect shifted to guarded, firm, and ultimately dismissive. The warmth evaporated the moment platform mechanics replaced human connection as the topic. The current flow does not protect the warm emotional state generated by tenant evaluation; it allows platform terms to overwrite it. The host goes from feeling like a person evaluating other people to feeling like a party in a transaction -- and the emotional temperature drops sharply.",
      "solution": "Preserve and extend the warmth of tenant evaluation as long as possible before introducing platform mechanics. The host should spend maximum time in the emotional state of 'getting to know these people who might live in my home' and minimum time in the transition to 'reviewing a company's payment terms.' The confirmation checkpoint between these phases (behaves-002) should feel like a moment of human satisfaction -- 'these seem like good people' -- not an administrative gate. Copy, tone, and animation in the tenant evaluation phase should reinforce the interpersonal nature of the match: names, photos where possible, lifestyle details. The platform mechanics phase should open by connecting back to the human match: 'Since Ariel and Amber are a great fit for your space, here is how we make it happen for all of you.'",

John does not know who will do what, by when, or whether his fundamental concern was heard. The emotional state at call's end is not anger or frustration -- it is something worse: dismissiveness. John has categorized the interaction as a non-event. He will return to his standard practice and forget about Split Lease unless a specific commitment re-engages him. The platform's current close creates the emotional equivalent of being told 'someone will get back to you' at a government office -- zero confidence that anything will actually happen.",

This frames the host as a newcomer learning a new system, which is emotionally infantilizing for someone with 12 years of professional experience.

I trust him and they get, trust me too' and 'It depends if they like it, you know, I liked them. Because it's both ways.' For John, every landlord-tenant interaction is an exchange of commitment. When he gives his apartment, he expects an equal commitment in return (upfront payment). When the platform asks him to give (property details, availability, time on the phone) without showing a matching investment in return, the emotional balance tilts. He feels like a supplier being processed, not a partner in a mutual arrangement. The platform's one-directional information extraction (asking questions, collecting data, requesting email) without visible reciprocal investment creates an emotional deficit that accumulates with each unreciprocated action.",
      "solution": "After every meaningful host action, the platform must demonstrate a visible, specific reciprocal commitment. The emotional rhythm should be: host gives, platform gives back, host gives more, platform gives back more. This mirrors the trust-building pattern John expects from his landlord-tenant relationships. The reciprocal commitment must be specific to the host's action -- not a generic thank-you but a concrete statement of what the platform is doing in response. When John shares property details, the platform should show that it is actively matching tenants to his specific space. When he confirms availability, the platform should confirm that Ariel and Amber have been notified. Each reciprocal beat reinforces the 'both ways' relationship John needs to feel.",

His 12 years of practice have given him a deep emotional library of successful upfront-payment transactions. The platform asks him to trust a process he has never experienced, against a process he has experienced hundreds of times. No amount of social proof, rational argument, or financial incentive can fully replace lived experience. Cialdini's infectious helpfulness principle shows that one successful experience creates an emotional cascade: skepticism converts to advocacy. The first successful payment -- arriving within 24 hours as promised -- would be the single most powerful emotional event in the entire host journey.",
      "solution": "Design the first transaction experience to maximize emotional impact. The first payment should arrive with ceremony: a clear notification naming the exact amount, the exact time elapsed since check-in, and a comparison to the guaranteed timeline ('Payment received: $5,000 -- 16 hours after check-in, 8 hours ahead of our 24-hour guarantee'). The emotional message is: 'it worked, exactly as promised, and faster than we said.' This moment converts the host from skeptic to believer, and from believer to potential advocate. After this moment, the platform should immediately invite the host to share their experience -- not as a marketing exercise, but as a completion of the reciprocal relationship: 'You trusted us. It worked. Would you be willing to tell another NYC landlord about your experience?'",
