      "problem": "Taline arrived from a Craigslist ad with zero understanding of the Split Lease model. She invested three minutes of phone conversation before learning her need (full-time rental) did not match the product (part-time stays). Her first question -- 'is it for a certain time?' (0:52) -- reveals that whatever she encountered at discovery communicated nothing about the product category. In a self-service flow, a guest in this state would interact with listing details, search filters, and pricing under a false mental model, making every subsequent interaction meaningless. The system must gate engagement behind category comprehension: the guest must understand what Split Lease IS before any interactive element (search, filter, calendar, price explorer) becomes actionable. Without this gate, the guest builds an expectation scaffold that collapses the moment they discover the mismatch -- and that collapse happens silently as abandonment.",
      "solution": "Implement a category comprehension gate as the first interactive moment on any guest-facing surface. Before the guest can search, filter, or evaluate a listing, the system presents a 3-second interactive category declaration: a static weekly calendar visual (M-F shaded) with the label 'Part-time rental: 2-5 nights per week. Not a full-time lease.' The guest acknowledges comprehension through a single action -- tapping 'This could work for me' or 'I need something different.' The 'something different' path does not reject the guest; it redirects to the mismatch-to-alternative bridge (see behaves-003). The 'this could work' path unlocks the full search and evaluation flow. This gate ensures every subsequent interaction -- search, filter, calendar, pricing -- is built on a correct mental model. The gate appears once per session and is remembered across sessions via local storage or account state.",

      "problem": "Taline could not understand the Split Lease model through verbal explanation, but understood it instantly when Bryant offered a concrete pattern: 'five nights a week' (3:21). She immediately mapped it to her life: 'five nights and then I can do the weekends at my mom' (3:37). Comprehension arrived through a specific, manipulable example -- not through a definition. Furthermore, when she asked 'how much would it cost' (2:51), she received no answer because pricing depends on the specific pattern chosen. These two problems -- model comprehension and pricing opacity -- are the same problem: the guest needs to interact with a concrete stay pattern and see what it costs, in real time, before she can evaluate whether this arrangement works for her life. Currently, this exploration requires a human phone call. The interaction pattern must make this exploration self-service.",
      "solution": "Implement a stay pattern builder as the primary interactive element on every listing evaluation page. The builder is a horizontal row of 7 tappable day blocks (M T W T F S S) where the guest selects which nights they want to stay. As the guest taps nights on and off, an estimated monthly cost updates in real time beside or below the calendar row. Default state: M-F pre-selected (the most common pattern). The cost display shows '~$X/month (estimated)' using the listing's nightly rate range and the selected number of nights. The guest can also adjust duration (number of weeks or months) via a simple stepper control below the calendar. Every change to pattern or duration instantly recalculates the cost estimate. This single component replaces both the verbal model explanation and the pricing conversation -- the guest learns the model by using it and gets a price signal by configuring it.",

The interaction survived only because (a) Bryant immediately suggested an alternative ('five nights a week,' 3:21) and (b) Taline was resilient enough to adapt in real time under pressure. In a self-service flow, the rejection moment is where the guest clicks away. Standard interaction patterns for constraint violations use error states -- red borders, warning banners, disabled buttons -- all of which communicate 'you did something wrong.' But the guest did nothing wrong; the mismatch is a product-category issue, not a user error. The interaction must redirect without rejecting, presenting the constraint and the alternative as a single, atomic action.",

Instead, it produces a bridge state: the mismatched selection remains visible (acknowledging the guest's intent), a constraint message appears in warm amber (not red), and a concrete alternative appears simultaneously in accent green with an interactive calendar pre-configured to the nearest viable pattern and its estimated cost. The alternative is actionable: the guest can tap 'Try this pattern' to instantly load the alternative into the pattern builder. The entire bridge sequence -- detection, display, alternative -- must complete within 400ms. The guest's mismatched selection is never deleted; it remains visible but visually de-emphasized, so the guest sees both what they wanted and what is available in the same view.",

She has a lease ending, needs to move by December 15th, has two jobs and a child whose school commute determines where she can live. She does not have time or cognitive bandwidth for exploratory browsing. She needs three answers: (1) can I move in by my date, (2) can I afford it, (3) does it work for my commute. The standard interaction sequence -- browse listings, read descriptions, explore amenities, then check price and availability -- forces the urgent guest through a sequence optimized for casual exploration. Every interaction step that does not answer one of her three critical questions is friction that pushes her toward abandoning the platform and returning to Craigslist. The interaction sequence must adapt to urgency, front-loading the decision-critical interactions and deferring exploratory ones.",

Instead of the standard listing page flow (photos, description, amenities, then price/availability), the urgent flow presents three tappable answer cards above the fold: (1) 'Available from [date]' with a green check or amber warning, (2) 'Estimated: ~$X/month' with the pattern builder inline, and (3) 'X min to your work' if the guest provided a work location. These cards are interactive: tapping the availability card opens a calendar, tapping the cost card opens the pattern builder, tapping the commute card opens a map. Below these cards, the standard listing content is available for guests who want to explore further. The interaction model is: answer the three critical questions first, then offer depth. The guest can toggle between 'Essentials' and 'Full details' modes at any time.",

I don't want to stay at my mom because my job for me to commute and have to pick up my son from school,' 4:14-4:41). The emotional arc was: hope, rejection, scramble, tentative recovery. This arc worked because Taline is resilient and Bryant is skilled. The platform cannot depend on either. In a self-service flow, the negotiation interaction must guide the guest through the adaptation process without requiring resilience, improvisation, or emotional disclosure. The interaction must present the space of possibilities and let the guest navigate it, rather than presenting a binary (accepted/rejected) and asking the guest to generate alternatives unassisted.",

The guest can select any pre-configured option or customize their own pattern using the pattern builder (behaves-002). Each option shows social proof when available: 'Most popular pattern' or '12 guests chose this.' The explorer does not ask the guest WHY they want a particular pattern -- no emotional justification is required. The guest selects what works for their life; the system calculates the cost. If none of the options work, a 'None of these work for me' path leads to a contact-agent action, not a dead end.
