      "problem": "Taline responded to a Craigslist ad believing she was contacting a standard full-time rental listing. She had zero understanding of Split Lease's model -- part-time repeat stays, multi-local guests, variable nightly pricing. Her very first substantive question ('is it for a certain time?' at 0:52) reveals she has no framework for the product she is engaging with. She learned the model did not match her need only after investing time in a phone call, at which point Bryant told her 'unfortunately I won't be able to help you with that... he's not interested in full-time rentals' (3:09). This is a miscommunication that spans discovery through evaluation: the guest believes she is evaluating one product category (traditional rental) while the platform offers another (part-time shared arrangement). The d.school book identifies this exact pattern: 'What the students thought might be the need and what they actually found turned out to be two very different things' (line 86). The current process relies on a human phone call to surface the mismatch, which means guests who never call -- or who hang up when confused -- are permanently lost.",
      "solution": "Surface the product category clearly at every guest touchpoint before evaluation begins. This means: (1) Any external listing (Craigslist, social media, referral link) must state in the first line what Split Lease IS and what it is NOT. 'Part-time rental: 2-5 nights per week. Not a full-time lease.' The guest should self-select or self-exclude before investing time. (2) The first screen a guest sees on the platform should explain the model in 10 words or fewer with a visual (e.g., a calendar showing a M-F pattern). The guest must understand the category before seeing any specific listing. (3) If a guest's stated need does not match the model (e.g., they indicate 'full-time, 7 nights/week'), the platform should immediately explain the mismatch AND suggest how the model could still work for them -- mimicking what Bryant did when he suggested M-F stays. Do not just reject; redirect. (4) The miscommunication resolution must happen in under 30 seconds, not over a 3-minute phone conversation.",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "negotiation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Taline's journey survived the product-category mismatch only because she improvised an adaptation in real time: she shifted from 'full-time' (3:02) to 'Monday through Friday' (3:53) to 'five nights and then I can do the weekends at my mom' (3:37) in under 60 seconds. This adaptation was catalyzed entirely by human conversation -- Bryant mentioned 'five nights a week' as an example (3:21), and Taline connected it to her own situation. Without this human prompt, she had no way to see that her need could be reshaped to fit the model. The platform currently has no mechanism to support this adaptation. A self-service flow would present the listing as-is, and a guest whose stated need does not match would simply leave. The d.school book describes this as entering a situation 'without being fixed on the exact problem they would tackle' (line 86), but Taline WAS fixed on her problem (full-time housing) until Bryant's suggestion opened a new frame. The platform must provide this reframing without requiring a human agent.",
      "solution": "When a guest's stated need does not perfectly match a listing or the platform model, present structured alternatives that help the guest see how their need could be reshaped. This means: (1) If a guest indicates 7-night/week need, immediately show: 'Many guests stay Monday-Friday and spend weekends elsewhere. Would this work for you?' with a cost comparison (5-night vs. 7-night pricing elsewhere). (2) Present adaptation as a benefit, not a compromise. Taline's adaptation saved her money and gave her weekends with family. Frame alternatives around the guest's actual life context, not around the platform's constraints. (3) Provide a 'stay pattern builder' where the guest can drag nights on a weekly calendar and see how different patterns affect pricing. This is the digital equivalent of Bryant's conversational suggestion. (4) Show real examples: 'Guests like you typically stay M-F for work and go home on weekends. Here is what that costs.'

      "problem": "Taline's most direct evaluation question -- 'So I just want to know how much would it cost' (2:51) -- could not be answered during the call. Bryant said 'I have sort of a general idea, but not exact, just because typically these nightly pricing will be set specific on the situation' (5:33-5:50). The single most important piece of information for a budget-constrained guest with two jobs and a child is deferred to a future conversation between the agent and the host. Taline cannot evaluate, cannot compare, cannot decide, and cannot plan. She is left in a state of information limbo where she has invested time and adapted her needs but cannot complete the most basic evaluation: can I afford this? The d.school book emphasizes that learning comes through 'the experience of trying, and failing, and trying again' (line 32), but Taline has no mechanism to try -- she cannot see any price point to react to, test against her budget, or use as a basis for negotiation.",
      "solution": "Provide indicative pricing at every stage before exact pricing is confirmed. This means: (1) On every listing or external ad, show a price range: '$X-$Y per night depending on your schedule.' The range does not need to be exact; it needs to be informative enough for the guest to determine if this is in their budget universe. (2) When a guest specifies their pattern (e.g., M-F, starting Dec 15), immediately show an estimated monthly cost based on typical rates for similar arrangements. Label it clearly: 'Estimated cost: $X/month for 5 nights/week. Final pricing confirmed after host review.' (3) Build a pricing calculator that lets the guest adjust nights-per-week and duration and see how the estimated cost changes in real time. This is the 'tinkering' the d.school book advocates -- the guest can experiment with configurations before committing to a proposal. (4) Never leave a guest without a price signal. Even 'similar stays in this area cost $60-$90/night' is better than 'pricing will be set specific on the situation.'",

(3) While waiting for the host's response, show the guest other potentially matching listings in the area: 'While we confirm this listing, here are 2 other options in North Bergen that fit your M-F pattern.' This keeps the guest engaged with the platform rather than returning to Craigslist. (4) Set an SLA for agent response and communicate it clearly: 'Bryant will respond within 24 hours.

These are not preferences -- they are hard constraints that determine whether any arrangement is viable. Bryant learned some of this through conversation, but the platform has no mechanism to capture, store, or use this information.

      "problem": "Taline experienced the negotiation phase as a sequence of rejection and self-rescue. First, her primary need was rejected ('unfortunately I won't be able to help you with that,' 3:09). Then she had to invent an alternative under pressure, in real time, with no support ('And I just do it like Monday through Friday,' 3:53). Then she had to justify her adaptation with emotional vulnerability ('I just really need a place,' 4:14; 'I don't want to stay at my mom because my job for me to commute and have to pick up my son from school far from me,' 4:25-4:41). The emotional arc was: hope, rejection, scramble, tentative recovery. This worked only because (a) Taline is resilient and motivated, and (b) Bryant is a skilled conversationalist who caught her adapted need and validated it. The platform cannot rely on guest resilience or agent skill. The d.school book notes that 'the product is important, but how to get there deserves at least as much attention, if not more' (line 33). The negotiation PROCESS shaped Taline's experience as much as the outcome will.",
      "solution": "Redesign negotiation as a supported, exploratory process rather than a binary accept/reject interaction. This means: (1) Never present a flat rejection without a simultaneous alternative. Instead of 'this listing is not available for full-time stays,' show 'this listing is available for 2-5 night/week stays. Here is what that looks like for you.' (2) Use progressive disclosure in negotiation: start with what IS possible, then let the guest narrow from there. Show the full range of stay patterns available for a listing, let the guest select or customize, and calculate pricing for each option. (3) Provide emotional framing that normalizes adaptation: 'Most guests in your area stay M-F and spend weekends elsewhere. Here is how they describe the arrangement.' Use social proof to make the adapted pattern feel normal, not like settling. (4) Preserve the guest's dignity throughout. Taline had to explain her childcare situation and financial pressure to justify her needs. The platform should never require emotional justification for a stay pattern. A guest selects M-F; the platform does not need to know why.",

          "insight": "The negotiation arc from rejection to adaptation took ~45 seconds of human conversation. It succeeded because Bryant suggested an alternative and Taline was resilient enough to accept it. A platform flow must achieve the same outcome without depending on either agent skill or guest resilience."
