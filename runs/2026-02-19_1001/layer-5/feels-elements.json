      "problem": "Taline arrived from a Craigslist ad with zero understanding of what Split Lease is. Her first question -- 'is it for a certain time?' (0:52) -- reveals she cannot even categorize the product. She is driving home in traffic, under time pressure, and the conceptual fog of not knowing what she is looking at generates anxiety layered on top of her already-urgent housing stress. The d.school book describes this state: 'when faced with an open-ended challenge that doesn't have one fixed, right solution, we can all feel like beginners' (line 80). Taline is a beginner in a product category she has never encountered, and her emotional state is a volatile mix of urgency and disorientation. Every second she spends confused is a second closer to abandoning the interaction entirely.",
      "solution": "The first emotional beat of the guest journey must convert disorientation into calm comprehension within three seconds. The product-category signal -- visual calendar badge plus plain-language label -- must feel like an answer arriving, not like more information to process. The tone is: 'Here is exactly what this is. You can decide right now if it fits.' The emotional principle is oriented certainty: the guest should feel, within the first visual scan, that she knows what she is looking at and can make her next decision. No mystery, no discovery arc, no brand storytelling -- just a clear, warm, factual declaration that resolves the confusion before it compounds.",

          "insight": "Taline's first substantive utterance is a plea for orientation. She is not asking about price or location -- she is asking what kind of thing this is. The emotional need at discovery is not excitement or curiosity; it is the calm that comes from knowing."

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "negotiation"],
      "problem": "When Bryant told Taline 'unfortunately I won't be able to help you with that... he's not interested in full-time rentals' (3:09), Taline experienced a rejection of her primary need. The emotional arc that followed was: deflation, scramble to self-adapt, and then vulnerable self-justification ('I just really need a place... I don't want to stay at my mom because my job for me to commute and have to pick up my son from school,' 4:14-4:41). She disclosed her financial stress, her childcare logistics, and her family situation in order to justify why she needed to be accommodated. This emotional labor should never be required by a platform. The d.school book says: 'We're hard on work but soft on people, and we don't confuse kindness with weakness' (line 43). The rejection moment is where the platform's emotional character is revealed -- and currently it requires the guest to absorb a 'no' and generate her own recovery.",
      "solution": "The emotional principle for every mismatch moment is: the guest must never feel rejected. The constraint is communicated with factual clarity, but the alternative is the emotionally dominant signal. The guest's eye, attention, and feelings should land on what IS possible, not on what is not. The tone is: 'This is what works here, and here is how it can work for you.' The redirect must feel like a door opening, not a door closing. Copy, visual weight, and animation timing must all prioritize the alternative over the constraint. The guest should feel that the platform understood her need and found a way to meet it -- even if the way is different from what she initially requested.",

The emotional damage happens in the gap between this rejection and Bryant's suggestion of an alternative 12 seconds later. In a self-service UI, that 12-second gap is where the guest leaves."

For a guest with two jobs and a child, working under a lease deadline, pricing is not curiosity -- it is the variable that determines whether she can move out of her mother's house. The emotional effect of pricing opacity is helplessness: the guest cannot plan, cannot compare, cannot decide. She is dependent on a callback from an agent who may or may not come. The d.school book argues that understanding comes from 'the experience of trying, and failing, and trying again' (line 32) -- but Taline has nothing to try. She cannot experiment with configurations, see how costs change, or test whether this arrangement fits her budget. The emotional state is powerlessness dressed up as 'we will get back to you.'",
      "solution": "The emotional principle for pricing interactions is: the guest must always feel she has a number to work with. Even an imprecise range is emotionally superior to silence. The pricing experience must feel like the guest is in control -- she manipulates the pattern, sees the cost respond, and can make a budget decision. The tone is: 'You decide what works for your budget.' The interactive pricing calculator transforms the guest from a passive price-taker waiting for a callback into an active explorer who is building her own arrangement.

The emotional state this creates is: hopeful but unmoored. She has invested time, adapted her needs, disclosed personal circumstances, and now she is released into a void with no confirmation, no timeline, no status visibility, and no way to track progress. For a guest whose lease is ending and whose child's school commute depends on where she lives, this wait is not neutral -- it is actively anxiety-producing.

The tone is: 'We have your details. Here is exactly where things stand. We will reach out by [time].' The emotional architecture converts an unstructured anxiety-producing void into a structured, visible, forward-moving process.

The risk is that this adaptation feels like settling -- accepting less because the platform could not give her what she wanted. If the adapted arrangement feels like a compromise, the guest carries resentment into the active lease. The d.school book describes the productive version of this adaptation: entering a situation 'without being fixed on the exact problem they would tackle' (line 86). But the d.school students had coaching and support; Taline adapted under pressure, alone, with no framing that her adaptation was anything other than accepting less.",

The guest who shifts from 7 nights to 5 nights should feel she found an arrangement that fits her life more precisely -- she saves money on weeknights and has weekends free. The tone is: 'You found the pattern that fits your actual life.' Copy, pricing display, and social proof must all reinforce that the adapted pattern is the smart, popular, life-aligned choice -- not the fallback after the preferred option was unavailable.

The d.school book notes: 'the search for an apartment in a new city' is one of those open-ended challenges that makes us all 'feel like beginners' (line 80).
