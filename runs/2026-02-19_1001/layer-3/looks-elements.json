      "problem": "Taline encountered a Craigslist ad and had zero visual signal that this listing was a fundamentally different product category from a traditional rental. Bryant spent 45 seconds verbally explaining the model (1:06-1:51) and Taline still did not understand it -- she immediately asked for full-time pricing (2:03-3:02). The verbal medium failed because the concept is spatial and temporal. Every guest touchpoint currently relies on text to explain a concept that text cannot efficiently convey. Without a distinct, instantly recognizable visual identity for the product category, guests enter the funnel with a false mental model and drop out when reality collides with expectation.",
      "solution": "Create a signature visual category badge that appears as the first element on every guest touchpoint -- external ads, landing pages, listing cards, and listing detail pages. The badge combines a compact weekly calendar icon (7 squares, with the active nights filled in accent green) alongside a plain-language label in mono type: 'Part-time rental: 2-5 nights/week.' The badge uses the accent color on the warm background to create instant visual distinction from every other rental listing the guest has seen. The mono typeface signals factual precision; the calendar icon makes the temporal concept spatial. The badge must be the first visual element in the scan path -- above the listing photo, above the price, above the location. It is the visual gateway: everything that follows is interpreted through the frame it establishes.",

This concept is inherently visual and spatial, yet the current guest experience relies entirely on verbal and textual explanation.

At discovery: a static 7-day row with Monday-Friday filled in accent green and Saturday-Sunday empty, labeled 'Most guests stay like this.'

At proposal creation: a confirmed version showing the agreed pattern with exact pricing. The component is always a single horizontal row of 7 day blocks -- never a monthly grid at first encounter. Each block is a rounded rectangle (radius-sm: 6px) with the day initial inside. Active nights use accent fill with white text; inactive nights use bg-deep fill with ink-muted text.

The guest who most needs pricing information -- budget-constrained, with two jobs and a child, under a move-by deadline -- is the one left with zero visual price signal. Pricing opacity is not just an information problem; it is a visual hierarchy problem. Listing pages currently give visual prominence to photos, location, and amenities while deferring pricing to human mediation. The visual hierarchy does not match the guest's evaluation priority: for a guest like Taline, price is primary, everything else is secondary.",

Tier 1 (Search/Discovery): A per-night price range displayed in mono type on every listing card -- e.g., '$55-$85/night.' The range sits in the top-right of the listing card, opposite the category badge in the top-left, creating a visual frame that the listing photo sits between. Tier 2 (Listing Evaluation): When the guest sets a stay pattern using the calendar component, an estimated monthly total appears in larger mono type below the calendar -- e.g., '~$1,400/mo.' The tilde and 'estimated' label use ink-muted to signal imprecision. The number itself uses ink at full weight to signal importance. Tier 3 (Proposal): The confirmed price replaces the estimate, visually signaled by a subtle accent-light background panel and the removal of the tilde. A small 'Confirmed by host' badge in accent/mono appears beside the price.

There is no visual design pattern that simultaneously communicates a constraint and its resolution as a single perceptual unit.

The visual structure uses a vertical stepper with 4-5 labeled steps, where the current step is visually highlighted. The stepper uses accent fill for completed steps, accent-bright for the current step, and bg-deep for future steps. Below the stepper, a summary card shows the guest's captured request in structured fields: 'Pattern: Mon-Fri', 'Start date: Dec 15', 'Area: North Bergen / Union City', 'Estimated cost: $55-$85/night.' Each field uses a label in ink-muted (Outfit) and a value in ink (IBM Plex Mono for data-like values, Outfit for text). The 'Next Step' is the visually heaviest element: it appears at the top in a surface-warm panel with accent left-border, using Outfit 16px/600 for the step description and a timeline ('Bryant will respond within 24 hours'). The status page is a single, scannable screen -- no tabs, no scrolling past the fold for essential information.",

The standard visual layout of a listing page -- hero photo, description, amenities, location, then price and availability -- does not match her evaluation priorities. She needs three answers in rapid sequence: (1) available by her deadline, (2) within budget, (3) works for her commute. The visual hierarchy of a standard listing page buries these answers below content that an urgent guest does not care about (photos, amenity lists, host bio). The listing page treats all guests the same, but an urgent guest scans with fundamentally different priorities than a browsing guest.",

(2) Cost card: the estimated monthly total in IBM Plex Mono 18px/700. (3) Commute card: 'X min to your work' in Outfit 14px/600 (if the guest provided a work location). These three cards sit in a single row above the listing photo. They use surface background with a subtle shadow-sm and accent-left-border for available/compatible signals, or signal-warn-left-border for warnings.
