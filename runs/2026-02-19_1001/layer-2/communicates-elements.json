Her very first substantive question -- 'is it for a certain time?' (0:52) -- reveals she could not even categorize the listing. She believed she was responding to a standard full-time rental. The listing detail (location, price, photos) is meaningless if the guest does not first understand the product category. Information was structured detail-first with no category label, causing Taline to invest three minutes of phone conversation before learning this was not a traditional rental. When information hierarchy fails at the category level, all downstream evaluation is built on a false premise.",
      "solution": "Structure every guest-facing touchpoint so the product category label appears before any listing detail. The first piece of information a guest encounters -- whether on a Craigslist ad, a social media post, or a landing page -- must be a plain-language category statement: 'Part-time rental: 2-5 nights per week. Not a full-time lease.' This label must precede the address, the price, the photos, and every other detail. The category label is the root node of the information hierarchy; without it, every child node is misinterpreted.",

Bryant could only say 'I have sort of a general idea, but not exact, just because typically these nightly pricing will be set specific on the situation' (5:33-5:50). Pricing is the single most important variable for a budget-constrained guest making a life decision, yet the information architecture provides zero pricing information at search, zero at listing evaluation, and defers it entirely to a future agent-host conversation. The guest is asked to invest time, adapt her needs, and wait for a callback -- all before seeing a single number. This is an information sequencing failure: the guest needs pricing information early (to decide whether to proceed), but the system provides it late (after human mediation).",
      "solution": "Structure pricing information into three progressive tiers that match the guest's decision journey. Tier 1 (Search/Discovery): Show a per-night price range on every listing or ad -- e.g., '$55-$85/night depending on schedule.' This is imprecise but sufficient for budget qualification. Tier 2 (Listing Evaluation): When a guest specifies a stay pattern (e.g., M-F, 8 weeks), show an estimated monthly total based on the range midpoint with a clear 'estimate' label -- e.g., 'Estimated: ~$1,400/month for 5 nights/week. Final price confirmed by host.' Tier 3 (Proposal): Show the exact host-confirmed price for the specific arrangement. Each tier adds precision, but the guest always has a price signal to work with. The guest never encounters a stage where the answer to 'how much?' is 'I do not know yet.'",

      "problem": "The Split Lease model is difficult to explain in words. Bryant spent from 1:06 to 1:51 (45 seconds) trying to describe it verbally: 'repeat renters or multi local guests... part of the week each week, part of the month each month, any sort of like irregular repeat stay... like a hybrid worker... Monday to Friday each week as an example... couple of weeks a month.' Despite this verbal explanation, Taline still responded with 'what I'm really looking for something for like two months... my full time' (2:03-3:02), indicating the verbal explanation did not land. The concept is spatial and temporal -- it is about which nights of the week you are there and which you are not. Text and speech are poor media for conveying temporal patterns. The information architecture relies on the wrong modality (words) for a concept that is inherently visual (a calendar pattern).",
      "solution": "Present the stay pattern as an interactive weekly calendar visual at every point where the model needs to be understood. The visual shows a 7-day week with selectable night blocks. Default state: Monday through Friday shaded (the most common pattern). The guest can tap/click to add or remove nights and see the estimated cost update in real time. This visual replaces the verbal explanation ('part of the week, each week') with a direct spatial representation. At discovery, the visual is static and illustrative ('This is how Split Lease works: [M-F shaded calendar]'). At listing evaluation, the visual becomes interactive ('Select your nights'). At proposal creation, the visual confirms the selected pattern ('Your stay: Mon-Fri, starting Dec 15').",

      "problem": "Taline is under acute time pressure: her lease is ending, she needs to move by December 15th, she is calling while driving home from work in traffic (0:35), and she has a child whose school commute depends on where she lives. The information architecture presents information in the same sequence regardless of the guest's urgency level. But an urgent guest needs different information first than a browsing guest. Taline does not need to understand the Split Lease philosophy, read host bios, or explore amenity photos. She needs three things in rapid sequence: (1) Can this work for my situation? (2) Can I afford it? (3) How fast can I move in? The current architecture buries these answers behind verbal explanations, pricing opacity, and agent-mediated timelines. An urgent guest with a concrete deadline processes information in a fundamentally different scan pattern than a casual explorer.",
      "solution": "Detect or allow guests to self-declare urgency, and restructure the information hierarchy accordingly. When a guest indicates urgency (e.g., 'I need to move by [date]' or selects 'I need housing soon' in a form), the information sequence shifts: (1) Availability and move-in date come first ('Available from Dec 10. Move-in possible within 48 hours of confirmation.'). (2) Price estimate comes second ('Estimated: $65/night for Mon-Fri stays, ~$1,400/month.'). (3) Location compatibility comes third ('12 min from [guest's workplace].'). (4) Property details come fourth (photos, amenities, house rules). For non-urgent guests, the default sequence (property details, model explanation, pricing exploration) is preserved. The architecture adapts its disclosure order to the guest's context.",
