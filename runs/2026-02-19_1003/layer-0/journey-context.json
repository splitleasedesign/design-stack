He asked about storing personal items (prompted by the agent's mention at 2:10-2:20: 'you're able to store your stuff in between stays, like toiletries and monitors and whatever you need there'), and this storage detail was important enough that the agent proactively raised it. Vince's move-in experience will be defined by whether reality matches the mental model built during the call: a space that is '100 percent yours' when he is there, where his stuff is waiting, with a kitchen he can use. Krug's principle that 'making pages self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better' (Ch.1, p.19) applies directly to the House Manual and check-in instructions. First-time move-in is the moment when the listing's promises become physical reality.

The agent acknowledged this is common: 'thinking of the days you need with the backing up to the nights, that isn't completely understandable' (6:43-6:56).

Krug Ch.1 (p.15): 'the fact that the people who built the site didn't care enough to make things obvious — and easy — can erode our confidence in the site and its publishers.'
