      "problem": "When Vince landed on the Nolita listing page, the page loaded with a conventional layout (photos, location, amenities) and he scanned it using the same mental model he uses for Airbnb or Craigslist. The service concept -- ghost roommate, exclusive-when-there, personal storage -- was either absent or buried below the fold. By the time the page finished loading and Vince finished scanning, he had already formed three wrong mental models (hotel, cleaning-out arrangement, multiple occupants). The page's default state failed to communicate the most important information before the user's first scan completed. This is an interaction timing problem: the service concept explainer must be visible and comprehensible in the same window of time the user spends on their first scan (under 5 seconds), which means it must be part of the initial render, not a lazy-loaded or scroll-revealed element.",
      "solution": "The service concept explainer block must be rendered as part of the initial page paint -- above the fold, before the photo gallery, and without any scroll-to-reveal or fade-in animation that delays comprehension. The block should appear in its complete state on first render (no skeleton loader, no progressive reveal). If the page is loading slowly, the concept explainer should be in the first content paint while photos and amenities load asynchronously below. This inverts the conventional pattern where photos load first and descriptions load later. For this novel service, comprehension must precede visual appeal. On subsequent visits by the same user, the concept explainer can collapse to a compact reminder ('Shared apartment, separate schedules') since the mental model is already formed, with an expand affordance if the user wants the full explainer.",

      "problem": "When Vince selected his schedule during the call, he initially said 'Monday, Tuesday' (his office days) before correcting himself to 'Sunday, Monday' (the stay nights he actually needs). The agent caught the error only because a human was present. On a digital form, this translation error would produce a silent wrong booking. The interaction problem is that the platform's schedule input accepts nights as the primary input when the guest's mental model is office days. The feedback loop between input and outcome is missing: when Vince enters 'Monday, Tuesday' on a nights-based form, nothing tells him that he has booked the wrong nights until after submission. The interaction pattern must provide real-time bidirectional translation so the guest sees the consequence of their input before committing.",
      "solution": "The schedule input component accepts office days as the primary input mode. As the guest taps each office day on a weekly calendar strip, the corresponding stay night highlights simultaneously with a 120ms spring-eased animation, providing instant visual feedback that the translation is happening. The derived stay nights appear below the office-day input in a secondary visual treatment, updating in real time as the guest adds or removes office days. A one-line bridge sentence appears on first use: 'In the office Mon-Tue means you arrive Sunday night.' The monthly cost updates live as nights are added or removed, using IBM Plex Mono with a number-morphing animation (each digit transitions independently at 150ms with easing-out) so the cost change is noticed but not disruptive. The entire interaction is reversible: tapping an office day again removes it and its corresponding night, with the same spring animation in reverse.",

The callout content adapts per phase: at proposal submission, 'This is your starting schedule -- adjust anytime after move-in'; at lease signing, 'Your arrangement includes built-in flexibility. Change your schedule with one week notice'; at schedule change confirmation, 'You can change again anytime.' The callout uses the signal-info color palette (calm blue, not warning amber).

When Vince encounters this tool in the app weeks later, he will have a vague memory at best. Krug's muddling-through principle predicts he will attempt to use the tool based on incomplete understanding, and if it is confusing, he will default to texting the agent instead. The interaction challenge is twofold: (1) the tool must be discoverable on the active lease dashboard without the guest knowing it exists, and (2) the tool must be usable on first encounter without instructions. Additionally, because schedule changes affect monthly cost, the guest needs to see the financial impact of their change before committing to it -- an interaction that was handled verbally in the call when the agent said 'I'd have to get back to you' about pricing.",

A clearly labeled 'Change my schedule' button sits directly below the calendar strip in accent color.

As the guest taps office days, the corresponding stay nights toggle with a 120ms spring-eased animation, and a live cost display below updates with a number-morphing animation showing the new monthly total alongside the current total, with the difference highlighted in accent (increase) or signal-info (decrease).

Your information is saved -- try again.' The guest's input is preserved in the form so they do not have to re-enter anything.

The status tracker steps activate sequentially as the proposal progresses, with each step's activation using a subtle left-to-right fill animation (200ms) that communicates progress.
