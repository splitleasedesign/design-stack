      "problem": "Vince arrives at the platform cautiously curious but completely confused about what the service even is. His cascade of wrong mental models at 1:19-1:33 ('Is it like a hotel? Multiple people throughout the week where you clean everything out?') is not just a comprehension failure -- it is an emotional event. Each wrong guess increases anxiety and erodes the fragile exploratory openness he brought to the page. Krug's First Law says pages should be self-evident, but the emotional consequence of violating this law is specific: confusion does not feel neutral -- it feels like the platform is hiding something, or is too complicated for a normal person, or is not legitimate. Vince's polite apology at 0:04 ('Sorry about this') reveals he is already managing slight social anxiety; adding concept confusion on top of that creates a compounding emotional burden that makes every subsequent interaction feel harder than it should.",
      "solution": "The first 5 seconds of any page a guest lands on must produce a single, unmistakable emotional response: 'Oh, I get it.' This is not just about information architecture -- it is about the feeling of instant recognition replacing the feeling of confusion. The service concept explainer must be designed not merely to inform but to calm: warm surface background, unhurried Instrument Serif typography, a 3-panel illustration that shows the time-split model with the visual rhythm of a story ('your nights / their nights / your stuff stays'). The tone should feel like a trusted friend explaining something simple, not like a startup pitching something novel. The copy must pass the 'next-door neighbor' test from Krug: if Vince's neighbor could read it and say 'Oh, it is a shared apartment with separate schedules,' the tone is right. Every word that sounds like marketing ('hybrid living solution,' 'innovative platform') undermines the calm by signaling that the platform is trying to sell rather than explain.",

          "insight": "This is not just confusion -- it is escalating anxiety performed aloud. Each wrong guess ('hotel,' 'cleaning out,' 'multiple people') increases Vince's uncertainty.

His schedule is unconfirmed (0:39: 'I'm still waiting on them to make things official'). He asks about reducing to one night per week before he even asks about price (5:06-5:25). His employer has not finalized his office days, meaning his entire housing need is provisional. Every commitment point -- viewing a listing, creating a proposal, signing a lease -- is shadowed by the question 'What if things change?' This is not a rational calculation about flexibility terms; it is an emotional state of anxiety about loss of control. Vince is starting a new job, commuting from Connecticut, navigating a service he has never used, and dealing with an employer who 'is not communicating well' (2:45). He is already managing multiple sources of uncertainty. Adding housing inflexibility to this stack would be the emotional tipping point that prevents commitment.",

The language should not describe what the platform can do ('Our flexible scheduling feature allows...'); it should directly address the guest's fear ('You are not locked in. Change your schedule anytime.'). The emotional register is reassurance, not salesmanship. The flexibility callout should appear adjacent to every commitment button (Submit Proposal, Sign Lease, Confirm Schedule) using the signal-info (calm blue) palette -- never amber or red, which signal warning or danger. On touch devices where hover is not available, the callout should be permanently visible near the commitment action. The content should become more specific as the guest progresses: general assurance at listing evaluation, specific mechanism at proposal creation, concrete terms at acceptance, and the actual tool at active lease. Each phase adds precision, but the core emotional message never changes: 'You are safe to commit because you can change later.'",

The agent gently corrected him and acknowledged this is a common confusion (6:43-6:56). But on a digital form, there is no gentle correction -- there is only a wrong input that produces a wrong booking, or a validation error that makes the guest feel stupid. The days-to-nights translation is not a knowledge gap; it is a mental model mismatch between how guests think ('office days') and how the platform speaks ('booking nights'). Every time the platform forces the guest to translate between these models, it creates a micro-moment of feeling incompetent -- 'Am I doing this right?' -- that accumulates across the journey. Krug's observation that 'people don't like to puzzle over how to do things' has an emotional dimension: puzzling makes people feel inadequate. For a first-time user of a novel service, feeling inadequate is the fastest path to abandonment.",

The live cost update uses number-morphing animation that makes budget impact immediately visible. The one-line bridge sentence on first use ('In the office Mon-Tue means you arrive Sunday night') should feel like a friendly aside, not a correction. The emotional principle is: the platform does the thinking so the guest does not have to.

      "problem": "Vince found one listing in Nolita and reached out about it without browsing alternatives (1:02-1:07). When told it might not be available, he pivoted instantly (3:52-4:02). This satisficing behavior -- choosing the first reasonable option -- is not lazy; it is efficient. But satisficing is emotionally fragile: if the first match fails and no alternative appears immediately, the guest loses the forward momentum that brought them to the platform. The emotional trajectory of a satisficing guest is: curiosity ('this looks right') to action ('let me reach out') to momentum ('things are moving'). If the listing is unavailable and the platform shows a dead-end state, that momentum collapses into deflation: 'Well, I tried.' Krug notes that 'optimizing is hard and it takes a long time' -- and emotionally, being forced to optimize after satisficing feels like punishment for having found something good. The guest expected to move forward, not to start over.",
      "solution": "Every search interaction must maintain forward momentum, even when the first match fails. The emotional design principle is: never let the guest feel like they have reached a dead end. When a listing is unavailable, the muting of the old listing and promotion of the alternative must happen simultaneously -- the guest's attention transfers from one to the next without a gap. The bridge sentence ('This one is taken, but here is a similar studio 3 blocks away') must acknowledge the loss while immediately redirecting energy forward. The tone should feel like the agent in the call: casual, unfazed, already one step ahead ('If this one is not available, are you open to other locations?'). The proactive suggestion should feel like the platform is working for the guest, not making the guest work for the platform. Search results should present a single dominant recommendation that says 'We found your match' rather than a grid that says 'Here are your options -- start comparing.'",

But the promise is made verbally, weeks before move-in, and must be delivered physically by the space and digitally by the House Manual. If Vince arrives at the space for the first time and cannot find where to put his stuff, cannot connect to WiFi, and is confronted with a dense multi-page House Manual, the gap between the emotional promise ('feel like home') and the physical reality ('I am confused in a stranger's apartment') creates a betrayal-of-trust moment that no subsequent positive experience can fully recover.

He will scan for the door code and WiFi password, skip everything else, and miss the storage location that was the core of the 'feel like home' promise.",

The storage card -- the operationalization of the core promise -- appears as the third card, after the immediate needs (access and WiFi) are met but before the guest has settled in. The storage card must show the exact drawer, shelf, or area with a photo, so the guest can locate it by visual matching without reading a description. The emotional target is the moment when Vince opens his designated drawer and thinks 'This is my spot' -- the physical manifestation of belonging.

          "reason": "A generic confirmation ('We received your proposal') provides zero emotional scaffolding for the wait. The guest has no idea what happens next, when to expect a response, or whether anyone is actually looking at their proposal. The information vacuum fills with anxiety.",
          "example_bad": "A page appears: 'Thank you! We have received your proposal and will be in touch. In the meantime, browse more listings.' The guest has no idea if their proposal is being reviewed, ignored, or lost. After 2 days with no update, they assume the worst."

          "reason": "Email is a one-way broadcast, not a relationship. A single email followed by silence tells the guest 'we got your thing and now we will disappear until we are ready.' No human relationship works this way. The platform must maintain a visible, ongoing presence during the wait -- through the in-app status tracker, not just email.",
          "example_bad": "An automated email arrives: 'Your proposal #4521 has been submitted. You will hear from us soon.' Three days later, Vince checks his email every morning, sees nothing, and starts browsing Airbnb."
