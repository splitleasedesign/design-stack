      "problem": "Vince scanned the listing page and extracted only two data points -- location (Nolita, Mulberry St) and amenity (kitchen) -- because those match conventional listing visual patterns he has seen on Airbnb, Craigslist, and rental sites. The entire service concept (ghost roommate, exclusive-when-there, personal storage, nightly pricing) was invisible to his scan because these novel concepts have no established visual convention. Krug's billboard design principle says the most important information must be the most visually prominent, yet the most important information for a first-time visitor to this novel service category -- what the service IS -- occupies zero visual real estate. The result: Vince needed a phone call to learn what the listing page should have communicated in 5 seconds.",
      "solution": "Create a distinct visual block -- a 'service concept card' -- that appears above the fold on every listing page and the discovery/home page, BEFORE the photo gallery. This card uses a visual treatment that is deliberately different from standard listing elements to break scanning autopilot and force attention. The card contains: (1) A one-line value proposition in Instrument Serif at heading scale on the warm surface background, (2) A 3-panel inline illustration using accent-green line art on accent-light background showing the time-split (your nights / roommate's nights / your stuff stays), (3) A scannable label in Outfit underneath each panel. The card is bordered with border-strong and uses radius-lg to distinguish it from standard content cards. The visual distinctness signals 'this is not a normal listing detail -- read this first.' Total scan time target: under 5 seconds.",

      "problem": "Vince thinks in office days ('Monday, Tuesday') but the platform books by stay nights ('Sunday, Monday'). He made a translation error during the call, initially saying 'Monday, Tuesday' before correcting to 'Sunday, Monday' at 6:34-6:43. The agent acknowledged this is a common confusion. Any schedule display that shows only stay nights forces every guest to perform this mental translation on every encounter -- proposal creation, date changes, dashboard review. Krug's principle that 'every question mark adds to our cognitive workload' means this recurring translation is a recurring visual design failure. The schedule display must speak the guest's language (office days) first and derive the platform's language (stay nights) second.",
      "solution": "Design a dual-format schedule component that always shows both representations. The primary visual element is the guest's office days in a prominent, colored badge row using accent on accent-light background. Immediately below, in a secondary visual treatment, the derived stay nights appear in ink-soft with a connecting visual element (a small downward arrow or 'equals' sign) that communicates the derivation. On first encounter (proposal creation), include a one-line bridge sentence in IBM Plex Mono italic at small size: 'In the office Mon-Tue means you arrive Sunday night.' On subsequent encounters (dashboard, date changes), show only the dual badges without the bridge sentence. The office-day badges use the accent color palette; the stay-night badges use ink-muted on bg-deep, creating a clear visual hierarchy where the guest's mental model is primary and the booking model is secondary.",

      "problem": "Vince's dominant anxiety throughout the call is schedule uncertainty. He asks about reducing nights before he has even heard a price (5:06-5:25). Yet flexibility information was conveyed only verbally and has no visual presence on the platform. At every commitment point -- viewing a listing, creating a proposal, signing a lease, managing an active arrangement -- Vince needs to see that he is not locked in. Krug's visual hierarchy principle demands that the most important information be the most prominent, but flexibility (one of the most important factors for Vince's decision) occupies zero screen real estate. The absence of visible flexibility messaging signals that the platform does not understand or prioritize the guest's core concern, eroding trust per Krug: 'the fact that the people who built the site didn't care enough to make things obvious and easy can erode our confidence.'",
      "solution": "Create a standardized 'flexibility assurance callout' component that appears at every commitment gate with consistent but phase-appropriate content.

Adjust anytime after move-in.'; at acceptance, 'Your arrangement includes built-in flexibility. Change your schedule with 1-week notice.'; at active lease, the callout becomes an actionable element with a 'Change my schedule' link in accent color.

Krug's 'don't make me think' principle applies directly: this multiplication is a question mark that could be eliminated. Furthermore, a nightly rate without monthly context is meaningless for comparison -- Vince cannot compare '$113/night for 2 nights' to his current commuting cost or to a traditional rental without performing the calculation. The visual presentation of price determines whether the number feels reasonable or alarming, and a decontextualized nightly rate is more likely to feel alarming.",

The monthly total is personalized to the guest's specific schedule (Vince's 2 nights/week yields a different monthly total than 1 night/week). On the listing page before a schedule is known, show a range: '$X-Y/month depending on your schedule.' On the proposal creation page, show the exact monthly total for the selected schedule.

The storage card is the third card -- early enough to encounter during first scan, positioned after the immediate needs (access and WiFi) are resolved. The storage card's photo must show the ACTUAL storage location in the specific unit, not a generic illustration, because it operationalizes the verbal promise into physical reality.",

When told it might not be available, he instantly pivoted to 'Yeah' for other options near the Financial District (3:52-4:02). This is Krug's satisficing principle in action: guests choose the first reasonable option and do not optimize. A search results page designed as a grid of equally-sized listing cards fights this behavior by presenting too many options with equal visual weight, forcing the guest to compare when they want to act. Worse, if the first listing is unavailable and the results page shows a generic 'no results' or 'unavailable' state, the satisficing guest leaves rather than restarting a search.",
      "solution": "Design search results with a single recommended listing as the visually dominant element. The recommended listing card is approximately 2x the size of alternative listings below it, uses shadow-md for elevation, sits on a surface background, and includes a subtle accent-colored 'Best match' badge in the top-left corner. The badge uses IBM Plex Mono at small size on accent-light background to signal data-driven recommendation. Below the recommended listing, 2-3 alternative listings appear at standard card size with shadow-sm, visually subordinate. If the recommended listing is unavailable, it displays in a muted state (reduced opacity, ink-ghost text, 'No longer available' label) with the next-best match automatically promoted to the dominant position and a one-line explanation: 'This one is taken. Here is a similar space nearby.' This 'fallback promotion' happens inline, not as a separate search state, preventing the empty-results dropout that satisficing behavior predicts.",

The guest's nights are tappable/clickable with a subtle hover state (accent-bright border). (2) A clear 'Change my schedule' button in accent color positioned directly below or beside the calendar strip. The button uses Outfit weight 600 at body size -- not too large (it is not the primary action on the dashboard) but clearly visible and unambiguously clickable per Krug's 'make it obvious what's clickable' principle. (3) When tapped, the calendar strip enters edit mode: nights toggle on/off with a spring-eased animation (per taste model's animation philosophy), and a live-updating monthly cost in IBM Plex Mono appears below showing the impact of the change. (4) A one-line contextual hint appears on first use only: 'Tap a night to add or remove it from your schedule.' This hint uses ink-muted at small size and dismisses after first interaction.
