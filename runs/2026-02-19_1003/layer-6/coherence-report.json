The agent confirms this is a systemic pattern at 6:43-6:56. Kahneman's bat-and-ball problem (library) and Krug's 'every question mark adds to cognitive workload' (new) both predict errors when users are forced to perform format translations.

The dominant emotional thread is the progressive replacement of uncertainty with control. This aligns well with Vince's specific psychology: a polite, cautious person navigating a novel service with an uncertain work schedule. The two minor arc conflicts noted above are transition gaps, not contradictions, and can be resolved through bridging copy and interaction design without changing the target emotions."
