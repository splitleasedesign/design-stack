      "problem": "Vince reached out about a specific listing in Nolita but arrived at the phone call with zero understanding of how the service works. His cascade of questions at 1:19-1:33 ('How does this work? Is it like a hotel? Multiple people throughout the week where you clean everything out and you go home or what?') proves that whatever he saw on the platform failed Krug's First Law: 'It should be self-evident. Obvious. Self-explanatory.' The service concept — ghost roommate, exclusive-when-there, personal storage, nightly pricing — is novel enough that it cannot be inferred from standard listing information. Vince scanned for location and kitchen and missed everything that makes this service different from a hotel, Airbnb, or traditional sublet. The platform's discovery and listing pages currently require a phone call to explain what the service even IS, which means every guest who does not call drops out with a wrong mental model.",
      "solution": "Make the service concept the single most visually prominent element on both the discovery page and every listing page. This means: (1) A one-sentence value proposition at the top of every listing that explains the model before any photos, amenities, or pricing: 'Your own apartment 2 nights a week — a matched roommate uses it when you are not there, and your stuff stays.' (2) Use a visual explainer (3-panel illustration or short animation) that shows the time-split concept in under 5 seconds — you are there Sunday-Monday, your roommate is there Tuesday-Friday, your toiletries stay in your drawer. (3) Place this explainer above the fold on the listing page, before photos and amenities. Krug's visual hierarchy principle demands that the most important information for first-time comprehension be the most prominent, and for a novel service the concept IS the most important information. (4) Name the concept in plain language that passes the 'next-door neighbor' test from Krug Ch.1: 'shared apartment, separate schedules' not 'hybrid living solution' or 'periodic tenancy.'",

      "problem": "Guests think in office days ('I'm supposed to be in the office Monday, Tuesday') but the platform requires booking nights ('Sunday, Monday nights'). Vince made this exact translation error during the call, initially saying 'Monday, Tuesday' (3:25) before correcting himself to 'Sunday, Monday' (6:34-6:43): 'Actually, I'm sorry. I'm thinking about it. I think what I mean is Sunday, Monday, I'm supposed to be in the office Monday, Tuesday. So I think the nights I want to stay might be something like that.' The agent acknowledged this is a common confusion (6:43-6:56): 'thinking of the days you need with the backing up to the nights, that isn't completely understandable.' This is not a one-time error — it recurs every time the guest selects dates, changes dates, or reviews their schedule. Krug warns that every question mark adds to cognitive workload. The days-to-nights translation is a question mark that appears at every schedule interaction and will produce booking errors every time the guest's System 2 is even slightly depleted.",
      "solution": "The platform must perform the days-to-nights conversion automatically and display both formats simultaneously. This means: (1) When a guest enters their schedule, offer the input as 'Which days are you in the office?' not 'Which nights do you need to book?' The guest enters Monday-Tuesday (their mental model), and the platform shows 'You will stay Sunday and Monday nights' (the booking model). (2) On every schedule display — the proposal, the confirmation, the active lease dashboard, the date change tool — show BOTH formats: 'Office days: Mon-Tue | Stay nights: Sun-Mon.' (3) When the guest modifies their schedule, always start from the office-days input and re-derive the nights. Never ask the guest to select nights directly. (4) Include a one-line explanatory note on first use: 'Since you work Monday, you will need to arrive Sunday night.'

His employer has not confirmed his office days (0:39: 'I'm still waiting on them to make things official'). He asks about reducing from two nights to one (5:06-5:25: 'Is there a times when I could just do one night a week... is that too little on your end?'). He learns about date trading but only superficially processes it (5:25-5:39, followed by 'Right, right. Okay'). Every phase of Vince's journey is colored by the question 'What if things change?' Yet this flexibility information is nowhere visible on the platform — it was conveyed verbally in a phone call he may not remember in detail weeks later. Krug's scanning principle means that if flexibility assurances are not visually prominent at the moment of commitment (proposal, acceptance, lease signing), the guest will either hesitate or commit with anxiety that erodes long-term retention. The fear of being locked into inflexible terms is a powerful dropout force that operates at every commitment point.",
      "solution": "Surface flexibility messaging as a prominent, reassuring element at every point where the guest is asked to commit or make a decision. This means: (1) On listing pages, include a visible 'Flexibility' section that states: 'Change your nights anytime through the app. Scale up or down as your schedule changes.' This should be as prominent as pricing, not buried in terms. (2) On the proposal creation page, include a reassurance banner: 'This is your starting schedule — you can adjust your nights anytime after you move in.' (3) On the acceptance/lease signing page, highlight the change mechanism: 'Your lease includes built-in flexibility. You can trade nights with your roommate or change your schedule through the app.' (4) On the active lease dashboard, make the date-change tool the second-most prominent element after the upcoming-stays display. If the tool is hard to find, the flexibility promise feels empty.

If the platform's search experience is designed for comparison-shopping — multiple filters, sort options, feature comparison grids — it mismatches how guests like Vince actually search.

Your personal storage drawer is included.' Repetition at every commitment point ensures these concepts are understood before the guest commits.",

      "problem": "During the call, Vince learned about three platform features verbally: (1) date trading with the ghost roommate (5:25-5:39: 'through our app, once you're in a rental agreement, you can actually change your dates on the flat using the app'), (2) personal storage between stays (2:10-2:20: 'you're able to store your stuff in between stays, like toiletries and monitors'), and (3) the ability to scale from two nights to one (5:06-5:25). His response to the date-trading explanation was 'Right, right. Okay' — classic muddling-through as Krug describes: he accepted the reassurance without deeply understanding the mechanism. When Vince encounters these features on the platform weeks later, he will have a vague memory of a verbal explanation but no experiential understanding. Krug's muddling-through principle (Ch.2, Fact of Life #3: 'We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through') predicts he will attempt to use these features based on incomplete memory and wrong assumptions. The gap between what was explained verbally and what the platform actually presents is a comprehension risk at every phase where these features matter.",
      "solution": "Every feature explained verbally during the call must be self-evident when encountered on the platform, requiring zero recall from the verbal explanation. This means: (1) The date-change tool must be understandable to someone who has never heard of it, not just someone who vaguely remembers a 30-second phone explanation from 4 weeks ago. Follow Krug's self-evident standard: the tool's purpose, mechanism, and outcome must be obvious from looking at it. (2) Storage instructions must be physically and digitally clear at move-in. Show exactly where the storage drawer/area is, what fits, and what to leave versus take. Use photos or diagrams, not text descriptions. (3) The scale-up/scale-down mechanism must be findable and usable from the active lease dashboard without remembering that it exists. Use a visible 'Change my schedule' button on the main dashboard, not a settings submenu. (4) At each feature's first encounter on the platform, provide a single-sentence contextual explanation that echoes the call language: 'Remember: you can trade nights with your roommate here.' This bridges the verbal memory to the digital action. (5) Follow Krug's convention principle: make each tool work like something the guest has used before (a calendar for date changes, a checklist for storage, a slider for night count).",
