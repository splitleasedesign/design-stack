      "problem": "Vince reached out about a specific listing in Nolita but arrived at the phone call with zero understanding of how the service works. His cascade of questions at 1:19-1:33 ('How does this work? Is it like a hotel? Multiple people throughout the week where you clean everything out and you go home or what?') proves that whatever he saw on the platform failed Krug's First Law: pages should be self-evident. The service concept -- ghost roommate, exclusive-when-there, personal storage, nightly pricing -- is novel enough that it cannot be inferred from standard listing information. Vince scanned for location and kitchen and missed everything that makes this service different from a hotel, Airbnb, or traditional sublet. The platform's discovery and listing pages currently require a phone call to explain what the service IS, meaning every guest who does not call drops out with a wrong mental model.",
      "solution": "Make the service concept the single most visually prominent element on both the discovery page and every listing page. This means: (1) A one-sentence value proposition at the top of every listing that explains the model before any photos, amenities, or pricing: 'Your own apartment 2 nights a week -- a matched roommate uses it when you are not there, and your stuff stays.' (2) A visual explainer (3-panel illustration or short animation) that shows the time-split concept in under 5 seconds: you are there Sunday-Monday, your roommate is there Tuesday-Friday, your toiletries stay in your drawer. (3) Place the explainer above the fold, before photos and amenities, because for a novel service the concept IS the most important information. (4) Name the concept in plain language that passes Krug's 'next-door neighbor' test: 'shared apartment, separate schedules' not 'hybrid living solution' or 'periodic tenancy.'",

The agent acknowledged this is a common confusion at 6:43-6:56: 'thinking of the days you need with the backing up to the nights, that isn't completely understandable.' This is not a one-time error -- it recurs at every schedule interaction. Krug warns that every question mark adds to cognitive workload. The days-to-nights translation is a recurring question mark that produces booking errors whenever the guest's attention is even slightly divided.",
      "solution": "The platform must accept input in the guest's mental model (office days) and perform the conversion to stay nights automatically. This means: (1) The schedule input asks 'Which days are you in the office?' not 'Which nights do you need to book?' The guest taps Monday-Tuesday, and the platform shows 'You will stay Sunday and Monday nights.' (2) Every schedule display shows BOTH formats: 'Office days: Mon-Tue | Stay nights: Sun-Mon.' (3) When the guest modifies their schedule, always start from office-days input and re-derive the nights. Never ask the guest to select nights directly. (4) Include a one-line explanatory note on first use: 'Since you work Monday, you will arrive Sunday night.' This bridges the mental model gap once, then the dual display maintains clarity ongoing.",

His employer has not confirmed his office days (0:39: 'I'm still waiting on them to make things official').

Yet this flexibility information was conveyed only verbally in a phone call he may not remember in detail weeks later.

This must be as prominent as pricing. (2) On the proposal creation page, include a reassurance banner: 'This is your starting schedule -- you can adjust your nights anytime after move-in.' (3) On the acceptance page, highlight the change mechanism: 'Your lease includes built-in flexibility. Trade nights with your roommate or change your schedule through the app.' (4) On the active lease dashboard, make the date-change tool the second-most prominent element after upcoming stays. If the tool is hard to find, the flexibility promise feels empty.

Krug's scanning behavior explains why: guests scan for familiar patterns first (location, photos, price) and ignore unfamiliar content. The ghost roommate concept, nightly pricing model, and date-trading feature are NOVEL concepts with no conventional visual pattern.

(3) The storage and personal-items arrangement is highlighted with the same prominence as major amenities, not buried in a description paragraph.

      "problem": "During the call, the agent promised Vince a 'feel like home' experience (2:10-2:20), including personal storage for 'toiletries and monitors and whatever you need there.' But Vince's first physical encounter with the space will test this promise. Krug's scanning principle predicts that Vince will NOT read a multi-page House Manual. He will scan for the essentials (key, WiFi, kitchen) and skip the rest. If storage locations, cleaning protocols, and house rules are buried in dense text, Vince will muddle through without reading them -- potentially violating rules he never saw, failing to find the storage he was promised, and forming a negative first impression that contradicts the verbal promise. The gap between 'feel like home' (the promise) and 'I cannot figure out where to put my stuff' (the reality) is where early churn originates.",
      "solution": "Design the House Manual and move-in experience for scanning, not reading. This means: (1) Break the manual into clearly defined areas following Krug's billboard principles: 'Essentials' (key, WiFi, address), 'Your Storage' (exactly where, what fits, photo), 'Kitchen' (what is shared, what is yours), 'House Rules' (3 bullet points maximum). (2) Use a scannable card-based format, not a continuous document. Each card covers one topic with a heading, one photo or icon, and under 20 words. (3) Front-load the 'feel like home' details: storage location photo, your designated drawer/shelf, where to put your monitor. These operationalize the promise made during the call. (4) Deliver the manual digitally 24 hours before first stay, not at check-in when the guest is carrying bags and tired. (5) Make the manual accessible from the active lease dashboard for repeat reference -- it must be findable in under 5 seconds any time.",
