      "recommendation": "Fix the pricing arithmetic in ds-ui-1831-004 and establish a platform-wide pricing model",
      "rationale": "The Pre-Populated Proposal Builder contains a critical arithmetic error ($850/night x 13 weeks showing $11,050 total, which is internally inconsistent). This element is at the single highest-stakes cross-activation moment in the platform. If the pricing model is wrong in the spec, it will be wrong in production. Additionally, the broader pricing phase has only 'thin' coverage across both runs.",
      "suggested_approach": "Clarify whether Split Lease uses nightly or weekly pricing. Update ds-ui-1831-004's copy spec to be arithmetically correct. Then consider a dedicated pricing run with a behavioral economics lens (Thaler/Ariely) to address the endowment effect, anchoring, and fee transparency -- producing both the host-side pricing interface and the guest-side price display."
    },

      "recommendation": "Design the inline authentication modal as a standalone UI element",
      "rationale": "This is explicitly called out in the user stories, identified as critical by both runs' theoretical frameworks, referenced in both L6 coherence reports, and yet has zero buildable UI elements across either run. It is the single most explicitly requested user story that has no covering element. Every high-intent action (messaging, proposing) depends on it.",
      "suggested_approach": "Design a context-preserving inline auth modal that: (1) overlays the current view without destroying scroll/filter state; (2) supports multiple auth methods (email, social, phone); (3) uses the production purple palette; (4) auto-dismisses on success with a brief confirmation; (5) preserves the user's intended action and resumes it after auth. This can be designed without a specific psychological lens -- it is a pure interaction design problem."

      "recommendation": "Design move-in phase UI elements for both host and guest",
      "rationale": "Move-in is marked 'absent' in the L0 phase coverage matrix, has only 25 of 420 library elements, and both L6 reports flag it as the most significant remaining gap. Both runs' theoretical lenses identify it as critical (Freud: the moment the stranger physically enters the space; Flow: where the physical world interrupts the digital flow channel) but neither produces a buildable component.",
      "suggested_approach": "A dedicated cross-run (host + guest) with Norman's 'knowledge in the world' chapter or a physical-to-digital transition lens. Must produce: (1) Guest Move-In Checklist Card (arrival protocol, key exchange, first-night orientation); (2) Host Move-In Preparation Card (guest arrival details, space preparation checklist, first-stay expectations); (3) House Manual component that serves as Flow's 'culture' -- defensive construction against move-in chaos."

      "rationale": "This is the highest-severity contradiction identified by both coherence reports independently. ds-ui-1830-006 includes per-stay review beats; the existing library explicitly prohibits per-stay review prompts. The unresolved tension will create implementation confusion if both elements are merged into the library without a canonical resolution.",
      "suggested_approach": "Formalize the hybrid: (1) 3-point narrative reviews at weeks 4, midpoint, and final (existing library pattern, canonical); (2) Optional one-tap micro-ratings (5-point scale, no text, no expansion unless initiated) for the HOST's stay ritual card during rhythm phase; (3) Optional one-tap micro-ratings for the GUEST during rhythm phase, never appearing as unaddressed tasks. Document this as a platform-wide Review Strategy element that supersedes both the existing batched review element and the new micro-review prescriptions."

      "rationale": "Two significant host-side gaps: (1) No host acceptance confirmation experience exists -- when a guest commits, the host has no designed celebration/orientation moment. (2) No host counter-proposal creation interface exists -- Run A covers counter-proposals at the principle level but produces no dedicated UI. The guest side has both (ds-ui-1831-005 for negotiation, ds-ui-1831-006 for acceptance) but the host side is missing the mirror components.",
      "suggested_approach": "Design: (1) Host Acceptance Confirmation Card showing confirmed guest trust signals, terms, and next-steps timeline (mirrors ds-ui-1831-006's structure); (2) Host Counter-Proposal Builder with term adjustment sliders, guest-impact preview, and market calibration data (mirrors ds-ui-1831-005's information architecture but framed as authority/gatekeeping rather than collaboration)."

This is the platform's most-visited page (13+ times per lease) and the element with the most theoretical reinforcement (five independent lenses). A production team receiving only the rhythm-phase HTML would have to guess at the orientation and reflection states.",
      "suggested_approach": "Produce full HTML/CSS for all three states: (1) Orientation (weeks 1-3): checklist-focused with House Manual access, arrival confirmation, first-message prompts; (2) Rhythm (weeks 4-9): existing implementation with timeline, micro-rating, stay info; (3) Reflection (weeks 10-13): cumulative stats, review prompts, re-booking or new search path. Each state should share the stable three-zone skeleton with different content."

      "rationale": "User stories identify 'verified reviews and host credibility signals' as cross-activation infrastructure. Trust signals are addressed architecturally across both runs (information hierarchy, placement) but no standalone component exists. The L6 guest coherence report also flags a contradiction between green trust badges (tokens.json) and purple trust badges (production), which can only be resolved by designing the canonical component.",
      "suggested_approach": "Design: (1) Trust Badge Component with verification checkmark, member-since date, and credibility tier; (2) Review Display Card with review summary (aggregate rating, review count), individual review entries, and temporal narrative (how ratings evolved). Use the production purple palette and the shield-check + pill pattern recommended by the L6 guest coherence report. This resolves both the green-vs-purple token conflict and the missing buildable component."

      "rationale": "ds-ui-1830-006 (Stay Cycle Ritual Card) depends on the guest submitting cleaning photos, but the guest-side submission interface is never designed. This is a structural dependency: the host-facing ritual card cannot function without its companion guest-facing submission flow. The cleaning photo beat is the second of three ritual confirmations that Freud's order principle requires.",
      "suggested_approach": "Design a Cleaning Photo Submission Card for the guest Stays Manager that: (1) appears at departure within the rhythm-phase content; (2) uses camera/upload affordance with 2x2 photo grid; (3) provides instant confirmation that photos were received; (4) frames submission as part of the stay cycle ritual, not as surveillance. The Flow lens would position this as a micro-challenge within the rhythm phase complexity ratchet."

      "recommendation": "Reconcile tokens.json with the production style guide",
      "rationale": "Both L6 coherence reports, the L0 comparison, and the MEMORY.md all flag the same persistent token drift: tokens.json uses warm green accent (#2d5a3d) while production uses purple (#31135D). All 14 UI elements across both runs correctly reference the production palette, but tokens.json remains stale. This drift will cause confusion for any developer using tokens.json as a reference.",
      "suggested_approach": "Update tokens.json to match the production style guide's purple palette. Deprecate the green accent. Formalize the seven new semantic tokens proposed in Run A's L6 report (--container-bg-warm, --trust-badge-bg, --font-evidence, --urgency-badge-bg/text, --zone-gap, --metric-hero-size, --protection-surface-bg).

But the guest discovery landing has no buildable component. L0 confirms: 'Run B covers discovery at the principle level but produces no dedicated discovery UI element for guests.'",
      "suggested_approach": "Design a Guest Discovery Landing Component that shows real listings (from the Progressive Density Card), neighborhood highlights (from the Living Map), and platform trust signals before any sign-up. Must implement Flow's 'distinct world' quality -- the landing should feel visually different from everyday browsing through the production purple palette and immersive listing content."
