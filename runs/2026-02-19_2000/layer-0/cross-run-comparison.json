Run B reveals WHY the guest needs pre-populated proposals (self-consciousness reduction). Together they form a complete design specification: pre-populate on the guest side to reduce anxiety AND structure the output for trust-first scanning on the host side.

But they prescribe complementary temporal strategies: Run A wants PREDICTABLE REPETITION (same layout, same ritual, same structure every week) to contain host anxiety. Run B wants PROGRESSIVE EVOLUTION (escalating complexity matched to growing guest skill) to prevent guest boredom. The resolution: the HOST-facing Stays Manager should be ritualistically consistent (Freud), while the GUEST-facing Stays Manager should evolve within a stable skeleton (Flow).

Run B frames it from the guest side: messaging is the flow-enabling intermediate challenge that builds confidence before the higher-stakes proposal.

      "implication": "Both frameworks explain WHY inline authentication matters -- not just as a UX convenience but as a structural requirement for sustaining engagement.

These micro-ratings should never feel mandatory or accumulate as unaddressed tasks.

The HOST sees the counter-proposal interface as an empowerment tool (they are the gatekeeper making an informed decision). The GUEST sees the negotiation comparison card as a collaborative tool (they are a participant in a fair exchange). The platform should present the SAME underlying data differently to each side: the host sees 'Adjust terms' as an exercise of authority; the guest sees 'Suggest a change' as a collaborative move.

    "strongest_reinforcement": "Both runs strongly reinforce the Stays Manager design. Run A's works-004 merges with ds-ui-003 (Stays Manager Weekly Dashboard), and Run B's works-004 merges with the same element. The Stays Manager is now validated by five independent theoretical lenses: Kahneman (System 1 dashboard), Eyal (Hook Model for habit formation), Norman (affordances/signifiers), Freud (repetitive rituals for anxiety containment), and Csikszentmihalyi (complexity ratchet for sustained engagement). This makes the Stays Manager the single most theoretically reinforced component in the entire library.",
    "most_concerning_contradiction": "The review frequency tension between Run B's complexity ratchet (one-tap micro-reviews during each stay cycle in rhythm phase) and the existing library's Batched Review Prompts (explicitly prohibiting per-stay review prompts due to fatigue). Run A's ritual card also includes a per-stay review beat. The resolution requires distinguishing between micro-ratings (one-tap, no text, optional -- acceptable per-stay) and narrative reviews (text-based, effortful -- batch to 3 moments). Both runs' L6 reports independently flag this as the highest-priority contradiction to resolve.",
    "token_drift_note": "Both runs flag the same ongoing token drift: tokens.json uses warm green accent (#2d5a3d) while production uses purple (#31135D). Both runs correctly reference the production palette. Both L6 reports recommend treating the production style guide as authoritative and updating or deprecating tokens.json. The proposed coral accent (Run B's --accent-coral for save-heart) is flagged as non-canonical by Run B's own L6."
