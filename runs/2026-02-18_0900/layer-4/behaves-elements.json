      "problem": "The platform currently asks first and gives later: sign up, then see value. But Cialdini's reciprocity research shows that the gift must precede the request to trigger obligation. Bryant models this perfectly on the call -- he walks Sherene through the ghost roommate scenario, names the guests, offers solutions to concerns she hasn't even raised yet, all before asking her for any commitment. The platform inverts this: it gates all value behind forms and account creation. When Sherene arrives at the platform after Bryant's call, the first interaction is a request (create account), not a gift (here's what we already prepared for you). This violates the temporal sequencing that makes reciprocity work.",
      "solution": "Every interactive touchpoint must deliver a visible gift before requesting an action. The interaction sequence is: (1) Platform displays personalized gift (pre-filled data from call, earnings estimate, guest profile snippet) with a 300ms ease-out entrance animation. (2) Host processes the gift (minimum 2-second dwell before any call-to-action becomes prominent). (3) Platform reveals the request (form field, confirmation button, next step) with a secondary visual weight. The UI must enforce this temporal sequence: the gift container renders and animates first, the request elements render 2 seconds later or below the fold. If the host scrolls past the gift without processing it, the reciprocity trigger is lost.",

(2) Events are grouped by weekly cycles (Mon-Sun) matching the ghost roommate rotation. The current cycle is always expanded; past cycles are collapsed but expandable. (3) Each event row shows: who gave what, when, and the resulting balance state (green checkmark for completed, amber clock for pending, red alert for missed). (4) The overall health indicator at the top updates with each event: a horizontal bar with segments for Payment, Cleaning, and Schedule, each colored by their current status.

The platform collapses this 27-minute cascade into a single marketing bullet list, destroying the compounding effect.",
      "solution": "Implement a notification and interaction cadence that delivers one gift per touchpoint, time-separated to prevent habituation and preserve the cascading effect. (1) During evaluation: if the host has received an agent call, the platform sends 3 follow-up gifts over 3 days -- Day 1: guest profile summary, Day 2: earnings estimate, Day 3: link to explore the platform with pre-filled data. Each is a separate message, each requires the host to open and process it before the next arrives. (2) During onboarding: pre-fill one field at a time as the host navigates, with visible acknowledgment for each: 'We already know your property is in Brooklyn' (pause) 'And that your room is available December 3' (pause) 'And that you're looking for $1,200/month.' Each pre-fill is a separate gift moment. (3) During listing creation: after each wizard step, show a benefit that step unlocked: 'Step 2 complete: your listing is now visible to 12 matching guests.' (4) During active lease: daily payment confirmations, weekly summaries, and monthly reports -- each a separate gift, never bundled.",

        "default": "The gift queue contains 0+ pending gifts based on the host's journey phase. The next gift is scheduled based on the cadence rules (minimum 4 hours between gifts during active engagement, minimum 24 hours between gifts during evaluation/onboarding).",
        "loading": "Gift content is being personalized. Show nothing until personalization is complete -- a generic gift violates the reciprocity principle because it does not feel personal.",

        "error": "If a scheduled gift fails to deliver (notification error, email bounce), retry once after 1 hour.

      },
      "transition_principle": "Each gift notification should arrive as a standalone moment, not as part of a batch. The visual treatment should make each gift feel individually considered: personalized subject line, contextual timing ('Good morning, Sherene'), and a single clear value statement. The transition from one gift to the next should feel like a natural continuation of a conversation, not a marketing drip campaign.",

        "rationale": "The cadence must feel natural, not mechanical. Spacing gifts by at least 4 hours during active engagement and 24 hours during evaluation prevents the host from perceiving the pattern as automated marketing. Each gift should feel like Bryant remembered something and reached out."

      "journey_state_awareness": "During evaluation (pre-commitment), the cadence is slow (1 gift per day over 3 days) to build obligation gradually without pressure. During onboarding (first platform visit), the cadence is faster (1 gift per wizard step, approximately every 60 seconds) because the host is actively engaged. During active lease, the cadence is daily (payment confirmations) with weekly summaries as bonus gifts.",
      "edge_cases": [
        "Host does not open the first gift email. Do not escalate to a second gift -- send a gentle follow-up on the same gift: 'Just checking in -- did you see the guest profiles we sent?'",
        "Host opens all gifts immediately (binge behavior). Allow it but do not accelerate the queue. The next gift still arrives at its scheduled time to maintain the cadence effect.",
        "Multiple agents have engaged the host (Bryant and another team member). Gift attribution should be consistent -- all gifts come from the host's primary agent contact to maintain the personal relationship.",
        "Host explicitly requests all information at once ('Just send me everything'). Provide a comprehensive overview but structure it as a table of contents with expandable sections, preserving the one-at-a-time gift experience within a single document."
