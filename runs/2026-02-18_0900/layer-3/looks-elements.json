      "problem": "When the platform shows both gift information (what the host receives) and request information (what the host must provide) on the same screen, the visual weight is currently equal or tilted toward requests. Form fields, input borders, placeholder text, and submit buttons all carry strong visual weight through their functional styling. Gift information (earnings estimates, included services, pre-filled data) is typically rendered as secondary text -- smaller, lighter, less prominent. This visual imbalance contradicts Cialdini's reciprocity principle: if the gift is not visually dominant, it does not feel like a gift. It feels like fine print. Bryant makes his gifts dominant on the call through vocal emphasis, timing (gifts come first), and volume (he spends more time on what he offers than on what he needs). The platform must achieve the same dominance visually.",
      "solution": "Establish a visual weight system where gift information is always visually heavier than request information on any shared screen. (1) Gift headlines: use Inter at --text-xl (20px), --font-weight-bold (700), color --primary-purple (#31135D). This is the largest, heaviest text on any page that mixes gifts and requests. (2) Gift supporting text: use DM Sans at --text-md (16px), --font-weight-medium (500), color --text-dark (#1a1a1a). Generous line-height (--line-height-relaxed, 1.6) for readability. (3) Gift containers: bg-off-white (rgb(252, 250, 255)) with --shadow-purple-sm (0 2px 4px rgba(49, 19, 93, 0.2)) and --rounded-xl (12px). The purple-tinted shadow signals 'this is from the platform, for you.' (4) Request elements (form fields, buttons): visually lighter -- Inter at --text-base (14px), --font-weight-normal (400), standard --border-color (#e5e7eb) borders, no shadow. (5) The visual hierarchy ratio: gift elements should occupy 60%+ of above-the-fold space. Request elements should be positioned below or alongside gifts, never above them.",

Currently, there is no unified visual indicator for this. The host must check multiple sections (payments, messages, cleaning records) to assess the health of the arrangement. For the ghost roommate model, this problem is amplified: two guests mean twice as many reciprocity touchpoints to track.

Each sub-indicator uses a traffic-light system (green dot, amber dot, red dot) with a one-line text label.

      "journey_phases": ["active_lease"],
      "problem": "Daily payment notifications risk becoming invisible through repetition. Cialdini's reciprocity research shows that the power of a gift diminishes if it becomes routine and unnoticed. The visual challenge: make each daily payment notification feel like a distinct gift, not a routine system message, while maintaining visual consistency with the brand. The current notification style (if implemented) likely uses a standard alert pattern -- same color, same layout, same wording -- which habituates the host and reduces the reciprocal reinforcement effect. Each payment must feel fresh and personally relevant, like Bryant saying 'I'll compensate you for Greg's stay' (not 'Payment #17 of 90').",
      "solution": "Design daily payment notifications with a visual rhythm pattern that creates variation within consistency. (1) Base container: a compact card (max-width 320px on mobile, 400px on desktop) with --bg-white background, --rounded-lg (8px) corners, --shadow-sm for subtle elevation. Left accent border in --secondary-purple (rgb(109, 49, 194)), 3px wide. (2) Primary content: payment amount in DM Sans, --text-lg (18px), --font-weight-bold (700), --primary-purple. Guest name in Inter, --text-base (14px), --font-weight-medium (500), --text-dark. Night description in Inter, --text-sm (12px), --text-gray. (3) Running total: a subtle progress bar below the payment details showing monthly accumulation. Use --gradient-purple-button for the filled portion, --bg-light-gray for the unfilled portion. Label: 'This month: $X of $1,200 target' in --text-sm, --text-gray. (4) Visual variation: alternate the accent icon between a small calendar icon (Feather icon 'calendar') for weekday stays and a small home icon (Feather icon 'home') for weekend stays. This subtle variation prevents visual habituation while maintaining the purple brand. (5) Micro-animation: on arrival, the payment amount should count up from $0 to the full amount over 0.3s (--transition-slow) with --easing-ease-out. This creates a moment of visual delight that reinforces the 'gift received' feeling.",
