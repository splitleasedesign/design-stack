      "problem": "Sherene arrives at the platform with zero brand awareness -- she thought Split Lease was based in California (14:48). Her emotional baseline is guarded curiosity: willing to listen but actively looking for reasons to disengage. The platform's discovery experience must trigger the same emotional shift that Bryant's call achieved: from 'who are these people' to 'this is interesting, tell me more.' The challenge is that Bryant's gift (a personalized 27-minute walkthrough of her specific scenario) cannot be replicated at scale through a website. The platform must find a digital equivalent of the uninvited gift that creates enough curiosity-driven obligation to keep the host engaged past the first 10 seconds.",
      "solution": "Frame the discovery experience as an uninvited gift of knowledge -- the platform gives the host personalized information about their earning potential and their specific market before asking who they are. The emotional target is curiosity: the feeling of having received something unexpectedly useful that creates a desire to learn more. The tone should be confident but not salesy, specific but not invasive: 'Brooklyn rooms like yours are earning $1,200/month with ghost roommate arrangements.' This specificity is itself a gift -- it says 'we know your market, and we are sharing what we know before you give us anything.'",

When she arrives at the platform for the first time, she is emotionally vulnerable: the warmth of the call is fading, the strangeness of a new interface is rising, and her partner may have expressed skepticism. If the platform feels cold, institutional, or unfamiliar, the emotional state collapses from cautious optimism to 'this is not what I was told.' The target emotion is relief: the immediate, visceral feeling that the platform knows who she is, what she discussed, and what she was promised.",

      "problem": "At the end of a 3-4 month lease, Sherene will re-evaluate the arrangement. Her decision framework will be: 'Was this worth the complexity of two rotating strangers?' If the answer depends on memory, it will be skewed by recency bias (the last week's experience) and negativity bias (any incidents will loom larger than routine successes). The platform must counter these biases by making the cumulative positive reciprocity visible: not just the total earnings, but the total gifts given and received across the entire lease. Cialdini's research shows that people who feel satisfied with an arrangement are more likely to agree to future arrangements. The retention experience must create this satisfaction by surfacing the full scope of what the platform gave across 90+ days.",
      "solution": "Design the retention experience around a Cumulative Gift Ledger -- a visual summary of every gift the platform delivered during the active lease, presented as a cohesive narrative of mutual benefit. The emotional target is gratitude: the feeling that the arrangement exceeded expectations and that leaving would mean losing something valuable. The ledger should include: total earnings ($3,600+ over 3 months), total payments received (90+), total handoffs completed successfully (24+), total cleaning confirmations (24+), incidents resolved (with emphasis on resolution, not the incident itself), and a comparison to what the host would have earned with a single guest. Frame the renewal as a continuation of the gift: 'We would love to keep this going. Here is what the next 3 months could look like.'",

If the retention summary shows that the ghost roommate arrangement delivered $3,600 over 3 months versus her previous baseline of ~$1,000-1,200 from nightly bookings, the contrast is the most powerful retention argument. The cumulative gift ledger makes this contrast viscerally visible."
