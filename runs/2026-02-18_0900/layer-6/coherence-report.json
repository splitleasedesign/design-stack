The mechanism differs -- works-001 operates through cognitive coherence (System 1 associative network), works-0900-001 operates through reciprocal obligation (Cialdini's uninvited gift) -- but the UX prescription is identical: value before request at every transition.",
      "combined_evidence": "Kahneman explains WHY value-before-request works (System 1 coherence enables System 2 engagement). Cialdini explains HOW to make it work (gifts create obligation to reciprocate with action). Combined insight: the gift IS the System 1 coherence signal. A personalized, relevant gift at a phase transition simultaneously passes the trust gate (System 1 approves) AND creates reciprocal obligation (Cialdini's rule activates). Two independent theoretical frameworks converge on the same design pattern.",

The new element adds the specific mechanism of visible reciprocity tracking for three-party ghost roommate arrangements -- a scenario the original element did not contemplate.",
