      "problem": "The current platform information hierarchy leads with what it needs from the host (forms, fields, inputs) rather than what it gives. Cialdini's reciprocity research establishes that compliance follows gifts, not requests. Bryant's call with Sherene demonstrates ideal information hierarchy: he opens every topic with what Split Lease provides (cleaning management, separate sheets, photo documentation, lockbox, daily payment) and only then surfaces what Sherene needs to provide (availability, price floor, house rules). The platform inverts this: landing on any creation or response page, the host sees input fields first and value statements second (or not at all). This ordering violates the reciprocity principle -- the host must perceive receiving before being asked to give.",
      "solution": "Restructure information hierarchy across all host-facing pages to follow the gift-first pattern: (1) Primary position (top of viewport, first scan point): what the platform is giving the host right now. For onboarding: 'Based on your conversation with Bryant, here is what we already know about your listing.' For proposal response: 'Here is what Greg and Johan are offering you.' For listing creation: 'Your estimated monthly earnings: $1,200+.' (2) Secondary position: context that reinforces the gift. For onboarding: pre-filled fields showing information already captured. For proposals: guest profiles with vetting results. (3) Tertiary position: what the host needs to provide. This comes LAST, after the host has received value. (4) The visual weight must match the hierarchy: gifts should be large, bold, and prominent. Forms should be lighter, less visually demanding, positioned below the fold if possible.",

This back-and-forth structure is the information architecture of trust-building through reciprocity. But the platform does not replicate this structure. FAQ pages list answers without concerns. Feature pages list capabilities without problems. Listing creation pages present fields without explaining what anxiety each field resolves. The information is organized by platform categories (features, pricing, rules) rather than by host concerns (cleaning, security, strangers, money). This means the host must do the cognitive work of mapping platform categories to their own concerns -- a translation effort that Bryant handles effortlessly in conversation.",

(1) During evaluation: present information as a series of cards, each starting with a common host concern ('Worried about cleaning between guests?') followed immediately by the platform's solution ('Ghost roommates manage cleaning with a shared checklist. Here is how it works.'). This mirrors Bryant at 01:14-01:45. (2) During onboarding: instead of a generic welcome, show a personalized concern-solution feed based on topics from the host's call. For Sherene: 'You asked about laundry -- here is how it works. You asked about security -- here is what's in place.' (3) During listing creation: label each wizard step with the concern it resolves. Step 5 (Rules) becomes 'Protect Your Space: Set expectations guests must follow.' Step 6 (Photos) becomes 'Build Guest Confidence: Show them what to expect.'

      "problem": "Sherene's core anxiety is strangers: 'I don't like dealing with strangers. And then two strangers that change like another level of energy' (09:34). Bryant resolves this anxiety by progressively disclosing personal details about Greg and Johan: Greg is 28, male, works in interior design, from Connecticut. Johan is 34, female, works in banking/Manhattan, from Connecticut, wants to be near her brother. Each detail converts the guests from abstract 'strangers' to concrete people. But this disclosure is conversational and sequential -- it unfolds over time, each new detail building on the last. The platform currently presents guest profiles as static data cards: all information at once, in a structured format. This loses the progressive disclosure power that makes the call effective. Showing everything at once is like meeting someone and immediately learning their full biography -- it's informationally complete but emotionally flat. The reciprocity lens adds another dimension: each piece of guest information Bryant shares is a gift. Sherene reciprocates each gift with a slightly deeper engagement. The platform must preserve this give-and-engage rhythm.",
      "solution": "Design guest profiles as a progressive disclosure sequence that mirrors the conversational revelation of personal details. (1) First disclosure (visible before any host action): name, age, gender, and reason for needing the space. This is what Bryant shares first -- enough to create a person, not just a profile. (2) Second disclosure (available after host expresses interest): employment, schedule, duration, and origin location. This mirrors Bryant sharing 'Greg works in interior design' and 'Johan is from Connecticut' after Sherene engages. (3) Third disclosure (available after host requests interview): vetting form results, custom question answers, vaccination status. This is the deepest level, corresponding to Bryant's promise to 'share our vetting form with them.' (4) Each disclosure level should be framed as a gift: 'Here is what we know about Greg' (not 'Greg's profile'). The framing matters -- 'what we know' implies the platform investigated on the host's behalf, which is a gift of effort. (5) Between each disclosure level, include a micro-action from the host (expand the profile, click 'Tell me more', request the vetting form). This creates the reciprocal rhythm: platform gives information, host gives engagement.",

But Cialdini's contrast principle and reciprocity research show that a number without context is evaluated by whatever anchor the viewer brings. Sherene's anchor is 'barely breaking even' (23:53) -- she sees any price through the lens of whether it covers her costs. Bryant reframes this by first showing what Sherene GETS (two reliable guests, daily payment, relationship management, premium above her asking price) and then naming the price. This gift-before-price framing makes the price feel like a fair exchange rather than a bare number. The platform's pricing UI shows the number first and the value second (or never), which forces the host to evaluate price in a vacuum.",

(1) Before any price appears, show the value stack: 'Included with your arrangement: daily payment guarantees, electronic lockbox, photo documentation, cleaning checklists, guest vetting, hosted interviews, security deposit management.' Each item in the stack is a gift that anchors the price. (2) Then show the price with Cialdini's contrast principle applied: show what the host would earn with a single traditional guest first (lower number), then show the ghost roommate premium (higher number). 'Traditional single guest: ~$800/month. Your ghost roommate arrangement: $1,200/month.' The contrast makes the premium feel larger. (3) Show the daily breakdown: '$40/night, paid to you the morning after each stay.' This makes the payment feel immediate and concrete, reinforcing the daily reciprocity cycle. (4) Show the net-of-costs view: 'After your estimated laundry and cleaning costs ($X), your net monthly income is $Y.' Sherene is explicitly worried about breaking even -- address this directly.",

There is no unified feed that shows the reciprocity balance at a glance. Cialdini's research shows that visible reciprocity creates social pressure to maintain balance.
