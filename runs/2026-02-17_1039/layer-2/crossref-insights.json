Across both host and guest calls, people repeatedly ask for legitimacy proof, manual vetting, and direct contact before committing; they also describe pricing/search opacity and workflow leakage into text/email. This matches the Cold Start lens: when trust, clarity, and coordination are weak at local decision moments, users do extra manual work and network value fails to compound.",
