      "problem": "Steve Zhang arrives with Sonder at $90/night as his explicit reference point. Kahneman's Prospect Theory shows all evaluations are coded as gains or losses relative to the reference, not as absolute values. The platform currently has no mechanism to capture the guest's reference point or surface comparisons against it. The guest's System 1 runs an imprecise, error-prone comparison that systematically favors the known alternative because Sonder's value is immediately legible (one number, everything included) while Split Lease's value requires System 2 computation. Without an interactive comparison, the guest leaves because the structural advantage (medium-term, no tourist tax, leave belongings) is never surfaced against their anchor.",
      "solution": "Implement a two-phase interaction: (1) During first search or onboarding, present a lightweight capture prompt: 'What do you currently pay for accommodation?' with quick-select options (Sonder, Airbnb, Hotels, Friend's place, Nothing) and a dollar input. This takes under 10 seconds. (2) Once captured, every listing card and listing detail page shows a live comparison module that updates in real time as the guest adjusts their stay pattern (nights per week, duration). The comparison shows the monthly delta as a gain: 'Save $120/month vs. Sonder.' The interaction is persistent -- changing nights per week on a listing immediately recalculates and animates the savings number, creating a visceral connection between configuration choices and financial outcomes. The comparison module is not a static label; it is a live calculator that responds to the guest's inputs.",

The current listing page shows photos and a price but does not help the guest project themselves into the space. The proposal form collects terms but does not reinforce the imagined future. This misses the critical psychological mechanism: if the platform can accelerate mental ownership before the commitment point (proposal submission), the endowment effect makes non-submission feel like a loss (losing the space they already mentally inhabit).

As they configure, a 'Your Space' preview card builds in real time: a cropped listing photo with the guest's configured dates overlaid as a mini-calendar, the personalized monthly cost, and the gain vs. their reference.

Kahneman's negativity dominance shows that one bad event (payment surprise, unresponsive host, date-change friction) erases the positive effect of multiple good experiences (5:1 Gottman ratio). The platform currently has no mechanism to continuously reinforce the positive frame during the lease. Without ongoing positive reinforcement, the guest's savings are forgotten, and any single negative event can flip their overall assessment from positive to negative. Steve tracks ROI continuously (0:16:05) and is sensitized to operational friction from Sonder (0:35:39).",
      "solution": "Build a Savings Reinforcement Loop into the active lease dashboard. On each weekly visit to the Leases page, the Savings Hero card (from looks-004) updates with a micro-interaction: the savings number counts up from last week's total to this week's total (a counting animation showing the new savings accruing). Below the number, a context line updates weekly: 'This week you saved $120 vs. hotels. Your total savings: $720.' The loop is closed with a milestone system: at $500 saved, $1,000 saved, $2,000 saved, etc., a brief celebratory moment appears: a badge on the savings card that says '$1,000 Saved' with the Split Lease logo. These milestones are designed to be screenshot-worthy for social sharing. The loop also includes a proactive loss-prevention pulse: if the host's response time degrades or a payment is upcoming, a subtle alert appears in the dashboard BEFORE the guest discovers the issue, framing the platform as proactively protective rather than reactive.",
