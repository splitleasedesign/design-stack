      "test_description": "Randomly assign listing page views to Control (A) or Shield (B). Track: (1) Listing-to-proposal rate. (2) Time spent on the protection shield section (scroll depth + dwell time for Variant B). (3) Post-visit survey (shown to a 20% sample who do NOT submit a proposal): 'What, if anything, prevented you from proposing for this space?' with free-text response. (4) Return rate: do Variant B viewers return to the listing at a higher rate? Run for 3 weeks.",
      "success_criteria": [
        "Variant B listing-to-proposal rate is at least 20% higher than Variant A",
        "At least 50% of Variant B viewers scroll past the protection shield section (indicating they noticed it)",
        "Free-text responses from Variant B non-proposers mention trust/safety concerns less frequently than Variant A non-proposers",
        "Return rate for Variant B is at least equal to Variant A (the shield does not create a 'I already checked, no need to come back' effect)"

      "failure_meaning": "If Variant A outperforms Variant B, the Protection Shield may be activating fears rather than defusing them. In this case, test a subtler version: shield content available on hover/click of a small 'Your Protection' icon, rather than always-visible on the page. If both variants perform equally, the shield is neutral and the real estate may be better used for listing content.",
      "implementation_hint": "The Protection Shield is a self-contained HTML component that can be conditionally rendered based on the A/B test assignment. It requires no additional backend data -- all protection statements are static content. The scroll depth and dwell time tracking can use the Intersection Observer API."

But the Prospect Theory emotional arc (loss-state entry -> gain framing -> endowment acceleration -> vulnerability defusal -> certainty elation -> satisfaction protection) is a connected sequence where each element depends on the preceding ones. A journey-level validation is needed to ensure the full arc creates a coherent emotional experience that exceeds the sum of its individual elements.",

Recruit guests who match the Steve Zhang profile: multi-local, between places or using hotels, analytically inclined. Equip them with a simple daily diary prompt (sent via SMS at 7pm): 'In one sentence, how do you feel about your housing situation today?' Track these guests from discovery through active lease (if they convert) over 8-12 weeks.",

      "test_description": "Recruit 10-15 participants matching the target profile. Enroll them when they first visit Split Lease. Send a daily SMS diary prompt for 8-12 weeks. At key journey moments (search, proposal submission, acceptance, first stay, mid-lease), conduct a 15-minute phone interview to capture detailed emotional state. Code diary entries and interviews for: (1) Dominant emotion per phase. (2) Reference point shifts (can participants articulate what they are comparing to?). (3) Endowment indicators (language that suggests mental ownership before physical possession). (4) Certainty language (expressions of confidence or anxiety about the process). (5) Satisfaction trajectory (are positive sentiments maintained over time?).",
      "success_criteria": [
        "At least 70% of participants' diary entries at the acceptance phase contain certainty/relief language (validating the certainty elation design)",
        "At least 60% of participants who configure a stay in the Plan Your Stay module use possessive language about the space in subsequent diary entries ('my space', 'my place') -- validating endowment acceleration",
        "The emotional arc for participants who convert to active leases follows the predicted trajectory: negative/anxious at discovery -> comparative at search -> anticipatory at proposal -> confident at acceptance -> satisfied during active lease",

      ],
      "failure_meaning": "If the emotional arc does not follow the predicted trajectory, the individual elements may be well-designed but poorly sequenced. If a systematic valley appears at a specific phase (e.g., all participants report anxiety at proposal creation despite the vulnerability defusal), that specific element needs redesign. The diary study reveals emotional patterns that A/B tests cannot capture.",
      "implementation_hint": "Use a simple SMS-based diary tool (e.g., Twilio + Google Sheets). The daily prompt should be one sentence and require a one-sentence response. Phone interviews should be semi-structured with a focus on the guest's emotional state, not the platform's features. This is a qualitative validation that complements the quantitative A/B tests."
