      "problem": "The platform currently presents pricing information as standalone figures: '$80/night', '4-Week Rent: $960', 'Total: $3,840'. These numbers are meaningless in isolation because, as Kahneman demonstrates, all financial evaluations are relative to a reference point. Steve Zhang's reference is Sonder at $90/night. Without an explicit comparison, his System 1 performs a rough, error-prone comparison that systematically disadvantages Split Lease. Here is why: Sonder's $90/night is a complete, certain, all-inclusive price (cleaning, amenities, no setup). Split Lease's $80/night requires the guest to mentally add the value of leave-your-stuff, full kitchen, consistent space, and medium-term savings -- additions that System 1 does not perform automatically. The information architecture creates an asymmetry: Sonder's value is immediately legible, Split Lease's value requires System 2 computation. Kahneman's work on vivid outcomes shows that 'a rich and vivid representation of the outcome reduces the role of probability in the evaluation.' Sonder's price is vivid (one number, everything included). Split Lease's price is abstract (base rate + invisible structural advantages). The information architecture must reverse this asymmetry.",
      "solution": "Restructure all price displays into a three-layer hierarchy that surfaces the reference comparison before the absolute price: LAYER 1 (Primary, largest type): The gain vs. reference. 'Save $120/month vs. Sonder' or 'Save $1,440/year vs. hotels.' This is the first thing the guest reads. It answers the only question that matters: 'Is this better than what I have now?' LAYER 2 (Secondary): The total monthly cost for the guest's specific pattern. '$960/month for 3 nights/week.' This answers: 'Can I afford this?' LAYER 3 (Tertiary, smallest type): The nightly rate and calculation breakdown. '$80/night x 12 nights/month = $960.' This answers: 'How is this calculated?' Additionally, a non-financial value strip below the price: three icons with labels showing structural advantages that have no dollar equivalent in the reference alternative: 'Leave your belongings' (icon: suitcase with checkmark), 'Same space every visit' (icon: home with repeat arrow), 'Full kitchen included' (icon: kitchen). These are vivid, imageable advantages that Kahneman's research shows will reduce the certainty premium the guest demands.",

      "problem": "When a host counters a guest's proposal, the information architecture of the counter-offer display determines whether the guest perceives the negotiation as collaborative (moving toward agreement) or adversarial (losing proposed terms). Kahneman's research on loss aversion in negotiations shows that 'the concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure.' The current journey map shows counter-offers by navigating to a 'Proposal Detail Page' that shows 'the Guest's submitted terms' and the host's changes. If the first information the guest processes is 'your duration was reduced from 16 weeks to 10 weeks,' their System 1 codes a 6-week loss before System 2 can contextualize it. Steve Zhang's analytical nature will amplify this: he will immediately calculate the financial impact of the loss ($80/night x 18 nights x 6 weeks = $8,640 of 'lost' value) before considering whether 10 weeks is actually a good outcome. The information architecture must present what was PRESERVED before what was CHANGED, and what was CHANGED must be framed as a feature, not a deficit.",

This zone should be visually dominant -- large type, green accents, checkmarks. It anchors the guest in what they have gained from the pre-proposal state (nothing) to the current state (agreement on multiple terms). ZONE 2 -- ADJUSTED (25% of visual weight): 'The host suggests this adjustment:' followed by the changed term(s) with a neutral icon (not red, not crossed-out). Duration: 10 weeks (host suggested) vs. your proposal of 16 weeks. Below: 'This reduces your total commitment from $3,840 to $2,400 -- a $1,440 smaller commitment.' Frame the change as a reduction in commitment (a gain in flexibility) rather than a loss of duration. ZONE 3 -- ACTION (5% of visual weight): Two buttons: 'Accept and Secure Your Space' (primary, prominent) and 'Suggest Different Terms' (secondary, subdued).

      "problem": "After a guest commits (proposal submission, counter-offer acceptance, move-in preparation), they enter a waiting state where the platform has their commitment but has not yet delivered the outcome. This is the most psychologically dangerous zone in the journey. Kahneman's certainty effect shows that the gap between 'almost certain' (95%) and 'certain' (100%) is where the most anxiety lives. A guest who has accepted terms but has not received documents is at 95% certainty. A guest who has received documents but has not moved in is at 97%. Each percentage point toward 100% matters disproportionately. Steve Zhang's experience with Sonder's annoying text support (0:35:39) shows that even sophisticated users are sensitive to communication failures during active commitments. The current journey map shows that 'documents are sent' after acceptance, but the guest has no visibility into the timeline. When will documents arrive? When is payment processed? When will the host send check-in instructions? Each unanswered question is a certainty gap that the guest's System 1 fills with worst-case scenarios (Kahneman: 'the mere reminder of a bad event is treated in System 1 as threatening').",

The timeline transforms the abstract future into a concrete sequence, converting uncertainty into certainty step-by-step.

Step 3: 'Payment authorization confirmed' -- upon signature. Step 4: 'Move-in instructions sent by host' -- 72 hours before move-in. Step 5: 'Your space is ready' -- on move-in date. Each step should have three states: upcoming (gray), in progress (purple pulse), complete (green checkmark). The timeline should be visible on the Leases page as a persistent widget, not just in a one-time email. PRE-MOVE-IN TIMELINE: Condenses to the logistical steps. 'Check-in instructions received' (checkmark or pending). 'House Manual available' (checkmark or pending). 'Host contact confirmed' (checkmark). 'Parking instructions' (checkmark). ACTIVE LEASE TIMELINE: Shifts to recurring events. 'Next stay: Tue Mar 5 -- Thu Mar 7.' 'Next payment: Mar 15, $960.' 'Lease ends: Jun 1 (renewal available May 1).'

Kahneman's negativity dominance principle shows that 'bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones.' A single unexpected charge, a single unresponsive host message, or a single confusing date-change process can create a loss that requires 5 positive interactions to offset (Gottman's 5:1 ratio). The Leases page is the guest's primary recurring touchpoint -- they visit it weekly to check schedules, payments, and stay details. The current Leases page shows basic information (active leases, payment history, stay calendar) but does not proactively surface loss-prevention information. It waits for the guest to discover problems rather than intercepting them.

This panel keeps the guest in the gains domain, making small negative events (a late host message, a minor scheduling friction) less impactful because the overall frame is positive. PANEL 2 -- UPCOMING EVENTS (middle-left): Next 3 stays with dates and any pending confirmations. Next payment with amount and date. Any pending date-change requests. This is the certainty panel: everything the guest needs to know about the immediate future. No ambiguity. PANEL 3 -- HOST STATUS (middle-right): Host response time (average and recent). Last message from host. Host rating. This panel gives the guest visibility into the relationship health metric. If host responsiveness degrades, the guest sees it early and the platform can intervene before the guest codes it as a loss. PANEL 4 -- LEASE HEALTH (bottom): Lease progress bar (e.g., 'Week 7 of 10'). Renewal status ('Renewal available starting May 1'). Any action items (cleaning photos to submit, reviews to write).

      "problem": "Kahneman's chapter on rare events reveals a paradox: people either completely ignore rare events or massively overweight them, depending on whether the event is brought to their attention. For a guest evaluating a Split Lease listing, the rare-but-dramatic negative scenarios (scam listing, terrible host, space does not match photos, host cancels day before move-in) are precisely the kind of vivid, emotional events that System 1 overweights when they come to mind. The paradox for the platform is: if the listing page does not address these fears, the guest's System 1 may never think of them (good), or may generate them spontaneously and overweight them massively (catastrophic). Steve Zhang is especially relevant here because he is sophisticated enough to imagine failure modes and analytical enough to demand evidence of their mitigation. He mentions Sonder's annoying support -- but he still uses Sonder, partly because it is a known brand with an implicit safety guarantee. Split Lease, as a marketplace connecting strangers, does not have this implicit safety. The information architecture must defuse rare-event fears without activating them.",
      "solution": "Implement a preemptive risk acknowledgment system that addresses the top 3-4 guest fears BEFORE the guest's System 1 generates them, using a technique that Kahneman's research supports: making the feared event and its mitigation equally vivid, so the mitigation receives the same overweighting as the threat. This means: (1) On the listing detail page, include a 'Your Protection' section positioned AFTER the photo gallery and BEFORE the proposal button. This section uses a 'shield' visual metaphor and addresses fears in this order: 'Verified Host' (host has been vetted, ID confirmed, background check complete -- with a specific badge). 'Accurate Photos' (photos verified within last X days, or host provides a recent photo/video tour). 'Payment Protected' (your payment is held in escrow until 24 hours after check-in -- if the space does not match the listing, full refund). 'Cancellation Coverage' (if the host cancels, we find you an equivalent space or refund 100% + X% inconvenience credit). (2) The critical information architecture principle: each protection statement must be EQUALLY VIVID as the fear it defuses. Kahneman shows that 'a rich and vivid representation of the outcome reduces the role of probability in the evaluation.' If the fear is vivid (arriving to find a scam listing) and the protection is abstract ('we have a refund policy'), the fear wins.
