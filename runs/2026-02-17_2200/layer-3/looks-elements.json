      "problem": "Kahneman's Prospect Theory shows that people evaluate outcomes as gains or losses from a reference point, not as absolute values. The current listing card and listing detail page display price as a standalone nightly rate -- a number with no reference context. This forces the guest's System 1 to perform an unguided comparison against their internal reference (Steve Zhang's reference: Sonder at $90/night). When the comparison is unguided, System 1 defaults to the simplest heuristic: 'Is this number lower than the number I know?' This crude comparison misses the structural advantages (leave belongings, full kitchen, same space). The visual design must make the gain visible before the price, using color, typography, and spatial hierarchy to ensure the gain is processed first.",
      "solution": "Design a three-tier visual price module used on both listing cards and listing detail pages. TIER 1 (Top, largest): Gain badge. A pill-shaped badge in the savings color (teal-green on purple gradient background) containing the monthly savings amount: 'Save $120/mo vs. hotels.' Typography: DM Sans 600 weight, --text-md (16px), white text on teal-green badge. The badge sits at the top of the price area, demanding first-read attention. TIER 2 (Middle): Monthly total. The primary price display showing the guest's actual monthly cost for their configured stay pattern. Typography: Inter 700 weight, --text-2xl (28px), --text-dark (#1a1a1a). Subtitle in Inter 400 weight, --text-sm (12px), --text-gray (#6b7280): 'for 3 nights/week.' TIER 3 (Bottom, smallest): Nightly rate breakdown. Typography: Inter 400 weight, --text-sm (12px), --text-light-gray (#9ca3af). '$80/night x 12 nights/month.' Expandable chevron for full calculation. NON-FINANCIAL VALUE STRIP: Below the price tiers, a horizontal row of 3 icon-label pairs: suitcase-checkmark 'Leave your stuff' | home-repeat 'Same space' | kitchen 'Full kitchen.' Icons at 20px, labels in DM Sans 400, --text-xs (11px), --text-gray. Separated by subtle vertical dividers (--border-light).",

Kahneman's loss aversion research shows that losses are weighted approximately 2:1 against equivalent gains. Standard UI patterns for showing changes -- red text, strikethrough, minus signs, diff views -- are visual loss signals that activate System 1 threat detection before the guest processes the content. A red strikethrough on '16 weeks' with a replacement of '10 weeks' creates an immediate System 1 response: 'I lost something.' The visual weight of the loss (red, prominent) overwhelms the logical assessment (10 weeks of stable housing is still a massive gain from zero). The visual design must present changes using neutral or positive signals that allow System 2 to evaluate the counter rationally.",

The guest must read an email, parse the text, identify what is done and what is pending, and construct a mental model of where they are in the process.

The Leases page is the guest's weekly touchpoint, but it currently functions as a transactional display (payments made, stays scheduled) rather than a reinforcement mechanism. The absence of a visible running savings total means the guest has no ongoing positive frame to buffer against minor negative events (a late host response, a date-change friction). Kahneman's work on fairness shows that 'people who learned that the merchant was now charging less for a product they had recently bought at a higher price reduced their future purchases by 15%' -- retroactive loss perception is real. The visual design must continuously reinforce the 'I am saving money' frame to prevent any single negative event from flipping the guest's overall assessment to negative.",
      "solution": "Design the active lease section of the Leases page with a Savings Dashboard as the top-most, most visually prominent component. The dashboard uses the following visual structure: SAVINGS HERO (top card, full width): Background: --gain-green-light (#CCFBF1) with a subtle left-aligned illustration of a piggy bank or savings graph. Left side: Large savings number in Inter 700, --text-2xl (28px), --gain-green (#0D9488): '$720 saved so far.' Below: DM Sans 400, --text-sm, --text-gray: 'vs. hotels for the same nights. Updated through February 2026.' Right side: A compact sparkline chart (60px tall, 120px wide) showing monthly savings trend. The sparkline uses --gain-green for the line and --gain-green-light fill. This card is the emotional anchor: every time the guest visits the Leases page, the first thing they see is a positive number that reinforces their decision. UPCOMING EVENTS STRIP (below savings hero): A horizontal scrollable row of date cards. Each card: --bg-white background, --rounded-lg corners, --shadow-sm. Inside: Month abbreviation in DM Sans 600, --text-sm, --secondary-purple. Day number in Inter 700, --text-xl. Status label below: 'Confirmed' in --text-sm, --secondary-purple, or 'Pending' in --text-sm, --text-gray. The confirmed/pending visual states use the same solid/hollow language as the Certainty Timeline (looks-003) for cross-component consistency. PAYMENT NEXT CARD (below events): Compact card showing next payment amount and date. Uses neutral styling: --bg-light background, Inter 400, --text-base. The payment should NOT be visually prominent -- prominence would code it as a loss (money leaving). It should be visible but recessive, communicating 'this is handled, no action needed.' LEASE PROGRESS BAR (bottom): A horizontal progress bar showing weeks completed. Fill: --gradient-purple-primary. Background: --bg-light-gray. Label: 'Week 7 of 10 completed' in DM Sans 400, --text-sm, --text-gray. The progress bar uses the word 'completed' (achievement frame) not 'remaining' (countdown/loss frame).",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's research on rare events shows that 'when an unlikely event becomes the focus of attention, we will assign it much more weight than its probability deserves.' For guests evaluating a listing from a marketplace of strangers, the rare-but-dramatic negative events (scam, terrible host, space mismatch) are the threat that System 1 scans for. Steve Zhang uses Sonder partly because it is a known brand with implicit safety guarantees. Split Lease, as a peer-to-peer marketplace, must make its explicit protections visually as credible and prominent as Sonder's brand implicit trust. The visual design challenge is to defuse rare-event fears without activating them. This means: do not use warning imagery (exclamation marks, alert colors), do not use defensive language ('We protect you from...'), and do not draw attention to specific negative scenarios. Instead, use confident, forward-leaning visual language that communicates 'this is handled' rather than 'we know you are worried.'",
      "solution": "Design a Protection Shield Module that appears on the listing detail page between the photo gallery and the proposal button. The module uses a horizontal card layout with a subtle but confident visual treatment: CONTAINER: Full-width card with --bg-off-white (rgb(252,250,255)) background, --rounded-xl corners, no shadow (shadows imply elevation/urgency; protection should feel grounded and permanent). Top: A small shield icon (16px) in --secondary-purple next to the heading 'Your Protection' in DM Sans 600, --text-md, --primary-purple (#31135D). PROTECTION ITEMS: 4 items in a horizontal row (2x2 grid on mobile). Each item: a compact circular icon (24px, --bg-light background, icon in --secondary-purple) + title in Inter 500, --text-sm-md (13px), --text-dark + subtitle in Inter 400, --text-xs (11px), --text-gray. Items: (1) Shield-check icon: 'Verified Host' / 'ID and background confirmed.' (2) Camera icon: 'Photo Guarantee' / 'Listing photos verified recently.' (3) Lock icon: 'Payment Protected' / 'Held in escrow until check-in.' (4) Refresh-circle icon: 'Cancel Coverage' / 'Full refund if host cancels.' Each subtitle is one line, under 35 characters. The entire module is scannable in 3-4 seconds. Expanding any item reveals a single paragraph of detail for analytical guests like Steve. VISUAL TONE: The module uses muted purple tones (--primary-purple heading, --secondary-purple icons) -- the same palette as the rest of the brand. This is intentional: protection should not look like a separate, alarming module. It should look like a natural part of the listing, as integral as the photo gallery or the price. The absence of green checkmarks (which could imply 'passing a test') and the absence of any warm colors (which could imply 'warning') keeps the module in the calm, confident register.",
