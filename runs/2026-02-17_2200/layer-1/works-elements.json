      "problem": "Guests arrive at Split Lease with a pre-existing reference point from their current alternative (Sonder at $90/night, Airbnb at variable prices, hotel at $170/night, or free but painful friend-couch arrangements). Kahneman's Prospect Theory demonstrates that all subsequent evaluations are coded as gains or losses relative to this reference point -- NOT as absolute values. Steve Zhang explicitly anchors on Sonder at $90/night in Boston. The current platform displays listing prices as nightly rates without any reference comparison. This forces the guest's System 2 to perform the translation ('Is $80/night better or worse than Sonder at $90/night? But wait, Sonder includes cleaning, and I don't need a kitchen...'), which is effortful, error-prone, and biased toward the vivid known alternative. Kahneman's bat-and-ball finding shows that even simple math is done wrong when an intuitive but incorrect answer is available. If a guest sees '$80/night' and their System 1 says 'that is close to Sonder and Sonder is certain,' the guest leaves. The platform has lost them to a cognitive illusion because the structural advantage (medium-term, no tourist tax, leave belongings, continuous space) was never surfaced against the reference point.",
      "solution": "Build an explicit reference-point comparison into every listing display and the proposal creation flow. The system should: (1) During onboarding or first search, ask the guest what they currently pay for accommodation and what platform they use. This captures the reference point. (2) On every listing card and listing detail page, show a 'vs. your current option' comparison that calculates the monthly total for the guest's specific use pattern (e.g., 3 nights/week x 4 weeks = 12 nights x $80 = $960/month vs. Sonder at $90/night x 12 nights = $1,080/month -- you save $120/month PLUS you keep your stuff there). (3) Frame the comparison as a GAIN from the reference point, never as an absolute price. Kahneman shows that gain-framing is essential when the gain is moderate -- people are risk-averse in the gains domain and need to see the gain clearly to choose the uncertain option (Split Lease) over the certain one (Sonder). (4) Include the non-financial gains visually: 'Leave your laptop setup on the desk' with an icon, 'Same space every visit' with an icon, 'Full kitchen included' with an icon. These make the abstract advantage vivid, which Kahneman shows reduces the certainty premium the guest demands.",

      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "search", "listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's fourfold pattern shows that people currently experiencing losses are risk-seeking -- they are willing to try novel, uncertain options that loss-averse people would reject. Steve Zhang is a textbook loss-state guest: no permanent lease, storing belongings with friends, house-sitting, living out of a suitcase at his girlfriend's place. He explicitly describes his situation as 'very inefficient.' This loss-state creates a time-limited acquisition window: Steve is more receptive to trying Split Lease NOW than he will be once he settles into any stable arrangement (even a suboptimal one like a Sonder monthly). Once he establishes a new status quo, the endowment effect and status quo bias will lock him into that arrangement and make him resistant to switching. The current platform treats all guests identically -- the same search flow, the same listing pages, the same proposal process. It does not recognize or capitalize on the loss-state window. A guest who is housing-unstable and browsing at 11pm on a Tuesday is treated the same as a guest casually exploring options from a comfortable apartment.",
      "solution": "Create a differentiated acquisition path for loss-state guests that compresses the time from discovery to proposal. This means: (1) In the discovery/onboarding flow, ask a qualification question: 'What's your current housing situation?' with options like 'I have a stable lease,' 'I'm between places,' 'I'm using hotels/Sonder,' 'I'm staying with friends/family.' Guests who select loss-state options enter an accelerated funnel. (2) The accelerated funnel front-loads certainty: immediately show available listings in the guest's target area with move-in dates within the next 2 weeks, total monthly costs (not nightly rates), and one-click proposal creation with smart defaults. (3) Reduce the number of decisions required. Loss-state guests are already making decisions under stress -- Kahneman shows that people 'in the losses' process options differently, focusing on loss-reduction rather than gain-maximization. The funnel should emphasize what they STOP losing (no more suitcase, no more imposing on friends, no more setup/teardown) rather than what they gain. (4) Create urgency through honest scarcity signals: 'This space is available starting Feb 20. 2 other guests are evaluating it.'

      "journey_phases": ["proposal_creation", "negotiation", "acceptance", "move_in"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's certainty effect demonstrates that moving from 95% to 100% certainty has disproportionate psychological impact -- far greater than any other 5% probability change. At every commitment escalation point in the guest journey (submitting a proposal, receiving a counter-offer, accepting terms, preparing to move in), the guest faces uncertainty about what happens next. Steve Zhang's background reveals why this matters especially for analytical guests: he understands uncertainty quantitatively (schedule certainty vs. uncertainty discussion at 0:17:25), he has experienced the pain of uncertainty (digital nomadism, no permanent lease, unclear work-from-office requirements at 0:06:27), and he will not commit resources to an uncertain outcome when a certain alternative exists (Sonder). The current platform's proposal flow introduces multiple points of uncertainty: Will the host respond? How long will it take? What if they counter? What exactly is the cancellation policy? What happens to my payment if the host cancels? Each uncertainty is a 'probability less than 100%' that triggers the certainty effect -- the guest overweights the small chance of a bad outcome and underweights the high chance of a good one.",
      "solution": "At every commitment escalation point, deliver explicit certainty about what happens next, when it happens, and what the guest can do if it does not happen. This means: (1) Proposal submission: immediately show 'Your proposal has been sent. Hosts typically respond within [X] hours. If the host does not respond within 48 hours, your proposal expires and you are charged nothing.' The 'charged nothing' is the certainty guarantee that eliminates the loss-aversion trigger. (2) Counter-offer receipt: show exactly what changed, what did NOT change, and the total financial impact. Frame changes in gain terms: 'The host proposed 10 weeks instead of 16. This reduces your total commitment by $X while keeping your nightly rate the same.' (3) Acceptance: deliver a comprehensive 'What Happens Now' timeline -- documents in X hours, payment processed on Y date, move-in instructions sent Z days before. The timeline converts the probabilistic future into a certain sequence. (4) Pre-move-in: send the House Manual, check-in instructions, host contact info, and a 'What to bring' checklist 72 hours before. The guest should arrive with zero unresolved questions. Kahneman shows that the certainty premium people pay (in the insurance and settlement examples) can be captured by the platform as conversion rate improvement -- guests who receive certainty convert at dramatically higher rates because they do not need to pay the certainty premium by choosing the safe alternative (Sonder).",

      "journey_phases": ["listing_evaluation", "proposal_creation", "negotiation"],
      "problem": "Kahneman's endowment effect research shows that people value things they own approximately 2x more than identical things they do not own. Critically, this effect begins with mental ownership, not just physical possession. A guest who has imagined themselves in a space, configured their ideal dates, and calculated their monthly cost has begun to 'own' the outcome -- even before submitting a proposal. The current platform does not deliberately accelerate this mental ownership. Listing pages show photos and prices but do not help the guest project themselves into the space. The proposal form collects terms but does not reinforce the imagined future. This is a missed opportunity: if the platform can accelerate mental ownership before the commitment point (proposal submission), the endowment effect will make the guest reluctant to abandon the process. Not submitting the proposal will feel like a loss (losing the space they already mentally inhabit), rather than a neutral non-action. Steve Zhang is particularly susceptible to this because he is currently housing-unstable -- his desire for a space is acute, and any listing that matches his needs will trigger intense mental ownership because it represents relief from his loss state.",
      "solution": "Design the listing evaluation and proposal creation flow to deliberately accelerate mental ownership through personalization and projection. This means: (1) On the listing detail page, after the guest has viewed photos and price, offer a 'Plan Your Stay' interactive section that asks for their target dates and shows a calendar with their specific nights highlighted. The moment they see THEIR dates on the calendar, they have mentally moved in. (2) Show a personalized cost summary that uses the guest's name: 'Steve, your 3-night/week stay in Cambridge would cost $960/month -- $120 less than Sonder.' The personalization triggers ownership because it is no longer a generic listing; it is Steve's arrangement. (3) During proposal creation, show a 'Your Space' summary card that includes the listing photo, the guest's configured dates, and the total cost -- all presented as if the arrangement already exists. This is the 'mug in front of you' from Kahneman's experiment: the Sellers who had the mug in front of them valued it 2x more. (4) If the host counters, frame the counter not as a change to 'the listing' but as a change to 'your arrangement.'

The endowment effect and status quo bias now work for retention -- but only if the platform does not actively undermine them. Kahneman's research shows two risks: (1) Negative experiences are coded as losses and weighted 2:1 against positive experiences. One bad interaction (payment confusion, unresponsive host, difficult date change) creates a loss that requires two positive experiences to offset. (2) The guest's reference point rises over time -- they begin to expect not just the space but the entire support system (responsive host, flexible dates, transparent payments). Any failure to meet the rising expectation is a loss. Steve Zhang's situation is especially important here because he is analytical and will track his ROI continuously. If the monthly cost creeps up, if date changes become difficult, if the host becomes less responsive, Steve will code these as losses from his established reference and begin evaluating alternatives. The platform currently has no system for monitoring guest reference points or proactively preventing loss events.",

This means: (1) Proactive payment transparency: show the guest their running total, their savings vs. the reference alternative (Sonder/hotel), and any upcoming charges BEFORE they occur. No surprise charges ever. Kahneman: 'Unfairly imposing losses on people can be risky if the victims are in a position to retaliate.' Payment surprises are perceived as unfair losses. (2) Host responsiveness monitoring: if the host's response time to messages or date-change requests degrades, the platform should intervene proactively (nudge the host, offer the guest a direct support contact). (3) Date Change Tool framing: when a date change is processed, frame the result in terms of what was PRESERVED, not what changed. 'Your 3-night Tuesday-Thursday arrangement continues. Wednesday has been swapped to Thursday for Week 7.' The unchanged elements should be visually dominant. (4) Lease renewal framing: as the lease end approaches, frame non-renewal as a loss: 'Your space in Cambridge ends on [date]. Renewing preserves your $960/month rate and your setup.' The endowment effect makes this framing honest, not manipulative -- the guest genuinely will lose something they value. (5) Mid-lease check-in: at the halfway point, show the guest a 'Your Stay So Far' summary: nights stayed, total saved vs. alternatives, host rating.

      "problem": "Kahneman's research on negotiation shows that 'loss aversion creates an asymmetry that makes agreements difficult to reach. The concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure.' In Split Lease negotiation, when a host counters a guest's proposal (e.g., reducing duration from 16 to 10 weeks), the guest's System 1 immediately codes every change as a loss from their proposed terms. The guest's proposal has become their reference point -- not the pre-proposal state of having no space at all. This is the endowment effect applied to proposal terms: the guest 'owns' their proposed dates and duration. The current platform shows counter-offers as changes to the proposal, which highlights what was lost. This framing maximizes loss aversion and minimizes the probability of acceptance. The result: negotiation rounds increase, time-to-agreement extends, and guests who would have accepted reasonable counters abandon because the loss signal is too strong.",
      "solution": "Redesign the counter-offer display to neutralize loss aversion through deliberate framing. This means: (1) Lead with what was PRESERVED: 'The host agreed to your nightly rate of $80 and your preferred move-in date.' These are gains from the pre-proposal state (having nothing). (2) Present changes as the host's contribution, not the guest's concession: 'The host is offering 10 weeks instead of 16 -- this reduces your total commitment from $3,840 to $2,400.' Frame the change as a smaller commitment, not a shorter stay. (3) Show the 'negotiation distance' visually: a bar showing original proposal, counter-offer, and how close they are to agreement. Kahneman's research on negotiating a shrinking vs. expanding pie applies: if the guest perceives the negotiation as 'allocating gains' (moving toward having a space), they will be more flexible. If they perceive it as 'allocating losses' (losing proposed terms), they will be rigid. (4) Provide a one-click 'Accept counter' with a gain-framed summary: 'Accept and secure your space in Cambridge starting [date].' The word 'secure' activates the certainty effect -- accepting converts an uncertain negotiation into a certain outcome. (5) If the guest wants to counter-counter, provide smart suggestions that are calibrated to the midpoint, making the guest feel they are gaining ground rather than defending territory.",

Negotiations over a shrinking pie are especially difficult, because they require an allocation of losses. People tend to be much more easygoing when they bargain over an expanding pie.' The counter-offer display must present the negotiation as an expanding pie (both parties moving toward an agreement) not a shrinking one (guest losing proposed terms)."
