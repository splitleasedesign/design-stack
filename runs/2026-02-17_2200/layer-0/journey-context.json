    "discovery": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Steve discovers Split Lease not through marketing but through his friend Joyce, who frames it as 'a marketplace for multi-locals.' This is critical through a Prospect Theory lens: Steve's reference point at discovery is already anchored by his current painful status quo -- he has no permanent lease, is house-sitting in Boston, storing belongings with friends, and living out of a suitcase at his girlfriend's house. His reference point is a state of loss (no stable housing), which means Split Lease enters his awareness not as a speculative gain but as potential loss-reduction. Kahneman's work on reference points shows that people in a loss state are risk-seeking -- Steve is primed to take action. Additionally, the social proof from Joyce (a trusted, high-status friend and advisor) functions as what Kahneman calls 'anchoring through association': the platform inherits Joyce's credibility before Steve even sees it.",

      },
      "dropout_risk": "Medium. Steve is analytically sophisticated and will evaluate Split Lease against Sonder and other alternatives. If the platform does not immediately signal 'this is different from what you already know,' his System 1 will categorize it as 'another Airbnb variant' and disengage.

He mentions Sonder explicitly ('I also say to Sonder quite a bit... in Boston, I can get it down to like 90 a month'). This is his price reference point. Kahneman's prospect theory shows that all subsequent pricing will be evaluated as gains or losses relative to this anchor. If Split Lease shows listings above $90/night without immediately explaining the structural difference (monthly rate, no cleaning fees, no tourist tax, leave your stuff), Steve will code the price as a loss relative to his Sonder reference. The certainty effect also applies: Sonder offers a known, certain experience. Split Lease offers an uncertain one (Who is the host? Will the space match photos? Can I trust a stranger's home?). The certainty premium means Steve requires Split Lease to be significantly cheaper or significantly better to overcome the certainty advantage of Sonder.",

If search results do not immediately surface the medium-term savings narrative and differentiate from Sonder/Airbnb, he will leave.

Steve's specific mention of 'I don't need a kitchen' reveals he is already making tradeoff calculations -- sacrificing kitchen access to reduce cost. Split Lease must show that he does NOT have to make this tradeoff."

    },
    "listing_evaluation": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "This is where the endowment effect and loss aversion collide. When Steve opens a specific listing, he begins to mentally 'try on' the space. Kahneman's endowment effect research shows that even brief mental ownership increases perceived value -- but it also increases the pain of discovering deal-breakers. For an analytical guest like Steve, listing evaluation is a two-system process: System 1 responds to photos and first impressions (does this feel like a place I could live?), while System 2 runs the financial math (nightly rate x nights x weeks = total cost vs Sonder). The critical insight from Prospect Theory is that Steve's evaluation of a listing is NOT about the absolute quality of the space. It is about gains and losses relative to his reference points: Sonder price, his friend's house in Boston (free but cramped), and the abstract ideal of having his own stable place. Any listing feature that falls below his reference point (smaller than expected, farther from transit, noisier neighborhood) is coded as a LOSS and weighted 2x more heavily than features that exceed his reference point.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional": "Engaged but guarded. The analytical mind is running calculations. Emotional investment increases as photos create mental occupancy. Anxiety about whether this is 'real' or 'too good to be true' -- the rare events overweighting from Kahneman means Steve will overweight the small probability of scams or terrible host experiences.",
        "knowledge": "Deep. Steve understands the business model (he's been briefed on anchor/hot-deal matching, tax advantages, medium-term structure). But knowledge of the specific space and host is zero.",
        "commitment": "Medium-low. Mental ownership begins but is fragile. One bad signal (unclear photos, suspicious pricing, no host verification) triggers loss aversion and exit.",
        "data": "Steve evaluates: price relative to $90/night Sonder, distance to transit/work, whether he can store his belongings, host reliability signals."
      },
      "dropout_risk": "Very high. This is the phase where the most guests abandon. Kahneman's work on rare events shows that guests overweight dramatic negative outcomes (bad host, scam, arriving to find space unlike photos) even when the probability is very low. Steve explicitly mentions Sonder's text support being annoying (0:35:39) -- he notices operational friction. Any friction on the listing page (unclear rules, confusing pricing display, no host verification badge) will activate the same pattern.",

          "prospect_theory_note": "The current arrangement is coded as a loss (inefficient). But it is a KNOWN loss. Status quo bias means Steve will tolerate this known loss rather than risk an unknown loss (bad Split Lease experience) unless the listing makes the gain vivid and certain."

          "prospect_theory_note": "Steve's status quo is actively painful. He is 'in the losses' as Kahneman describes the poor -- where all choices are between losses. This makes him more risk-seeking than a comfortable guest, which is an opportunity: he is more likely to try Split Lease than someone with stable housing."
        }
      ]
    },
    "proposal_creation": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Creating a proposal is the moment of maximal loss aversion activation. The guest must commit specific terms (dates, duration, price) and send them to a stranger. From a Prospect Theory perspective, this is a high-stakes gamble: the guest is risking rejection (a loss of time and emotional investment), risking overpaying (a financial loss), and risking the uncertainty of whether the host will be reasonable. The endowment effect works in reverse here: Steve does not yet 'own' the space, so the pain of potentially losing access to it is lower. But the mental investment of configuring a proposal -- choosing dates, calculating total cost, imagining himself in the space -- creates psychological ownership. Once he has configured the proposal, he has mentally moved in. Not sending it now feels like a loss (loss of the envisioned future). The certainty effect is paramount: Steve needs to know EXACTLY what happens after he submits. If there is ambiguity about the process (Will the host respond? How long will it take? What if they counter?), the uncertainty creates a certainty deficit that his System 1 will code as risk.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional": "Tense. The commitment threshold is approaching. Fear of rejection and fear of bad outcome compete with desire for the space. Steve's analytical nature means he will want to understand every term before committing.",
        "knowledge": "Must be high by this point. If Steve does not understand anchor vs hot-deal matching, lease style implications, or cancellation policies, he will not submit.",
        "commitment": "Medium-high. He has invested time evaluating. The sunk cost is real (Kahneman notes people overvalue sunk costs). But the proposal is not yet sent.",
        "data": "Steve needs: exact total cost for his planned duration, comparison to Sonder monthly cost, cancellation terms, what happens if host counters."
      },
      "dropout_risk": "High. The proposal creation form is where analytical guests like Steve encounter the full complexity of the platform. If the pricing display does not match his mental model (he thinks in monthly costs, not nightly rates), the translation burden triggers depletion. Kahneman's bat-and-ball problem: if the form shows $80/night and Steve's System 1 calculates '$80 x 30 = $2,400/month -- that's way more than Sonder,' he will leave without realizing the actual monthly cost is lower due to the part-time structure.",

          "prospect_theory_note": "Steve already understands the resegmentation math -- but he learned it through conversation with Igor, not from a platform interface. The proposal creation screen must replicate this insight visually: show the hotel reference price, then the Split Lease price, framing the difference as a gain."
        }
      ]
    },
    "negotiation": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Negotiation is where Kahneman's work on concessions and loss aversion in bargaining applies directly. 'The concessions you make to me are my gains, but they are your losses; they cause you much more pain than they give me pleasure.' If the host counters Steve's proposal (e.g., reducing duration from 16 to 10 weeks as in the journey map), Steve will code this as a loss from his proposed terms -- even though the counter may be perfectly reasonable. The reference point has shifted: Steve's proposal is now his reference, and any deviation is a loss. The dual entitlements principle applies: Steve feels entitled to his proposed terms, and the host feels entitled to their own. The platform must frame counter-offers not as losses ('Your duration was reduced') but as gains from a neutral reference ('The host has offered you 10 weeks at the same nightly rate'). Steve's analytical background means he may be more rational about this than average, but his System 1 will still register the initial loss signal before System 2 overrides it.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional": "Vulnerable. A counter-offer triggers loss aversion (my proposed terms were rejected). Even a reasonable counter feels like a setback. Steve's ego as an analytical thinker means he may have calibrated his proposal carefully and will feel the counter implies his judgment was wrong.",
        "knowledge": "Must understand that negotiation is normal and expected, not a sign of failure.",
        "commitment": "High but fragile. Steve has invested significantly. But the endowment effect now works against the platform: Steve is 'endowed' with his original proposal terms and will resist changes.",
        "data": "Steve needs: clear display of what changed, what stayed the same, and the total financial impact of the changes."
      },
      "dropout_risk": "Medium-high. Kahneman's research on defending the status quo applies: 'Loss aversion creates an asymmetry that makes agreements difficult to reach.' If the counter-offer display emphasizes what was lost (shorter duration, different dates) rather than what was preserved or gained, Steve will feel the negotiation is adversarial and may abandon.",
      "key_quotes": [
        {
          "timestamp": "0:17:25",
          "quote": "One of the things that multi locals have is schedule uncertainty. They have a sense of schedule certainty in a sense of schedule uncertainty.",
          "prospect_theory_note": "Igor identifies schedule uncertainty as the core tension. In negotiation, a counter-offer that changes dates activates uncertainty, which Steve's System 1 codes as a threat. The platform must provide certainty signals throughout negotiation -- confirmed dates should be visually locked and immovable."
        }
      ]
    },
    "acceptance": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Acceptance is where the certainty effect reaches maximum power. Kahneman shows that moving from 95% to 100% certainty is psychologically massive -- far more impactful than moving from 50% to 55%. The moment of acceptance transforms a probable outcome into a certain one. This is the platform's single most powerful emotional moment. But Kahneman also warns about the endowment effect kicking in immediately: the instant Steve accepts, he mentally owns the space. From this point forward, any problem (delayed documents, unclear move-in instructions, unexpected fees) is coded as a loss from his newly established reference point of 'I have a place.' The platform must deliver flawlessly from this moment because any disappointment is amplified by loss aversion.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional": "Relief and elation. The certainty of having a place after months of instability is profoundly positive. But this relief immediately creates a new, higher reference point that makes any subsequent disappointment feel worse.",
        "knowledge": "Must know exactly what happens next: when documents arrive, when payment is processed, when they can move in, who to contact.",
        "commitment": "Very high. The acceptance is a psychological point of no return.",
        "data": "Steve needs: confirmation of all agreed terms, timeline for next steps, contact information for host, payment schedule."
      },
      "dropout_risk": "Low for abandonment, but HIGH for disappointment-driven negative reviews if the post-acceptance experience has any friction. Kahneman's loss aversion ratio (2:1) means that one bad post-acceptance experience (late documents, confusing payment) erases the positive effect of two good experiences.",
      "key_quotes": [

          "timestamp": "0:07:42",
          "quote": "You can just have a satellite home and then have a permanent address. And your satellite home doesn't have to cost that much.",
          "prospect_theory_note": "The acceptance moment is when 'satellite home' moves from concept to reality. The endowment effect starts here. Steve now OWNS this concept -- taking it away (through friction, confusion, or delay) will feel like theft."
        }
      ]
    },
    "move_in": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "Move-in is the first moment of reality testing against the reference point established at acceptance. Kahneman's research on the endowment effect shows that once Steve has mentally owned the space (from acceptance onward), his reference point includes every positive detail he imagined. The actual space is evaluated against this imagined version. Any discrepancy -- even minor ones (slightly different furniture arrangement, neighborhood noise, unclear parking) -- is coded as a loss. This is amplified by what Steve has been living through: months of no permanent space, suitcase living, friend's couches. His relief reference is extremely high, making the move-in a moment of extraordinary emotional stakes. The rare events overweighting from Kahneman also applies: Steve will be hyper-alert to any sign that something is wrong (bad lock, stained mattress, unclear instructions) because his System 1 is scanning for threats in an unfamiliar environment.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional": "Extremely heightened. Mix of excitement (finally having a space) and anxiety (is it going to be what I expected?). First impressions of the physical space will be dominated by System 1 and coded permanently.",

      },
      "dropout_risk": "Low (he has already committed), but VERY HIGH for negative sentiment formation. A bad move-in experience creates a loss-aversion reference that poisons the entire active lease period.

          "prospect_theory_note": "Steve is acutely aware of setup costs. The move-in phase IS the setup cost. If it is friction-filled, his ROI calculation turns negative immediately, and he will code the entire Split Lease experience as a loss relative to his other options (Sonder requires zero setup)."

      ]
    },
    "active_lease": {
      "what_this_lens_reveals": "The active lease phase is where status quo bias and the endowment effect work FOR the platform -- if the initial experience is good. Once Steve is settled, his reference point shifts to 'I have a stable space.' Now, losing the space (lease ending, host problems, date conflicts) is coded as a devastating loss, while the ongoing experience is coded as the neutral status quo. This creates natural retention. But Kahneman's work on goals as reference points adds a nuance: if Steve sets expectations for the active lease (e.g., 'I should be able to change dates easily,' 'The host should be responsive'), not meeting those goals feels like a loss even though the absolute situation is good. The Date Change Tool is critical here: Kahneman's cabdriver study shows that people with daily targets work harder on bad days and coast on good days. Analogously, Steve will be most frustrated with the platform when things go wrong (date change needed urgently) and least attentive when things are fine. The platform's active lease experience must be designed for the bad days, not the good ones.",
      "user_state": {
        "emotional": "Settled and stable -- unless a problem arises, in which case anxiety spikes disproportionately (loss aversion). The endowment effect means Steve values the space far more now than he did when evaluating it.",

The platform must provide both types of certainty, but for Steve's segment, numerical certainty is the binding constraint.

      "description": "Kahneman shows that the endowment effect increases with duration of ownership and with the degree to which a good is held 'for use' rather than 'for exchange.' A Split Lease space -- where the guest leaves their belongings, sets up their workspace, learns the neighborhood -- is the ultimate 'for use' good. The endowment effect will be very strong after even a few weeks of active lease. This means retention during the active lease is nearly automatic IF the initial experience is good. But it also means that the loss of the space (lease ending, host withdrawing, forced move) will be experienced as devastating. The platform must manage lease-end transitions with extreme care, ideally offering renewal or transfer options that prevent the loss-coding entirely.",

          "detail": "Kahneman: 'Selling goods that one would normally use activates regions of the brain that are associated with disgust and pain.' A Split Lease space is used, not traded. The endowment effect will be maximal. The loss aversion ratio may exceed the typical 2:1 for spaces where guests have left personal belongings."
