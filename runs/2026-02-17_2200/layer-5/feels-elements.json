      "problem": "Steve arrives at Split Lease not from a place of curiosity but from a place of pain. He has no lease, stores belongings with friends, is house-sitting in Boston, and lives out of a suitcase at his girlfriend's house. Kahneman's research on reference points shows that Steve is 'in the losses' -- all his current options are suboptimal. His System 1 is scanning for loss-reduction, not gain-maximization. The platform's current discovery experience treats all guests as curious explorers. But a loss-state guest does not want to explore -- they want to stop losing. If the platform's first impression is aspirational ('Live like a local!'), Steve's System 1 will code it as irrelevant to his immediate pain and dismiss it. The emotional design must meet him where he is: in the losses, looking for relief.",
      "solution": "The discovery experience should mirror the guest's situation back to them before offering a solution. On the landing page or search results page, when a loss-state guest is detected (via the situation assessment in behaves-005 or via the referring context -- Joyce's recommendation), show a headline that reflects their identity: 'For people who are between places.' Subtitle: 'A space that is yours. Leave your things. Come back anytime.' The copy does not sell -- it acknowledges. The emotional architecture is: recognition ('you are between places') -> relief ('there is a space that is yours') -> possibility ('leave your things, come back anytime'). The visual treatment uses warm, settled imagery (a desk with a laptop left open, a closet with clothes hanging, a kitchen with a coffee mug) rather than aspirational travel photography. The goal is to make Steve feel seen, not sold to.",

Kahneman's endowment effect shows that the gap between Sellers (who have the mug) and Choosers (who could get it) is massive -- and the only difference is possession. On the listing page, the guest is a Chooser. After configuring their stay, they should feel like a Seller -- protecting 'their' arrangement. But the current listing experience does not create this emotional transition. Photos show a space, prices show numbers, but nothing helps the guest project themselves into the space. Without this projection, the guest remains emotionally at arm's length, and the proposal feels like a gamble rather than a formalization of something they already own.",
      "solution": "Design the listing evaluation experience to create progressive emotional ownership through three micro-moments: (1) The Photo Projection: after the guest views 3+ photos, show a subtle overlay on the last photo: 'Imagine your laptop on this desk. Your coffee in this kitchen.' The copy is specific to the room shown in the photo (desk -> laptop, kitchen -> coffee). This is the first ownership seed. (2) The Configuration Lock-In: as the guest configures their stay in the Plan Your Stay module (behaves-002), each selection triggers a subtle micro-animation on the 'Your Space' preview card. Selecting days makes the mini-calendar fill with purple dots. Choosing a start date makes the date appear in large type. Each addition builds the feeling of the space becoming theirs. (3) The Pre-Proposal Summary: before the Submit button, show a card titled 'Your Arrangement' (not 'Proposal Summary') with the listing photo, their configured dates, and their monthly cost. The word 'Your' appears three times. This is the endowment effect trigger: the arrangement exists, it is theirs, and submitting the proposal simply formalizes it.",

      "problem": "Acceptance is the single most powerful emotional moment in the guest journey. Kahneman shows that moving from 95% to 100% certainty is qualitatively different from any other probability change. For Steve, who has been housing-unstable for months, the acceptance transforms a probable future into a certain one: he HAS a space. But this powerful positive moment immediately creates a new risk: the endowment effect kicks in at acceptance, establishing a high reference point. Any post-acceptance friction (delayed documents, confusing payment, unclear move-in instructions) is coded as a devastating loss from this new reference. The platform must maximize the positive emotion of acceptance while engineering the post-acceptance experience to protect the newly elevated reference point.",
      "solution": "The acceptance moment is designed as a two-phase emotional experience: (1) The Certainty Moment: when the host accepts, the guest's Leases page transforms. The proposal card morphs into a 'Your Lease' card with a warm purple gradient background and large, clear text: 'Your space in Cambridge is confirmed.' Below: a photo of the space, the agreed dates, and the monthly cost. A brief, restrained celebratory animation plays: a subtle expansion of the card (scale 1.0 to 1.02 to 1.0, 500ms) with a purple border glow. This is elation, not confetti -- the guest has solved a months-long housing problem, and the platform respects the weight of that moment. (2) The Certainty Protection: immediately below the celebration card, the Certainty Timeline (looks-003) renders with the first two steps already completed (Proposal Accepted, Documents Generating). The timeline converts the post-acceptance period from uncertain to structured. The guest sees the path from 'confirmed' to 'moved in' as a series of concrete steps, each of which will be marked complete. This protects the endowment: the guest's new reference point (I have a space) is supported by visible progress toward the physical reality of that space.",

Kahneman's Prospect Theory frames this as a high-stakes gamble: the guest risks loss of time and emotional investment (they have mentally configured 'their' stay), potential financial loss (will I be charged?), and the uncertainty of whether a stranger will be reasonable. Steve's analytical nature adds a layer: he will have carefully calibrated his proposal terms, and rejection implies his judgment was wrong. The emotional challenge is that the proposal moment concentrates all the journey's anxieties into a single click.",
      "solution": "Defuse proposal vulnerability through three emotional scaffolds positioned around the Submit button: (1) Pre-Submit Certainty Strip: directly above the Submit button, a single line in a calm, neutral tone: 'No charge until the host accepts. If the host declines, nothing happens.' This eliminates the financial risk signal. (2) Social Proof Normalization: below the certainty strip, a subtle line: 'Proposals are accepted within 12 hours on average.' This normalizes the waiting period and sets a realistic expectation. It does NOT say 'X guests have proposed for this space' (which creates competition anxiety) -- it says how long the process takes, converting time-uncertainty into time-certainty. (3) Post-Click Reassurance: the Certainty Cascade from behaves-003 fires immediately, delivering a structured sequence of certainty signals. The emotional arc of proposal submission is: vulnerability (pre-click) -> protection (certainty strip) -> normalization (social proof) -> commitment (click) -> reassurance (cascade).

The platform needs a continuous emotional maintenance system that keeps the guest in the gains domain. Without it, the natural decay of positive emotion (hedonic adaptation) combined with the amplified weight of negative events will erode satisfaction even when the objective experience is good.",
      "solution": "Design the active lease emotional experience around a Satisfaction Protection framework with three components: (1) The Savings Pulse: every time the guest visits the Leases page, the first thing they see is their running savings total, updated with a brief counting animation. This creates a recurring positive emotional micro-moment that acts as a buffer against negative events. The savings number is the guest's emotional anchor: as long as it is growing, the overall assessment stays positive. (2) The Proactive Shield: if a potential negative event is detected (payment upcoming, host response time degrading, date-change conflict), the platform surfaces it to the guest BEFORE they encounter it themselves. The emotional difference is enormous: discovering a problem feels like a betrayal (the platform failed me), while being proactively informed feels like protection (the platform is looking out for me). (3) The Renewal Bridge: as the lease end approaches, frame non-renewal as loss rather than decision. 'Your space in Cambridge ends April 30. Renewing preserves your rate, your setup, and your $1,440 in savings.' The endowment effect makes this framing honest: the guest will genuinely lose something they value. The emotional design simply makes this loss visible before it happens, giving the guest time to prevent it.",
