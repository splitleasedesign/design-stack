      "reason": "The visual design uses Inter and DM Sans typefaces extensively, which conflict with tokens.json (Instrument Serif, Outfit, IBM Plex Mono). L3 elements followed the production style guide rather than the token file. This inconsistency must be resolved before implementation.",
      "new_input": "Determine which typography system is authoritative: tokens.json or the production Style-guide.md. If production has moved to Inter/DM Sans, update tokens.json. If tokens.json is the source of truth, redesign L3 elements using Instrument Serif (for anchor headlines), Outfit (for body/action text), and IBM Plex Mono (for verification data). The typographic trust triad from looks-002 (Serif for recognition, Sans for action, Mono for verification) provides the mapping framework."

      "reason": "The vulnerability activation element (feels-0904-001) prescribes a specific emotional sequence (calm recognition -> gentle discomfort -> relief) with a 20-second maximum tension-to-relief arc. This timing constraint has not been validated against real host responses. Some hosts may need longer to process the risk question; others may feel manipulated by the deliberate discomfort.",
      "new_input": "Test the tension-to-relief arc in live discovery calls before implementing it digitally. Have agents ask the problem-framing question ('What happens if a tenant stops paying?') and measure: (1) time from question to host response, (2) nature of response (acknowledgment, deflection, counter-question, rejection), (3) whether hosts who acknowledge the risk are more receptive to the category reveal. The 20-second constraint should be validated or adjusted based on these measurements."
