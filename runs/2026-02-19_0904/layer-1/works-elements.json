Kelly never heard a problem she recognized as unsolved. Play Bigger's core thesis is 'winning companies today market the problem, not just the solution.' Without a problem-first sequence, the host's System 1 categorizes the outreach as 'another middleman pitch' and rejects it before evaluation can begin. Kelly's rejection at 02:09 ('I'd prefer to just kind of work with individuals directly') is a category rejection, not a product rejection -- she dismissed the entire intermediation model because no new problem was surfaced that her current approach fails to solve.",
      "solution": "Restructure the discovery outreach to lead with the problem, not the guest. Before mentioning any specific guest or match, the agent should surface the host's unresolved risks: (1) Open with a problem-framing question that activates the host's own experience of direct-hosting pain: 'Have you ever had a guest who stopped paying midway through, or who you couldn't verify before they moved in?' This forces the host to recall their own negative experiences, which Play Bigger calls 'making them aware they have a problem.' (2) Only after the host acknowledges a problem (or the agent plants the seed of one), introduce the category: 'We created a different kind of hosting -- where you get guaranteed payment regardless of what the guest does, and we verify every guest before they see your listing.' This is category framing, not product pitching. (3) Only then introduce the specific guest as proof that the category works: 'For example, Landon is a verified guest looking for Monday-to-Friday in your area -- and your income is guaranteed whether he stays or not.' The sequence is: problem, then category, then proof. Never proof first.",

Play Bigger's Anchoring Effect research shows that 'the first offer put on the table in a negotiation has a powerful impact on any other offer that comes after.' Kelly's first experience of tenant-finding was direct and personal -- that is her anchor. Every subsequent offering, including Split Lease, is judged against it. Bryant's pitch registered as a competitor within Kelly's existing category ('find tenants online'), not as a new category. The anchor cannot be loosened by being 'better at finding tenants' -- it can only be displaced by being 'different from finding tenants.'

Validating the host's current approach earns trust and avoids triggering defensive bias. (2) Surface the risk that the old category cannot address: 'But if that tenant stops paying in month two, or damages the property, you absorb that cost directly. There is no recourse.' This plants an anchor for a problem the host has either experienced or can imagine. (3) Name the new category: 'We created guaranteed-income hosting. You get paid whether the guest stays or not, and if anything goes wrong, we handle it.' This is not a feature list -- it is a category definition that reframes the problem.

The agent is not a matchmaker; the agent is a 'hosting protection specialist' or simply 'your account manager.' (2) Replace 'guest and host' framing with outcome framing in discovery: instead of 'I'm working with a guest who needs a room,' say 'I can guarantee your rental income for the next three months -- here is how.' The guest is a detail within the guarantee, not the lead. (3) On the platform, avoid any term that maps to Airbnb or Furnished Finder vocabulary. If those platforms use 'listing,' consider 'guaranteed property.' If they use 'booking,' consider 'protected lease.' The vocabulary must signal a different category.

Split Lease's intermediated model removes this control. Bryant acts as the vetting proxy, but Kelly does not trust a proxy because she trusts her own judgment. This is a category mismatch at the deepest level: Kelly's category is 'I control who enters my home.' Split Lease's current category presentation is 'We control who enters your home on your behalf.'

This is not a summary badge -- it is an evidence trail. (2) Let the host set vetting criteria before seeing any guests: 'What matters most to you? Employment verification, background check, references, payment history?' Kelly would have selected all of these. Showing her that the platform checks them systematically -- more thoroughly than she could via a nursing site -- reframes the platform as an upgrade to her vetting, not a replacement of it. (3) Include the raw signals, not just pass/fail. 'Employment: Travel nurse at [Hospital], confirmed via employer verification on [date].' Kelly wanted 'more information as far as their nursing.' Give her exactly that, but sourced through a verified channel she could not access on her own. (4) Allow the host to reject any guest without penalty or justification.

      "problem": "When a host declines during discovery, the current process has no structured recovery path. Bryant responded to Kelly's rejection with 'Okay' (03:02) and then continued pitching the same frame (Landon's flexibility, duration, start date). This is the equivalent of what Play Bigger calls selling 'a me-too position in an existing category' -- doubling down on the same approach after it has already failed. The call ended with a vague future-referral promise from Kelly, but no mechanism exists to convert that latent openness into re-engagement. Play Bigger's 6-10 law suggests that categories take 6-10 years to fully establish. Kelly may be a pre-category host who will adopt once the category is established, but only if the re-engagement process is designed to build category awareness over time rather than repeating the same solution pitch.",
      "solution": "Design a structured category recovery sequence for hosts who decline at discovery. (1) Immediately after rejection, do not continue the pitch. Instead, validate the host's choice and plant a category seed: 'That makes complete sense. You clearly know what works for you. One thing I will mention is that we guarantee income even if a tenant stops paying or leaves early -- that is different from what any site can offer. If that ever matters to you, I am here.' This plants the new category without pressuring adoption. (2) Shift the conversation to the referral channel the host naturally offered. Kelly said she has associates with properties. Ask: 'Is there anyone in your network who might want guaranteed income on their property? I would love to help them.' This turns the rejected host into a referral source, which maintains the relationship without requiring her conversion. (3) After the call, enter the host into a drip sequence that builds category awareness over time -- not product features, but problem stories: 'A host in [nearby city] had a tenant stop paying in month two. Here is how guaranteed-income hosting protected them.' One story per month, tied to local relevance. (4) Set a calendar-based re-engagement at 3 and 6 months, triggered by local adoption milestones when possible.",
