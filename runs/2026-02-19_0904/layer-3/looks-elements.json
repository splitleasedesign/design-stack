      "problem": "L2's Problem-First Information Hierarchy (ds-ui-0904-007) establishes three content tiers -- Problem, Category, Proof -- but the visual design must enforce the hierarchy so the host's eye physically cannot skip to the guest match without first absorbing the risk question. In L2's HTML sketch, all three tiers use similar font sizes (1.125rem, 1rem, 1rem) and similar padding (1.5rem). The visual weight difference is carried only by left-border color, which is insufficient to enforce the cognitive sequence Play Bigger requires. Kelly's rejection happened because Bryant's pitch was solution-first -- the visual equivalent of the Proof tier being the biggest, boldest element on screen. The Problem tier must be visually inescapable: it must be the first thing the eye hits, it must carry the heaviest visual weight, and it must create a visual pause (white space below) before the Category tier begins. The style guide's purple palette (#31135D) is currently associated with brand/CTA elements. Using it for the Problem tier would misassign the brand's authority to a question rather than a statement. Instead, the Problem tier should use warm amber tones (from --signal-warn territory) to signal 'this is something you need to consider' while the Category tier uses the authoritative purple to signal 'this is the answer.' This color-coded hierarchy ensures the eye reads: concern (amber), then authority (purple), then evidence (neutral gray).",
      "solution": "Redesign the three-tier discovery outreach component with a visual weight system that enforces the problem-first sequence through size, color, spacing, and contrast differentials. (1) Problem Tier: headline in Inter, --text-xl (20px), --font-weight-bold (700), color #8B4513 (warm brown -- reads as serious without alarm). Container background: a warm off-white (#FFF8F0) with left border 4px solid #C4841D (amber). Padding: --spacing-2xl (24px) inside, --spacing-3xl (28px) below the tier to create a visual pause. The problem prompt text uses DM Sans, --text-lg (18px), --font-weight-medium (500), color --text-dark (#1a1a1a), line-height --line-height-relaxed (1.6). This is the largest body text on the entire component -- it must feel like a direct, personal question. (2) Category Tier: headline in Inter, --text-lg (18px), --font-weight-bold (700), color --primary-purple (#31135D). Container background: --bg-off-white (rgb(252, 250, 255)) with left border 4px solid --primary-purple (#31135D). Padding: --spacing-2xl (24px) inside, --spacing-xl (20px) below. The statement text uses DM Sans, --text-md (16px), --font-weight-normal (400), color --text-dark. The purple signals brand authority: 'this is what we do.' (3) Proof Tier: headline in Inter, --text-base (14px), --font-weight-semibold (600), color --text-gray (#6b7280). Container background: --bg-light (#f9fafb), no left border accent. Padding: --spacing-lg (16px) inside. Guest details in Inter, --text-sm-md (13px), --font-weight-normal (400).

      "title": "Risk-Contrast Card: Side-by-Side Visual Comparison with Asymmetric Weight",
      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation"],
      "problem": "L2's Risk-Contrast Comparison Card (ds-ui-0904-008) establishes a two-column grid comparing direct hosting risks against guaranteed-income hosting protections. The L2 sketch uses symmetric visual treatment: both columns have equal font sizes, equal padding, and equal cell heights. This symmetry undermines the category-design intent. Play Bigger teaches that the problem must be visually dominant over the solution -- the host needs to see the risk before they see the protection. In the L2 sketch, both column headers use 0.75rem uppercase text, both cell backgrounds are light tints (warm for risk, cool for protection), and the grid treats both sides as equivalent information. But they are not equivalent: the risk column is the category-defining argument; the protection column is the category-defining promise. The risk column must carry more visual weight because Play Bigger's Anchoring Effect requires the problem to land first. Additionally, the L2 sketch's risk column uses soft, warm colors (#FFF8F0, #FFFBF5) that read as 'gentle advisory' rather than 'real exposure.' For hosts like Kelly who are satisfied with direct hosting, the risk must feel concrete -- not alarming, but undeniable. The visual treatment must make the risk feel tangible without making the host feel attacked.",
      "solution": "Redesign the risk-contrast card with asymmetric visual weight that gives the risk column visual dominance while keeping the protection column as the aspirational resolution. (1) Card container: max-width --container-sm (640px), --rounded-xl (12px), --border-color (#e5e7eb) border, --shadow-sm (0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05)). Title bar: Inter, --text-lg (18px), --font-weight-bold (700), #1a1a1a, padding --spacing-xl (20px) --spacing-2xl (24px), background --bg-light (#f9fafb), bottom border --border-color. The title 'What happens when things go wrong?' uses a question format to activate problem recognition. (2) Risk column (column 2 of 3): header 'Direct hosting' in Inter, --text-xs (11px), --font-weight-bold (700), uppercase, letter-spacing 0.06em, color #7C3A00 (dark amber). Background: #FEF0DB (warm amber tint -- stronger than L2's #FFF8F0). Cell backgrounds: #FFF6E8 (slightly stronger warm tint). Cell text: DM Sans, --text-sm-md (13px), --font-weight-medium (500), color #7C3A00. The medium weight and dark amber color give risk cells more visual mass than the protection cells. (3) Protection column (column 3 of 3): header 'Guaranteed-income hosting' in Inter, --text-xs (11px), --font-weight-bold (700), uppercase, letter-spacing 0.06em, color --primary-purple (#31135D). Background: --bg-off-white (rgb(252, 250, 255)). Cell backgrounds: #FAF8FF (very subtle purple tint). Cell text: DM Sans, --text-sm-md (13px), --font-weight-normal (400), color #31135D at 80% opacity. The normal weight (vs. medium for risk) makes protection cells read as resolution, not argument. (4) Dimension labels (column 1): Inter, --text-sm (12px), --font-weight-semibold (600), color --text-dark (#1a1a1a). These anchor each row without competing with either column. (5) Visual weight asymmetry: the risk column uses stronger background tints, heavier font weight, and darker tinted text. The protection column uses softer tints, lighter font weight, and semi-transparent text. The host's eye should read the risk first in each row, then find relief in the protection column. This mirrors Play Bigger's sequence: 'make them aware they have a problem, then offer the solution.'",

The L2 sketch uses a simple table with struck-through old labels and bold purple new labels. While functionally correct, the visual treatment does not create enough cognitive weight to make the vocabulary shift feel important. A table is a reference format -- it organizes information but does not argue for change. Play Bigger's category design requires that the vocabulary shift feel like a paradigm replacement, not a word swap. The visual pattern must make the old vocabulary feel outdated (not just wrong) and the new vocabulary feel inevitable (not just better). Kelly called the call because Bryant used 'matchmaker' -- a word that instantly categorized Split Lease as an intermediary. The vocabulary card must make it viscerally clear that 'matchmaker' is the old category and 'guaranteed-income hosting' is the new one.",
      "solution": "Redesign the vocabulary reference as a card-based format where each vocabulary pair occupies its own visual unit, creating a narrative of replacement rather than a static table. (1) Card container: max-width --container-md (900px), no outer border (cards are the visual units), display as a responsive grid (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile). (2) Individual vocabulary cards: --rounded-xl (12px), --border-color (#e5e7eb) border, white background, --shadow-sm hover transition (0.2s ease). Internal layout: two rows. Top row (old label): Inter, --text-base (14px), --font-weight-normal (400), color --text-light-gray (#9ca3af), text-decoration line-through with --border-gray-lighter (#ddd) as the strikethrough color. The faded color and line-through make the old term feel expired -- not wrong, just past. Bottom row (new label): Inter, --text-md (16px), --font-weight-bold (700), color --primary-purple (#31135D). A left accent bar (3px solid --primary-purple) on the bottom row's container visually connects the new vocabulary to the brand.

Examples: 'AGENT ROLE,' 'SERVICE DESCRIPTION,' 'OUTREACH OPENER.' (4) Visual transition between old and new: a thin divider line (1px solid --border-light (#f3f4f6)) between the old and new rows, with the new row having a background tint of --bg-off-white (rgb(252, 250, 255)).

The L2 sketch uses a compact card format that is functionally sound but visually could be confused with a marketing email or promotional notification. Play Bigger's Groupthink Bias research shows that social proof must feel informational, not promotional -- the signal is 'other people near you are doing this' not 'buy this now.' The L2 sketch's visual treatment uses a light purple background (#FAFAFF) and a thin border (#E8E4F0) that resembles a standard platform notification. For a pre-category host who has already rejected the platform, any visual resemblance to marketing triggers deletion before reading. The notification must look like a data update from a trusted local source, not like a promotional message. The geographic anchor ('In Troy, MI') is small and subordinate in the L2 sketch. For Groupthink Bias to activate, the location must be the most visually prominent element -- because the power of the signal is not 'people are using this' but 'people NEAR YOU are using this.' The proximity is what triggers the brain's error signal.",

Everything else radiates outward from this anchor in decreasing visual weight: (1) Category name (bold, purple, centered -- 1 second). (2) Horizontal rule (visual pause -- 0.5 seconds). (3) Category definition (two lines of dark text -- 2 seconds). (4) Scenario block (gray background, smaller text -- 3 seconds if read). (5) Contact block (lightest text -- noticed, not actively read). The card should be fully scannable in 5 seconds. A host who glances at it for 2 seconds should walk away remembering 'Guaranteed-Income Hosting' in purple. That is the design's success criterion. On mobile: renders as a compact, portrait-oriented card that fits within a single screen without scrolling.",
      "brand_alignment": "The extreme restraint of this card is its brand signal. In a world of noisy marketing emails and promotional notifications, a card with one bold purple headline, two lines of text, and a quiet contact block communicates: 'we respect your time and your decision.' This aligns with the taste model's 'confident, not flashy' and 'premium-accessible' principles. The purple category name carries the entire brand weight -- it does not need a logo or gradient to signal Split Lease. The simplicity is the sophistication."
