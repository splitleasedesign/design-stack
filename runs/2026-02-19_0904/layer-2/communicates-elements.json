    "lens_summary": "Kelly declined because the information architecture of discovery presented solution-data (guest attributes, schedule, flexibility) before problem-data (host exposure to payment risk, vetting burden, no recourse). Play Bigger's category design framework shows that information must be sequenced problem-first to open a new mental category. As Information Architect, the core finding is that every data element Kelly encountered was organized within the wrong category frame -- 'here is a tenant match' instead of 'here is the risk you carry and how we eliminate it.' The information hierarchy, labeling, content sequencing, and data transparency structures below address what should have been architected differently to prevent category-level rejection at discovery."

      "problem": "The information Kelly received was organized in a solution-first hierarchy: guest name, guest schedule, guest flexibility, guest duration, agent role. Every data point answered the question 'Who is this tenant?' -- a question Kelly never asked because she already has her own channels for finding tenants. Play Bigger teaches that 'winning companies today market the problem, not just the solution.' The information architecture of the discovery touchpoint (whether a call script, email template, or landing page) must invert the hierarchy: problem data first (what risks does direct hosting expose you to?), then category data (what is guaranteed-income hosting?), then solution data (here is a verified guest who proves the category works). Kelly heard solution data exclusively ('Landon is looking for Monday to Friday, three months, early February') and never encountered problem data or category data. The information hierarchy itself caused the rejection -- not the quality of the information within it.",
      "solution": "Design a discovery information hierarchy that sequences content in three tiers. Tier 1 (Problem Layer): Surface the host's unresolved exposure. Structure as a question or scenario that activates recognition: 'If a tenant stops paying in month two, what is your recourse?' or 'When you rent directly, who covers damages if the tenant leaves?' This tier contains no mention of Split Lease, no guest details, no platform features. It is pure problem framing. Tier 2 (Category Layer): Name the new category and its core promise. Structure as a single declarative statement: 'We created guaranteed-income hosting -- you get paid whether the guest stays or not, and every guest is verified before they see your property.' This tier introduces Split Lease's category position but still contains no specific guest data. Tier 3 (Proof Layer): Present a specific guest match as evidence that the category works. Structure as concrete details: 'For example, Landon is a verified professional looking for Monday-to-Friday stays starting in February -- and your income is guaranteed from day one.' This tier is where Bryant's original pitch content belongs -- but only after Tiers 1 and 2 have been delivered. Apply this hierarchy to every discovery touchpoint: call scripts, initial emails, SMS outreach, and landing pages. The hierarchy should be visible in the content structure itself -- section headers, paragraph order, and visual weight must reflect problem > category > proof.",

This model feels complete and satisfactory to her. Play Bigger's Anchoring Effect research shows that 'the first offer put on the table in a negotiation has a powerful impact on any other offer that comes after' -- Kelly's anchor is direct hosting, and she judges all alternatives against it. The information architecture never presented a structured comparison that would surface the gaps in her current model. Without a side-by-side risk contrast, Kelly cannot see what her current approach lacks because she has never organized the information that way. She sees 'direct = I have control' but not 'direct = I absorb all risk.' The information architecture must surface both sides simultaneously through a structured comparison format.",
      "solution": "Design a risk-contrast comparison card that places the host's current approach and guaranteed-income hosting side by side, organized around risk dimensions rather than feature dimensions. The card does not compare features (listing reach, matching speed, platform tools) because feature comparison positions Split Lease as a competitor within Kelly's existing category. Instead, it compares risk exposure across dimensions the host cares about: payment security, tenant verification depth, damage protection, and legal recourse. For each dimension, show what the host currently absorbs personally versus what the platform guarantees. The card should be scannable in under 10 seconds -- the host should be able to see the risk gap at a glance. Visual weight should emphasize the risk column (what you carry now) more than the protection column (what we provide), because the goal is to surface the problem, not sell the solution. The card can be used in digital outreach (email, landing page), presented on-screen during a video call, or described verbally using the same structure during a phone call.",

This label -- 'matchmaker' -- immediately categorized Split Lease within Kelly's existing mental model: a two-sided marketplace intermediary, like Furnished Finder or Airbnb. The label triggered instant classification, and once classified, the offering was evaluated within the wrong category and rejected. Play Bigger documents how Jawbone 'three times came up with cool innovations that created a brand-new product category. But three times, Jawbone failed to develop and dominate the category it created.' The failure was not in the product but in the labeling -- Jawbone was perceived as 'just another wireless headset' because its vocabulary mapped to the existing category. Similarly, 'matchmaker,' 'guest,' 'host,' 'listing,' and 'booking' all map to the tenant-finding intermediation category. Every label in the platform vocabulary must be audited and, where necessary, replaced with terms that signal the new category: guaranteed-income hosting.",
      "solution": "Create a category-defining label system that replaces intermediation vocabulary with outcome vocabulary across all touchpoints. The system should include: (1) Role labels: replace 'matchmaker' with 'hosting protection manager' or 'account manager.' Replace 'guest and host' with 'verified occupant and property owner' in discovery contexts (guest/host can be used once the host has adopted the category frame, but not before). (2) Service labels: replace 'matching' with 'guaranteed placement.' Replace 'booking' with 'protected lease.' Replace 'listing' with 'protected property' or 'guaranteed-income property.' (3) Outcome labels: every label should pass the test: 'Does this word make us sound like what Kelly already uses?' If yes, replace it. 'We match you with tenants' becomes 'We guarantee your income.' 'We found a guest for your listing' becomes 'We have a verified placement for your property with guaranteed payment.' (4) Implement the label system as a reference document for all customer-facing content: call scripts, email templates, UI copy, marketing materials. Audit quarterly for vocabulary drift back toward intermediation terms.",

Kelly will be more likely to reconsider when she learns that other hosts in Troy or Metro Detroit are using guaranteed-income hosting. But this local adoption signal must be delivered through a carefully structured notification -- not a sales pitch, not a guest match, not a feature update.

The information architecture of the notification: (1) Geographic anchor: 'In Troy, MI' or 'Near you in Metro Detroit' -- the location comes first because it activates local identity and Groupthink Bias. (2) Social proof signal: '[N] property owners now use guaranteed-income hosting' -- the count is the core data point. No names, no details, just the aggregate signal. (3) Outcome data: 'with $[X] in guaranteed income paid this month' -- the outcome reinforces the category frame. (4) Low-pressure reconnection: 'Bryant is still your hosting protection manager if you ever want to learn more.' -- personal continuity, not a sales CTA.

(3) One risk scenario: 'If a tenant stops paying in month two, guaranteed-income hosting means you still get paid through the full lease term.' This plants a problem seed -- the next time Kelly hears about a non-paying tenant (her own or a friend's), this scenario will trigger recall. (4) Personal reconnection anchor: 'Bryant -- your hosting protection manager in Troy, MI' with phone number. This maintains the personal relationship (which was warm) while reframing Bryant's role from 'matchmaker' to 'hosting protection manager.' No features, no guest matches, no call-to-action buttons. The card is designed to be glanced at once (5 seconds), then remembered later when circumstances change.",
