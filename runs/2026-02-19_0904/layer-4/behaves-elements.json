    "lens_summary": "Kelly's rejection was instantaneous -- Bryant said 'matchmaker between guests and hosts' at 01:14 and Kelly had decided to decline by 02:09, a 55-second window. The interaction patterns here address the behavioral timing, state transitions, and progressive disclosure mechanics that would have slowed that decision, forced problem-processing before solution-evaluation, and created recovery pathways when the host signals rejection. Play Bigger's category design framework maps directly to interaction sequencing: the problem must be cognitively processed before the category is named, and the category must be anchored before any proof is offered. Each interaction pattern below specifies the behavioral states, timing constraints, and transition logic that enforce this cognitive sequence through UI behavior."

      "journey_phases": ["discovery", "evaluation"],
      "problem": "L2's Problem-First Information Hierarchy (ds-ui-0904-007) and L3's visual weight system (looks-0904-001) establish the three-tier structure (Problem > Category > Proof) and ensure the Problem tier is visually dominant. But visual weight alone cannot enforce cognitive processing. A host can scroll past the Problem tier in under one second, eyes landing on the guest match (Proof tier) before the risk question has been absorbed. Kelly's call demonstrates this failure mode: Bryant delivered solution-data (Landon's schedule, flexibility) within 30 seconds of the conversation starting. Kelly's System 1 categorized the pitch as 'another middleman' before any problem could be processed. In a digital context, this is equivalent to the host scrolling past 'What happens if a tenant stops paying?' to reach 'Landon -- verified professional, Mon-Fri, 3 months.' The Problem tier must not only be visually dominant -- it must be behaviorally gating. The Category and Proof tiers should not be interactable until the host has demonstrably engaged with the Problem tier.",
      "solution": "Implement a progressive disclosure gate where the Category and Proof tiers are initially collapsed (visually hinted but not readable) and expand only after the host demonstrates engagement with the Problem tier. The gate mechanism works as follows: (1) On page load, the Problem tier renders fully visible with L3's specified typography and color treatment. The Category and Proof tiers render as blurred, height-collapsed placeholders -- the host can see that more content exists below but cannot read it. This creates curiosity without enabling bypass. (2) The gate opens when one of these engagement signals is detected: the host's viewport has kept the Problem tier in view for 4 seconds (dwell threshold), OR the host clicks/taps the Problem tier's question text, OR the host scrolls past the Problem tier's bottom boundary (indicating they have at least visually traversed it). (3) When the gate opens, the Category tier smoothly expands (height animation 400ms, ease-out) and the blur lifts (filter transition 300ms). The Proof tier remains collapsed until the Category tier has been in viewport for 2 seconds or the host scrolls past it. (4) On mobile, where viewport is narrow, the dwell threshold for the Problem tier increases to 5 seconds because the tier takes longer to read at mobile font sizes. (5) If the host attempts to scroll past the Problem tier before the dwell threshold, a subtle resistance effect applies: the scroll decelerates gently (not a hard stop -- that would feel adversarial) and the Problem tier's question text briefly pulses in opacity (from 1.0 to 0.85 and back, 200ms) to draw the eye back. This resistance fires only once per session to avoid annoyance.",

But a static card invites passive scanning -- the host's eye can glide across all four rows without deeply processing any single risk dimension. Kelly's call shows that she evaluated her hosting approach on a single dimension (trust through direct vetting) and never considered the other dimensions (payment risk, damage liability, early departure). The static card surfaces these dimensions but does not force processing of each one individually. The interaction pattern must create a row-level engagement mechanism that makes each risk dimension feel personal and concrete when the host focuses on it, transforming a passive comparison into an active evaluation.",
      "solution": "Implement row-level hover/focus states that amplify the risk column and simultaneously suppress the other rows, creating a single-dimension spotlight effect. The interaction sequence: (1) On hover (desktop) or tap (mobile) of any row, that row expands vertically by 8px (padding increase, 200ms ease-out) while other rows contract by 2px and reduce opacity to 0.5 (200ms ease-out). The hovered row's risk cell intensifies: background shifts from #FFF6E8 to #FEE8C8 (a deeper amber), text weight shifts from 500 to 600, and a subtle left border accent (3px solid #C4841D) appears on the risk cell only. (2) The protection cell in the same row simultaneously reveals a micro-detail that was hidden by default: a single qualifying sentence that makes the protection concrete. For example, the 'If tenant stops paying' row's protection cell expands to show 'You get paid regardless' plus a revealed line: 'Guaranteed through the full lease term, deposited monthly.' This progressive detail prevents information overload in the default state while rewarding engagement. (3) On hover-out or tap-away, the row contracts back to default dimensions (200ms ease-out), the micro-detail collapses (150ms), and all rows restore full opacity. (4) On mobile, where hover is unavailable, each row has a tap-to-expand behavior: tapping a row opens it (micro-detail revealed, row expanded) and closes any previously open row. Only one row can be expanded at a time to preserve the single-dimension spotlight effect.",

But the interaction behavior of the expansion is unspecified: How does the host discover that cards are expandable? What happens when multiple cards are expanded? How does the expansion reinforce -- rather than undermine -- the host's sense of control? Kelly's core objection was about information access and personal judgment ('I wanted someone who I can get a little bit more information'). The expansion behavior must feel like the host is pulling information toward themselves (active discovery), not like the platform is pushing information at them (passive receipt). If the detail section auto-expands or reveals without the host's explicit action, it violates the control principle that makes this component effective for control-oriented hosts like Kelly.",
      "solution": "Implement a strictly host-initiated expansion pattern where each card's detail section opens only on explicit click/tap, with no auto-expansion, no hover-triggered reveals, and no time-based progressive disclosure. The interaction sequence: (1) Default state: all four cards show summary-level information (one line each). The 'View verification details' trigger text is styled as an interactive element (L3 purple color, cursor pointer, underline on hover) but does not animate or pulse to attract attention -- the host discovers it naturally. (2) On click/tap of the trigger, the detail section expands downward with a smooth height transition (300ms ease-out). The trigger text changes from 'View verification details' to 'Hide details' with a 150ms crossfade. A subtle rotation animation on an inline chevron icon (0deg to 180deg, 200ms) provides spatial feedback. (3) Multiple cards can be expanded simultaneously -- there is no accordion behavior that collapses one when another opens. Control-oriented hosts may want to compare verification details across dimensions, and collapsing one to see another would feel like the platform is limiting their access. (4) The primary cards (Employment, Identity) show a subtle affordance hint on first page load: the trigger text briefly underlines with a 1px dashed line (opacity 0 to 0.5 to 0, 1500ms) that fires once per session. This is the only proactive signal; everything else waits for the host. (5) When a card is expanded, a thin left accent border (3px solid, matching the card's accent color) extends from the summary section into the detail section, visually connecting them as one unit. The border appears with a height animation (200ms ease-out, 100ms delay after content expansion starts).",

Play Bigger's Anchoring Effect research suggests anchors are set rapidly but can be displaced by a strong counter-anchor within a short window. The delivery mechanism must also match the host's preferred communication channel -- Kelly exchanged phone numbers with Bryant, suggesting SMS is more natural than email for their relationship.",
      "solution": "Implement a timed delivery sequence with channel selection logic. The sequence: (1) T+0 (call ends): Agent marks the call as 'declined' in the CRM with one tap. The system queues the seed card for delivery. No immediate action -- the host should not receive anything in the first 20 minutes, which is the 'rejection processing' window where any outreach feels adversarial. (2) T+25 minutes: The system sends the seed card via SMS as a brief text message with a link to the visual card. The SMS text reads: 'Hi Kelly, this is Bryant from SplitLease. Thanks for chatting today. Here is a quick overview of guaranteed-income hosting if it ever becomes relevant: [link].' The tone is warm, informational, non-promotional. The link opens the visual seed card (L2/L3 design) as a standalone mobile-optimized page -- not the platform homepage, not a signup flow, just the card. (3) T+48 hours: If the SMS link was not tapped (tracked via link analytics), the system sends an email with the seed card embedded directly in the email body (not as a link). The email subject line is 'Guaranteed-Income Hosting -- for reference' and contains the card's content rendered as email-safe HTML. No CTA button, no platform links beyond the card content. (4) No further automated touchpoints for 30 days. The next touchpoint is the local social proof notification (L2 ds-ui-0904-011), triggered by geographic adoption milestones, not by a timer. (5) If the SMS link was tapped, the email at T+48h is suppressed -- the host has already seen the card and a duplicate would feel like tracking-driven marketing.",

But the behavioral question is: what triggers the notification, how does the host interact with it, and what happens after it is delivered? A social proof notification sent on a fixed schedule (monthly, quarterly) would feel like marketing. A notification triggered by a genuine local milestone (a new host joined in Troy, MI) feels like a data update. The distinction is in the trigger logic: timer-based triggers are promotional; event-based triggers are informational. Play Bigger's Groupthink Bias requires real group behavior to be effective -- fabricated or scheduled 'updates' that don't correspond to actual events will be detected as marketing and dismissed. The interaction pattern must ensure that every notification corresponds to a real adoption event in the host's micro-market.",
      "solution": "Implement an event-driven notification system where each notification is triggered by a real geographic adoption milestone, not by a timer. The system operates as follows: (1) Geographic micro-market definition: each pre-category host is assigned to a micro-market based on their zip code or city. Kelly's micro-market is Troy, MI (or Metro Detroit if Troy alone is too small). The micro-market radius is 10 miles from the host's address. (2) Milestone events that trigger notifications: first host joins within the micro-market (milestone 1), third host joins (milestone 2), first lease completes successfully (milestone 3), first host review posted (milestone 4). Each milestone fires at most one notification per pre-category host. (3) Notification delivery: SMS is the primary channel (matching the personal relationship from the seed card sequence). The SMS contains the L2/L3 notification content as a brief message with a link to the visual card: 'Update from Troy, MI: 3 property owners now use guaranteed-income hosting. $12,400 in guaranteed income paid this month. Bryant is still here if you want to learn more: [link].' The link opens a standalone mobile page with the full L3 notification card. (4) Frequency cap: maximum one notification per calendar month, regardless of how many milestones occur. If multiple milestones fire within a month, only the highest-value one is sent (milestone 4 > 3 > 2 > 1). (5) Engagement detection: if the host taps the SMS link, this is recorded as a re-engagement signal. The agent receives an alert: 'Kelly viewed the Troy social proof update.' The agent can then decide whether to initiate a personal follow-up. The system does not auto-trigger any further outreach -- the agent controls the re-engagement conversation. (6) Opt-out: every notification includes a reply-based opt-out ('Reply STOP to unsubscribe'). If the host opts out, all automated notifications cease permanently for that host. Manual agent outreach remains possible but is the agent's decision.",

A reference card on his desk would not have prevented this -- it requires active recall during a flowing conversation.

The panel is always visible but visually quiet: a single column showing the six most critical vocabulary pairs from L2's label system, with the new (category-defining) terms displayed in bold purple and the old terms in faded strike-through. (2) Before the call begins (during the pre-call preparation screen), the panel briefly highlights the three most important vocabulary swaps for the call context. For a discovery call to a new host: 'Remember: guaranteed income, not matching. Hosting protection manager, not matchmaker. Verified occupant, not guest.' This displays for 5 seconds, then fades to the persistent quiet panel. (3) The panel includes a 'Category Opener' section at the top that shows the recommended problem-first opening question for this host type. For Kelly's profile (direct-work preference, nursing sites): 'Have you ever had a tenant stop paying or leave early? What happened?' This is not a script -- it is a prompt that the agent adapts to their conversational style. (4) If the CRM has speech-to-text capability during the call, the system can detect when the agent uses an old-category term (e.g., 'matchmaker,' 'booking,' 'listing') and briefly flash the corresponding new term in the panel. The flash is a gentle pulse (opacity 0.7 to 1.0 to 0.7, 800ms) on the relevant vocabulary pair -- not an intrusive alert. The agent notices it peripherally and self-corrects in the next sentence. (5) Post-call, the system generates a brief vocabulary report: 'Category language used: 4/6 recommended terms. Old terms used: matchmaker (1x), listing (2x).'
