# SplitLease Taste Model

## Brand Essence
SplitLease is a housing marketplace for people who need flexible, medium-term stays. Not a hotel. Not a permanent lease. The sweet spot in between.

## Visual Personality
- Warm, not cold. Soft backgrounds, not stark white.
- Confident, not flashy. The product speaks through clarity, not decoration.
- Trustworthy, not corporate. Rounded corners, human language, real data.
- Premium-accessible. Feels high quality without feeling exclusive.

## Typography Philosophy
- Serif for personality (headlines, brand). Instrument Serif — elegant but approachable.
- Sans for clarity (body, UI). Outfit — geometric but warm.
- Mono for data/trust (prices, stats, badges). IBM Plex Mono — signals precision and reliability.

## Color Philosophy
- Warm neutrals as base (not gray, not white — warm off-whites and tans)
- Forest green as accent (trust, growth, stability — not startup blue)
- Amber for warnings/urgency (warm, not alarming)
- Red only for errors (never for CTAs or emphasis)

## Animation Philosophy
- Fast response, gentle settle. User actions feel instant (< 100ms acknowledgment) but transitions are smooth (300-500ms).
- Never bounce. Spring easing for interactive elements, ease-out for transitions.
- One signature animation per component — restraint over spectacle.

## Core Value: Relentless Personalization
The UI should adapt to who you are and where you are in your journey. Generic states are a failure. If we know something about the user, the UI should reflect it.
