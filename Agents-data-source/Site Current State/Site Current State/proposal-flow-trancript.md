00:40 what are the actions that you have to do. It's going to be very simple. I'm going to provide, uhm, the accesses to the, uhm, to the site.

00:55 So, first of all, you have to create a listing. Uh, probably you already know that, but I will do it again.

01:07 So, yeah, the first you click on signing, you are going to copy the email that I'm going to provide and the password or host that I will provide later.

01:30 And you are going to log in. Be careful with the space, extra space, when you paste. Uh, remove the extra space, in this case, if you cause any error but it happens to me so be attentive to that.

02:40 If by any chance you have a problem with the account or with the email, you can create a new one.

02:54 And to create a new account, you click on, you close the model, you click on sign up, you click share MySpace.

03:03 We are going to provide the name and the email and the birthday, we are going to continue and create a new account.

03:20 But probably it's not going to be necessary. Here on the, after login, here on the header, there is a dropdown, an option for host with us.

03:34 You click on it and you're going to click on create listing. It's on the left side banner. There, the dropdown shows an image and the bottom, there's create listing button.

03:54 Okay, here we are, listing setup. The page URL itself, listing setup. Listing v2, so that's the page that you should be in.

04:04 Uh, you can select whatever option, who are you, you select, I own or rent a property, but do not leave there or whatever option here.

04:17 Market strategy, you can choose whatever option to. And here on the listing strategy, use this and select. random days, you can select different days.

04:34 If you select very few days, it's going to show select at least few nights, so, I have selected at least few nights, so, try to select different days every run.

04:49 Uh, yeah, and have to be contiguous. And select nightly. You can play with that actually, here on the listing strategy, this tab 3, sometimes use weekly, sometimes use monthly, but most of the times use the nightly okay most of the time try to create a mathematical that create this randomness Okay, here

05:24 on step 4, pricing strategy, select a price, uhm, baseline rate, try to search for, for, New York City places, what are the prices per night in general, try to have, like, an empty file with that information, that can help and the backline rate.

05:56 Long stay discounts. It's a thing that I recommend that you click and hover, you can play with that. Damage deposit, you can change that for a little bit, for 1,000, whatever, cleaning fee you can change it, or, or, leave the way, the way it is.

06:21 Continue, uh, the type and space, the space and time, this is step 5. Select whatever option, address, select a New York City address.

06:37 One thing that I do is to just add the first four numbers, like 14, 56, and it will show a couple of addresses.

06:53 Okay, photos, you can skip that, but you can also have, like, three pictures that is just for test. And you click on continue, or skip.

07:09 and here you can click to active the listing. Okay, this was the first step. You can click on Go to My Dashboard.

07:27 And here on Go to My Dashboard, you are going to click on Copy Listing Link. You can save it, uh, whatever you want to save.

07:41 You can open a new tab open keep and paste the and paste the or you can just save in our memories or just save on a file during the process.

08:02 Copy the link. Uh, and after you copy the link of the listing, you click on sign out. When you sign out, you log in again with a different account, but this time a guest account.

08:28 Then I'm going to provide the alt later. And here the same, be careful, there's extra spaces on email and on password.

08:40 And what you're going to do after you log in, you're going to paste the URL of the, that you just copied from the host listing.

09:04 And you are going to create a proposal. Again, you can play around with the weekly schedule selector, uhm, but be careful that if you like too many, like too few options it's going to show you a minimum of two nights, three days required.

09:24 Uh, okay, yeah, you can try different options. You can try different reservation spans. 17, 22, try to make it random.

09:37 And, click, sometimes, I think it's a bug we are having now, you have to scroll down a lot to see the Create Proposal button.

09:53 So be attentive to that. If it's not showing to you the Create Proposal button, scroll a little bit more and you're going to find it.

10:00 Okay, it's going to show you a pop-up to confirm proposal. Just click on Submit Proposal. Go to the Guest Dashboard.

10:23 Okay, so you're going to see the Guest Dashboard. and you are going to going to do it again you're gonna going to log out sign out by clicking on the on the profile picture of the host that is shown on the header and you are going to sign out you're going to take again the host's email address and going

10:59 to sign in again with the new, with the host account. After you log in, click again on the, on the picture of the host in the header.

12:40 In this case, just submit. Again, you have to click on the profile picture in the header and sign out. And you're going to take the gas link.

13:06 Click on sign in, login, and you already know the process, You're going to click on the header menu that shows the profile picture.
