## The Data Speaks: What We Actually Found

### Finding 1: The "Ghost Roommate" Model Has a 5-Host Market

**The Data:**
- Total hosts who accept ghost roommates AND are likely to convert: **5 hosts**
  - Owner-Occupants (3): Jonathan Kim, Sherene, Zein
  - Investors (2): David, Jessica Filomeno

**New Assumption:**
> The ghost roommate model is not a mass-market product. It appeals to approximately **10.9% of hosts** (5/46). This is not a scaling problem to solve - it's a market size reality to accept.

**Implication:** Stop trying to convince the 89% who don't want it. Build for the 11% who do.

---

### Finding 2: Owner-Occupants Want a Roommate, Not a Business

**The Data:**
- Owner-occupants who prefer single guest: **11 hosts (34.4%)**
  > Chantel, Dana, Deedra, Gale Grant, Hemeden, Joie Coelho, Joie & James, Kris, Patricia (1&2), Scott White, Stephanie

- Owner-occupants who prefer long-term: **11 hosts (34.4%)**
  > Chantel, Dana, Deedra, Drew, Kris, Lilly, Luci Chambers, Scott White, Stephanie, Toni

- Owner-occupants likely to convert: **21 hosts (65.6%)**

**New Assumption:**
> Owner-occupants are not looking for "rental income optimization." They want a **compatible person to share space with** while they're away. The product they want is "find me ONE good roommate for a few months" - not "maximize my income with rotating guests."

**Implication:** The value proposition for owner-occupants should be **relationship quality**, not revenue.

---

### Finding 3: Investors Want Hands-Off Income, Not Flexibility

**The Data:**
- Investor hosts with payment concerns: **6 hosts (60%)**
  > Andreas, Diane Kaufhold, John, June, Ramsey, Tammy

- Investor hosts who accept ghost roommates: **6 hosts (60%)**
  > Andreas, David, Diane Kaufhold, Jessica Filomeno, June, Ramsey, Tammy

- Investor hosts likely to convert: **3 hosts (30%)**
  > David, Jessica Filomeno, Rami

**New Assumption:**
> Investors accept the ghost roommate model because they don't live there - they have no "mental burden" of sharing space. But they have HIGH friction around payment reliability. The 60% conditional/decline rate is about **financial trust, not product fit**.

**Implication:** Investor hosts need **guaranteed payment** and **property protection**, not flexibility features.

---

### Finding 4: Platform Resistance is Binary and Fatal

**The Data:**
- Hosts with platform resistance who declined: **4 hosts (100%)**
  > Gregory Stanford, Kelly, Malvern, Paul

- Hosts without platform resistance who declined: **3 hosts (7.1%)**

**New Assumption:**
> Platform resistance is not a feature objection - it's a **worldview**. These hosts fundamentally reject intermediation. No feature, price, or pitch will convert them.

**Implication:** Qualify out platform-resistant hosts immediately. Don't invest sales effort.

---

### Finding 5: The "Ideal Host" Doesn't Want the "Ideal Product"

**The Data:**
- Part-time occupants (ideal hosts) identified: **7 hosts**
  > Jonathan Kim, Kris, Deedra, Dana, Zein, Scott White, Gale Grant

- Part-time occupants likely to convert: **6 hosts (85.7%)**

- Part-time occupants who accept ghost roommates: **2 hosts (28.6%)**
  > Jonathan Kim, Zein

- Part-time occupants who reject/prefer single: **5 hosts (71.4%)**
  > Kris, Deedra, Dana, Scott White, Gale Grant

**New Assumption:**
> The hosts with the "ideal" travel pattern for Split Lease are NOT ideal customers for the ghost roommate model. They convert easily because they need the service - but they want **one reliable person**, not rotating strangers.

**Implication:** The product-market fit exists for **long-term single placement**, not split-week rotation.

---

### Finding 6: Money Doesn't Solve Mental Burden

**The Data:**
- Hosts who reject ghost roommates where price could change mind: **1 host (16.7%)**
  > Sherene

- Hosts who reject ghost roommates with non-negotiable objections: **5 hosts (83.3%)**
  > Dana, Gale Grant, Hemeden, Joie & James, Patricia (1&2)

**New Assumption:**
> The objection to ghost roommates is not economic - it's **psychological**. These hosts are not saying "not worth the money." They're saying "I don't want strangers rotating through my home regardless of price."

**Implication:** Higher prices won't expand the market. The ceiling is set by psychology, not economics.

---

### Finding 7: Trust Concerns Are About Vetting, Not Platform

**The Data:**
- Owner-occupants with trust concerns: **8 hosts (25%)**
  > Chantel, Dana, Dimitri, Hemeden, Kent, Lilly, Louise, Patricia (1&2), Sherene

- These hosts' conversion outcomes:
  - Likely: Chantel, Dimitri, Lilly
  - Conditional: Dana, Hemeden, Kent, Louise, Sherene
  - Declined: Patricia (1&2)

**New Assumption:**
> Trust concerns correlate with "Conditional" outcomes, not declines. Hosts with trust concerns are **willing to proceed IF vetting is demonstrated**. This is solvable.

**Implication:** Better vetting communication converts "Conditional" to "Likely."

---

### Finding 8: Co-op Restrictions Are a Hard Wall

**The Data:**
- Hosts with co-op restrictions: **2 hosts**
  > Gregory Stanford, Patricia (1&2)

- Both declined.

**New Assumption:**
> Co-op restrictions are not negotiable. These hosts cannot legally participate regardless of desire.

**Implication:** Qualify out co-op residents immediately. No sales effort.

---

## New Strategic Framework

### The Three Host Segments (Data-Defined)

| Segment | Size | Accepts Ghost | Converts | Needs |
|---------|------|---------------|----------|-------|
| **Relationship Seekers** | 34% (11 hosts) | No | High (65%+) | One compatible roommate, long-term |
| **Income Optimizers** | 22% (10 hosts) | Yes (60%) | Low (30%) | Payment guarantee, hands-off |
| **Flexibility Seekers** | 11% (5 hosts) | Yes | High | The current product |

**Relationship Seekers (11 hosts):**
> Chantel, Dana, Deedra, Gale Grant, Hemeden, Joie Coelho, Joie & James, Kris, Patricia (1&2), Scott White, Stephanie

**Income Optimizers (10 hosts - all investors):**
> Andreas, David, Diane Kaufhold, Jessica Filomeno, John, June, Malvern, Paul, Rami, Ramsey, Tammy

**Flexibility Seekers (5 hosts - accept ghost + likely):**
> Jonathan Kim, Sherene, Zein, David, Jessica Filomeno

## The Core Insight

### What We Thought vs. What The Data Shows

| Original Belief | Data Reality |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Ghost roommates appeal to part-time hosts | Only 28.6% of part-time hosts accept |
| Higher prices can expand the market | Only 16.7% show price flexibility |
| Owner-occupants are income-motivated | 34.4% explicitly prioritize single guest over income |
| Investors are hard to work with | Investors accept ghost model 60% vs 12.5% owner-occupants |
| Platform resistance can be overcome | 100% decline rate - it cannot |
| The product is right, we need more hosts | The hosts exist, the product doesn't match what they want |

## The 5 Hosts Who Want What We Built

If Split Lease continues with the ghost roommate model as primary product, the total addressable market from this sample is:

**Jonathan Kim** - Owner-occupant, 50% travel, accepts ghost, likely
**Sherene** - Owner-occupant, accepts ghost, conditional (price sensitive)
**Zein** - Owner-occupant, Boston Mon-Thu, accepts ghost, likely
**David** - Investor, accepts ghost, likely
**Jessica Filomeno** - Investor/broker, accepts ghost, likely

**That's it. Five hosts out of 46.**

---

## The 21 Hosts Who Want What We Could Build

If Split Lease pivots to single-guest long-term placement:

**High-Confidence Targets (21 owner-occupants, likely conversion):**
> Chantel, Anthony, Cristina, Deedra, Dimitri, Drew, Gale Grant, Joie Coelho, Jonathan Kim, Keah, Kris, Lilly, Nakoley Renville, Robbie, Scott White, Shirley, Stephanie, Toni, Zein

**Conversion Rate:** 65.6%
**Market Size:** 4.2x larger than ghost roommate model

---

## Conclusion: Follow the Data

The data does not support the ghost roommate model as a mass-market product.

The data DOES support:
1. Single-guest, long-term placement for owner-occupants (21 hosts, 65.6% conversion)
2. Ghost roommates as premium niche (5 hosts, 10.9% of market)
3. Investor partnerships with payment guarantees (7 hosts accept ghost, need payment trust)

**The question is not "how do we convince more hosts to accept ghost roommates?"**

**The question is "do we build what 5 hosts want, or what 21 hosts want?"**
