# Split Lease Host Analysis: Strategic Reframe

**Date:** 2025-11-27
**Sample Size:** N = 46 host call transcripts
**Purpose:** Fresh strategic interpretation of quantitative findings

---

## Executive Summary

The data reveals a fundamental **market-product misalignment**. Split Lease has been pursuing a ghost roommate model while the actual convertible market wants something different. This analysis reframes the findings to identify what product the market is actually demanding.

---

## The Core Discovery

### What We Thought We Were Building
A platform where hosts accept multiple rotating guests ("ghost roommates") sharing their space on alternating schedules.

### What The Market Is Actually Buying
A **trusted matchmaking service** for hosts seeking a **single, long-term, reliable tenant** who happens to need part-time occupancy.

---

## Three Distinct Market Segments (Reframed)

### Segment 1: "The Relationship Seeker" (65% of convertible hosts)

**Profile:** Owner-occupants who want ONE person they can trust
**Size:** 21 of 32 owner-occupants likely to convert

**Representative Hosts:**
- Chantel, Deedra, Kris, Scott White, Stephanie - explicitly prefer single guest + long-term
- Joie Coelho, Gale Grant - prefer single guest for comfort reasons
- Drew, Lilly, Toni - prefer long-term commitment

**What They're Actually Saying:**
> "I want a roommate I can trust, who pays reliably, and doesn't disrupt my life."

**Ghost Roommates?** Not interested (only 12.5% accept, 18.8% explicitly reject)

**Conversion Rate:** 65.6% likely

**Key Insight:** These hosts aren't selling spare bedrooms. They're **seeking a relationship** with a trusted individual. The product they want is a **vetted roommate matching service** with part-time flexibility, not a "sharing economy" platform.

---

### Segment 2: "The Yield Optimizer" (30% of investor sample converts easily)

**Profile:** Investor hosts who want maximum revenue with minimum hassle
**Size:** 3 of 10 investor hosts likely to convert (David, Jessica Filomeno, Rami)

**Payment Concerns:** 50% of investors mention payment timing (Andreas, Diane Kaufhold, John, June, Ramsey, Tammy)

**Ghost Roommate Acceptance:** 60% accept

**What They're Actually Saying:**
> "I have a property sitting empty some of the time. Show me how to monetize it reliably."

**Conversion Rate:** 30% likely, 60% conditional

**Key Insight:** Investors are **conditional on economics**, not on model. They accept ghost roommates because they don't live there - it's purely financial math. But they're harder to convert because they have **alternatives** (Airbnb, traditional rental, etc.) and evaluate purely on yield.

---

### Segment 3: "The Platform Rejector" (15% - avoid entirely)

**Profile:** Hosts who fundamentally don't want to work with any platform
**Size:** 7 hosts declined (Gregory Stanford, Joie & James, Kelly, Malvern, Patricia, Paul)

**Platform Resistance:** 4 hosts explicitly prefer "direct relationships" and ALL declined

**What They're Actually Saying:**
> "I don't need an intermediary. I'll find my own tenants."

**Conversion Rate:** 0% for platform-resistant hosts

**Key Insight:** These hosts are **not customers**. Spending sales effort on them has 0% ROI. The data shows platform resistance predicts decline with 100% accuracy.

---

## The Real Product Opportunity

### Not This:
"Ghost roommate marketplace where hosts accept rotating guests"

### But This:
"Premium roommate matching for part-time occupancy needs"

---

## Reframed Value Proposition

### For Owner-Occupants (The Relationship Seekers)

**Old Pitch:**
"List your spare room and get multiple guests throughout the week"

**New Pitch:**
"Find ONE verified, professional tenant who needs your space 2-4 nights per week - same person, every week, long-term relationship"

**Supporting Data:**
- 34.4% explicitly prefer single guest
- 34.4% explicitly prefer long-term (3+ months)
- 65.6% likely conversion when approached correctly
- Only 12.5% accept ghost roommates anyway

### For Investor Hosts (The Yield Optimizers)

**Old Pitch:**
"Maximize occupancy with our ghost roommate model"

**New Pitch:**
"Guaranteed recurring revenue from pre-vetted corporate travelers - we handle guest rotation, you collect checks"

**Supporting Data:**
- 60% accept ghost roommates
- 50% primarily concerned with payment reliability
- 30% likely conversion, 60% conditional (mostly on economics)

---

## The "Ideal Host" Redefinition

### Previous Definition (Wrong):
"Part-time occupants who accept ghost roommates"
- Only 28.6% of "ideal" hosts accept ghost roommates
- This segment barely exists (2-3 hosts: Jonathan Kim, Zein, possibly Sherene)

### New Definition (Data-Driven):
"Part-time occupants who want a single, reliable, long-term tenant"

**The Real Ideal Hosts:**
| Host | Travel Pattern | Prefers Single Guest | Long-Term | Conversion |
|------|---------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| Kris | Away 3wk/home 2wk | Yes | Yes | Likely |
| Deedra | Long Island weekdays | Yes | Yes | Likely |
| Scott White | Flexible schedule | Yes | Yes | Likely |
| Drew | Regular travel | No (but not opposed) | Yes | Likely |
| Gale Grant | "Not home a lot" | Yes | No | Likely |
| Stephanie | Part-time occupant | Yes | Yes | Likely |

**Common Thread:** They all convert well (85%+) and want ONE person.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Rebrand the Core Product

**From:** "Ghost roommate platform"
**To:** "Professional part-time roommate matching"

The word "ghost" implies impermanence. Hosts want the opposite - stability.

### 2. Lead with Relationship, Not Flexibility

**Old Messaging:** "Flexible scheduling for the modern workforce"
**New Messaging:** "Find your perfect part-time roommate - one person, ongoing relationship"

### 3. Separate the Two Markets

**Owner-Occupant Track:**
- Emphasize vetting, background checks, references
- Highlight single-guest model
- Position as "premium roommate service"
- 65.6% conversion potential

**Investor Track:**
- Emphasize yield optimization
- Accept ghost roommate model here
- Position as "property management alternative"
- 30% conversion, higher LTV potential

### 4. Disqualify Early

**Instant Disqualifiers:**
- Platform resistance (100% decline rate) - Gregory Stanford, Kelly, Malvern, Paul
- Co-op restrictions (decline likely) - Gregory Stanford, Patricia
- Explicit ghost roommate rejection + no price flexibility - Dana, Gale Grant, Hemeden, Joie & James

**Save Sales Effort** - these hosts will not convert regardless of approach.

### 5. Money Doesn't Solve the Mental Burden

**False Assumption:** "If we pay hosts enough, they'll accept more guests"

**Data Reality:** Only 1 of 6 rejectors (16.7%) indicated price could change their mind (Sherene)

**New Strategy:** Don't try to "overcome objections" with money. Instead, **match the product to their actual preference** - which is single guest, long-term.

## The Pivotal Numbers

| Metric | Owner-Occupants | Investors |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Sample Size** | 32 | 10 |
| **Likely Conversion** | 65.6% | 30.0% |
| **Accept Ghost Roommates** | 12.5% | 60.0% |
| **Prefer Single Guest** | 34.4% | 0% |
| **Prefer Long-Term** | 34.4% | 20.0% |
| **Payment Concerns** | 15.6% | 50.0% |
| **Trust Concerns** | 25.0% | 20.0% |

**Key Ratio:** Owner-occupants convert at **2.2x the rate** of investors (65.6% vs 30.0%)

**But:** Owner-occupants accept ghost roommates at **0.2x the rate** of investors (12.5% vs 60.0%)

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

The data reveals a **zero-sum trade-off**:

```
Ghost Roommate Acceptance  <---INVERSE--->  Conversion Likelihood

High GR Acceptance (Investors) = Low Conversion (30%)
Low GR Acceptance (Owner-Occ)  = High Conversion (65.6%)
```

**You cannot optimize for both.**

### The Strategic Choice:

**Option A: Chase Ghost Roommates**
- Target investors (60% accept)
- Accept 30% conversion rate
- Compete with Airbnb on economics
- Lower margins, higher churn

**Option B: Chase Conversions**
- Target owner-occupants (65.6% convert)
- Accept that most want single-guest model
- Build a "premium roommate matching" product
- Higher margins, relationship-based retention

## Actionable Host Targets

### Tier 1: Pursue Immediately (High Conversion, Good Fit)
**Criteria:** Owner-occupant + Likely conversion + No explicit rejection

| Host | Why Target |
|------|------------|
| Chantel | Single guest pref, long-term, trust-focused |
| Deedra | Ideal travel pattern, single guest, long-term |
| Kris | Perfect travel schedule, single guest, long-term |
| Scott White | Flexible, single guest, long-term |
| Stephanie | Single guest, long-term preference |
| Drew | Long-term preference, no objections |
| Jonathan Kim | Accepts ghost roommates + 50% travel |
| Zein | Accepts ghost roommates + Boston commuter |

### Tier 2: Pursue with Modified Pitch (Conditional)
**Criteria:** Good fit but has specific concerns to address

| Host | Concern to Address |
|------|-------------------|
| Kent | Payment timing + Trust - needs guarantee structure |
| Louise | Trust + Tax concerns - needs education |
| Sherene | Only one who showed price flexibility for GR |
| Dana | Would convert IF single guest (flight attendant, ideal pattern) |

### Tier 3: Do Not Pursue (Will Not Convert)
**Criteria:** Platform resistance or immovable blockers

| Host | Why Not |
|------|---------|
| Gregory Stanford | Platform resistance + Co-op restriction |
| Kelly | Platform resistance |
| Malvern | Platform resistance |
| Paul | Platform resistance + Trust issues |
| Patricia | Co-op restriction + Explicit GR rejection |
| Joie & James | Explicit GR rejection + Comfort prioritized |
