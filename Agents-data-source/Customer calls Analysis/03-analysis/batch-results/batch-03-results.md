## Notes

1. **Hemeden** - Clear ghost roommate rejection: "I don't really want that people were coming in and out of my house." Owner-occupant who wants ONE person, MAX 4 weeks.

2. **Jessica Filomeno** - Real estate agent who UNDERSTANDS and ACCEPTS the split-week model. Looking for partnership, not to host herself. Coded as INV because she represents inventory, not personal hosting.

3. **Joie & James** - Interesting case: declined male guest due to gender preference ("house of women"). Not a ghost rejection per se, but comfort-based rejection.

4. **Herbert and Jason** - Both short logistics calls with no explicit discussion of ghost roommate model.
