## Notes

1. **Gregory Stanford's platform_resist** - Clear case of platform resistance due to rent-stabilized situation. He likes the service but cannot risk landlord seeing listing.

2. **Gale Grant's rejection** - She rejects full-time tenants and wants weekends to herself. This suggests single weekday guest preference, not acceptance of rotating strangers.

3. **Diane Kaufhold** - Very experienced investor (15 years nightly rentals to UN diplomats). Clearly accepts ghost roommate model, has done it before.

4. **Co-op/rent-stabilized issues** - Both Deedra (co-op) and Gregory (rent-stabilized) have building-related blockers.
