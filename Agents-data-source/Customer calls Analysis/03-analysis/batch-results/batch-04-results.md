2. **John** - Experienced NYC landlord, but has strict upfront payment requirement that conflicts with Split Lease payment timing.

3. **Kelly** - Clear platform resistance: "I'd prefer to just kind of work with individuals directly." Left door open for future.

4. **June** - Real estate agent with multiple properties, interested but wants to see vetting documentation.
