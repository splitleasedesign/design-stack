## Notes

1. **Dana's ghost_reject** - The rejection is about full-time WFH presence ("cooking fish twice a day"), not about rotating guests. She loved travel nurses who are NOT there full-time. This is nuanced - she rejects full-time occupancy, not rotation per se.

2. **Chantel's single_pref** - Very explicit preference for one repeat traveler over multiple due to turnover burden.

3. **Most hosts are Unclear on ghost roommates** - The sales calls didn't always discuss the split-week model explicitly.

4. **No platform resistance in Batch 1** - All hosts were cooperative with listing.
