# Cleaning Responsibilities Report

## Cleaning Expectations
- Hosts lean on guests for turnover between recurring stays: Sherene sets ghost roommates to meet, collect a shared cleaning deposit, swap their own bedding, and follow Split Lease checklists while she limits herself to common areas and arranges optional drop-off laundry service (02-call-transcripts/host/sherene-call.txt:22,24,40,44,56,188). Patricia adds a $100 exit clean, offers pro cleaners at the guest's expense, and keeps Split Lease holding the deposit, mirroring Anthony's $250 one-time clean requirement (02-call-transcripts/host/patricia-call-2.txt:70,164; 02-call-transcripts/host/anthony-call.txt:67).
- Guests repeatedly probe who actually cleans: William Romano accepts anchor/ghost roommate roles only if the discounted roommate handles full reset duties, otherwise he worries about sheet reuse and hygiene standards (02-call-transcripts/guest/William Romano.txt:12,14,16). Tyler Wood, Stephen Petronio, and Steven Mariscal all agree to self-clean when it lowers price or keeps schedules flexible (02-call-transcripts/guest/Tyler Wood 24 November 2021.txt:41,43; 02-call-transcripts/guest/Stephen Petronio - 1 June 2022.txt:70; 02-call-transcripts/guest/Steven Mariscal - 21 April 2022.txt:38).
- Cleaning remains a conversion friction: prospects like Vale fear constant packing and spotless turnarounds if partners rotate, while Vince and Tamycka want reassurance about professional cleaning or at least time to disinfect between users (02-call-transcripts/guest/Frederick's Customer Call with Vale.txt:19,20,29; 02-call-transcripts/guest/Customer call- Vince.txt:9; 02-call-transcripts/guest/Tamycka initial phone call.txt:40). Sherene's concern that "two strangers that change" could erode her brand underscores hosts' anxiety about entrusting standards to guests without structured support (02-call-transcripts/host/sherene-call.txt:38).

## Opportunities to Tighten Process
- Codify cleaning tiers: make the anchor vs. ghost roommate chores, deposits, and optional pro-clean pricing explicit in proposals so both sides opt in knowingly.
- Productize shared tools: surface checklists, storage instructions, and split laundry options inside the platform rather than relying on phone explanations.
- Highlight trust levers: showcase vetted cleaners, disinfect buffers, or photos after each turnover to ease guest worries and protect hosts' reputations.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Draft a standardized "Who Cleans What" one-pager to accompany every match.
2. Add a checklist template plus supply list into house manuals for recurring stays.
