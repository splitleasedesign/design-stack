## HEARS

### From Split Lease Reps - What Resonates

**Concept Explanation:**
- **"Similar to Airbnb but we service people who need partial weeks on repeated basis"** *(resonates with Tyler, William)*
- **"Ghost roommates - you use Monday-Thursday, someone else uses Friday-Sunday"** *(William's concern)*
- **"You can leave your stuff there, guaranteed storage"** *(addresses Tyler's pain)*
- **"No short-term rental taxes because it's 28+ nights"** *(Steve Zhang technical interest)*
- **"Full-time lease for landlord, two people with complementary schedules"** *(Shomit gets it)*

**Pricing Dynamics They Hear:**
- **"$66 per night for 4 nights"** *(Shomit hears specific number)*
- **"Weekends more expensive than weekdays"** *(Tyler adjusting schedule)*
- **"Longer bookings get discounted nightly rate"** *(Taline hears incentive)*
- **"Nights matter, not days - Monday 1pm to Friday noon"** *(Shomit learning logistics)*

**Process Clarity:**
- **"Bid doesn't obligate you to sign lease"** *(Shomit needs reassurance repeated 3x)*
- **"Enter 3-4 bids in parallel"** *(encouraged to explore options)*
- **"Meet your ghost roommate on Zoom before signing"** *(William, Shomit comfort)*
- **"Takes 2-3 weeks to finish process"** *(not immediate like Airbnb)*

- **"I want to see what the other options are"** *(not ready to bid)*

## THINKS

### About the Concept

**William:**
- *"This sounds like having a roommate but we're never there at the same time"*
- *"Will it actually be clean when I arrive? Can I trust a stranger to clean properly?"*
- *"Is this legit or some kind of scam? He's being very vague about the address"*
- *"I need to see it in person before committing - April 20th trip"*

**Tyler:**
- *"This could save me from constantly packing/unpacking"*
- *"I'm flexible on which nights as long as the price makes sense"*
- *"December 1st is far enough away that I have time to figure this out"*
- *"$2,000/month for Chelsea is reasonable if it's a real apartment"*
- *"I can handle cleaning myself to save money"*

**Steve Zhang (The Founder Thinking Out Loud):**
- *"Multi-local is the future - satellite homes, not permanent locations"*
- *"My parents chose their location out of indentured servitude (debt). My generation has more freedom"*
- *"Living in two places actually makes you see friends MORE because of urgency"*
- *"Michigan really blows in the winter - I need seasonal flexibility"*
- *"Remote work is productive but I miss the visceral experience of shaking hands, hugging, being complete partners"*
- *"San Francisco is essential for marketplace builders, not for other products"*

**Shomit:**
- *"I've lived in NYC for years, I know the market - this should save me money"*
- *"Ghost roommate doesn't bother me, I won't even meet them"*
- *"But I need to see other options before committing, what if there's something better?"*
- *"$150/month for 4 nights/week is way better than $2,500 for full apartment I barely use"*
- *"My immediate need (April 15) doesn't fit their model - maybe May works better"*

**Taline:**
- *"I just need somewhere Monday-Friday near my job and my son's school"*
- *"I can't keep living at mom's, I need my own space"*
- *"Working two jobs, raising kids - I don't have time for complicated housing"*
- *"If it's just 5 nights and I'm at mom's weekends, that could work"*

### About Money/Value

**William:**
- Budget "around $2,000" but unclear if per month or total for 8 weeks
- Focused on location premium (67th & 1st, Upper East Side)

- **Would pay "$2,500/month" for full apartment** he'd lease alone
- **Wants "$150 or less per month"** for partial week
- Hears **"$66/night × 4 nights"** = processes as $1,056/month
- Knows NYC market, making calculated decision

**Taline:**
- Just asks "how much would it cost?" - direct, no budget stated
- Working two jobs suggests budget-conscious
- Has option to stay at mom's free but willing to pay for convenience/independence

### About Logistics/Operations

- *"How do I coordinate keys with someone I've never met?"*
- *"What if my schedule changes?"* *(Tyler has flexibility concerns)*
- *"Can I leave my stuff there safely?"* *(Steve: "unpacking everything three hours")*
- *"What does the storage actually look like?"* *(William doesn't ask but implied)*
