            <h2>Regular Landlords</h2>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Diane Kaufhold</h3>
                <blockquote>"I just, I just did all of that for years. I sold two co-ops on 54th and 52nd... I did that for 15 years, so I'm familiar."</blockquote>
                <p>A highly experienced multi-property owner with buildings in Queens and Manhattan. As a professional landlord, her primary concerns are financial, making payment guarantees and damage deposits critical. She is open to the Split Lease model but requires thorough vetting of the company first.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Andreas</h3>
                <blockquote>"These ones are 12 month leases on furniture. You can request the apartment a hundred percent, but that's an extra monthly cost."</blockquote>
                <p>A practical landlord with multiple units in Washington Heights. He operates with a clear business model, offering furnishing for an extra fee and requiring a 3-month upfront payment (first month, deposit, broker fee). His focus is on securing qualified, long-term tenants with excellent credit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Paul</h3>
                <blockquote>"It's a little bit too complicated for me... I'm only interested in getting a one month's rent and one security from them. We'll be done."</blockquote>
                <p>A traditional landlord who owns multiple buildings. He is highly skeptical of the Split Lease model, finding it too complex. He prefers a standard, direct-to-tenant relationship with a simple one-month rent and security deposit. He ultimately declined the arrangement as it did not fit his straightforward business practice.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>David</h3>
                <blockquote>"Okay. That's not a problem."</blockquote>
                <p>A straightforward and agreeable host renting a room in Brooklyn. He had no objections to the model, quickly understood the no-cost value proposition, and promptly agreed to send his information to get listed. Represents an easy and fast onboarding experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Jessica Filomeno</h3>
                <blockquote>"I have to be honest... I am interested. I obviously have to run it by my broker, but I am interested."</blockquote>
                <p>A real estate agent who sees clear partnership potential. She is interested in the model as a way to place her clients but is concerned about protecting her commission and client relationships. Represents a key channel for inventory if a mutually beneficial partnership agreement can be reached.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>John</h3>
                <blockquote>"Unfortunately, you know, I've been renting my apartment almost 12 years... when we signed the lease and when I received a payment, you know."</blockquote>
                <p>An experienced NYC landlord with a strict, traditional process. His primary requirement is receiving all payments (e.g., three months rent + deposit) upfront at the lease signing via check. This rigid payment structure is a significant blocker for the more flexible Split Lease model.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>June</h3>
                <blockquote>"I'm surprised I've never heard of [Split Lease] as well as I'm a real estate agent as well. I find everybody my own."</blockquote>
                <p>A real estate agent and multi-property owner in Harlem. Having been burned by high utility bills, she now caps coverage. She is open to the model and listing her properties but wants to see all vetting paperwork, expressing concern about guest quality ("I don't want Connie in the house").</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Malvern</h3>
                <blockquote>"I don't want another listing created somewhere on a website... My listing is where it is and that's where I just want it to be."</blockquote>
                <p>A platform-resistant host who finds the process "too complicated." He is happy with his existing Furnished Finder listing and firmly, though politely, declined to be listed on another platform, making him a clear "Declined" case.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Rami</h3>
                <blockquote>"Oh yeah, that's perfect. Yeah. Okay, great. So yeah, I'll send it over... and then I'll look into that."</blockquote>
                <p>A business-like landlord managing properties for his family. With experience renting to traveling nurses, he quickly understands the value proposition. He is efficient and agrees to send property info after hearing about the payment guarantee and vetting process.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Ramsey</h3>
                <blockquote>"I'm delighted to hear from you... I'm happy to work with a group like you guys, the guarantee is fantastic. That's nice to have for sure."</blockquote>
                <p>A sophisticated, professional Airbnb investor who now manages his multiple NYC properties remotely from Texas. With a 4.99-star rating, he understands the business deeply. He is very receptive to the model, especially the payment guarantee, with his only concern being early lease terminations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Tammy</h3>
                <blockquote>"The only way split lease would work for me is if you guys put together a lease package with two or more tenants... it would have to exceed what my monthly is."</blockquote>
                <p>A large-scale, professional landlord with over a dozen units in NYC and the Bay Area. She is purely financially driven and has a deep distrust of Airbnb's model. She is only interested if Split Lease can act as a full-service partner, packaging multiple tenants together to guarantee her monthly income targets are met or exceeded.</p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <div class="column owner-column">
            <h2>Multilocal Hosts</h2>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Jonathan Kim</h3>
                <blockquote>"I travel a lot, so I'm there probably about 50% of the time... I'm hoping I could find someone who's there Monday through Friday so that we don't really kind of run into each other."</blockquote>
                <p>The textbook "Ideal Host." As a frequent traveler who lives alone, he actively seeks a guest whose schedule is the inverse of his own. He is highly motivated, action-oriented, and sees the ghost roommate model as a perfect solution for his lifestyle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Chantel</h3>
                <blockquote>"Every time somebody leaves my place, I'm now doing inventory and I'm doing cleaning. So it's not realistic for my time for me to like, mid-week go run, make sure apartment gets turned over."</blockquote>
                <p>A savvy, risk-averse host in Jersey City. Her primary motivation is trust and safety, not maximizing profit. She uses a detailed inventory process for every checkout and strongly prefers a single, consistent guest to minimize her personal workload and risk. She is interested in Split Lease mainly to bypass local short-term rental regulations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Dana</h3>
                <blockquote>"I had a guy was really sweet guy cooking fish in my house two times a day... I will never do that again. Never. Yeah. Just, just too much."</blockquote>
                <p>A flight attendant whose travel schedule makes her an ideal host. However, a "nightmare" experience with a previous tenant who was always present made her extremely cautious. She now only wants low-presence guests like travel nurses, making her reject the complexity of a multi-guest model due to past trauma.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Gregory Stanford</h3>
                <blockquote>"I can't be posting this on any kind of website or anything... if my landlord finds out that I posted this on this shares side, that's gonna be very bad for me."</blockquote>
                <p>A cautious host in a rent-stabilized apartment. While he would "love to do this" if he owned the place, his primary concern is violating his lease. His rejection is a clear case of "Platform Resistance," driven by the fear of his landlord discovering a public listing.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Anthony</h3>
                <blockquote>"Okay."</blockquote>
                <p>A very passive, monosyllabic host. He asks no questions beyond basic logistics and agrees to everything with minimal engagement. His lack of initiative and desire for a hands-off process make him an ideal candidate for a full-service or co-hosting model where Split Lease handles all setup and management.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Cristina</h3>
                <blockquote>"I like about her, you know, just wait because I don't have the time. And you know, if you can't do the work for me."</blockquote>
                <p>Overwhelmed and time-poor, she is managing her boyfriend's apartment and finds the Split Lease app "very hard to navigate." She explicitly states she needs a full-service model and is the perfect example of a host who will only convert if all the work is done for them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Deedra</h3>
                <blockquote>"I work in long island during the week... So when I come home on the weekend, I kind of have the place to myself."</blockquote>
                <p>A host in a Co-op building who prefers weekday-only rentals to keep her weekends free. She is aware she is not technically supposed to sublease but is willing to proceed cautiously. Her primary motivation is to keep her apartment from sitting empty while she works elsewhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Dimitri</h3>
                <blockquote>"I usually don't deal with third parties. We'd rather deal with one person directly... still have their information, their driver's license, because you never know."</blockquote>
                <p>A hands-on host subletting his apartment while he's in Europe. Despite using a service, he insists on verifying the guest's identity himself. He represents hosts who need the service but are unwilling to give up full control over vetting, requiring a dual-assurance approach.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Drew</h3>
                <blockquote>"Yes, if you can text me your email address, I will send you pictures."</blockquote>
                <p>A flexible and accommodating host with a 1-bedroom in Chelsea. He is easy to work with, asks few questions, and is quick to provide additional information like photos. He represents a low-friction, straightforward onboarding experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Gale Grant</h3>
                <blockquote>"I've had people here, you know, the full week and it's just, it's too much... to have the weekends off are better."</blockquote>
                <p>A host in Murray Hill with a unique apartment layout that offers excellent privacy. Having found full-week tenants to be "too much," she is now strongly motivated to find a weekday-only guest so she can have her space to herself on weekends.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Hemeden</h3>
                <blockquote>"I'm not really comfortable with that. I don't really want that people were coming in and out of my house cause I, I lived there... one person would be fine."</blockquote>
                <p>An owner-occupant who is not trying to maximize profit. He explicitly rejects the multi-guest model for non-financial reasons related to personal comfort and the "mental burden" of high turnover in his home. He wants a simple, low-hassle arrangement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Herbert</h3>
                <blockquote>"Yeah, all the utilities."</blockquote>
                <p>A budget-friendly host offering a furnished room with all utilities included for a flat rate. The call was extremely brief and straightforward, with no objections raised. He represents a quick and easy onboarding with a focus on affordability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Jason</h3>
                <blockquote>"It sounds a bit odd that they don't want to see the place before they move in... a lot of people are like, this just sounds weird to me."</blockquote>
                <p>A landlord in Battery Park City who is very transparent about his unit's quirks (like difficult parking). He is a traditionalist who prefers that tenants see a property in person before signing a lease, finding the remote-first approach unusual and risky.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Joie Coelho</h3>
                <blockquote>"I'm a real estate agent myself... I have quite a bit of art and expensive stuff. It's own art gallery, so."</blockquote>
                <p>A real estate agent and art gallery owner, making her highly conscious of her property's value and security. The damage deposit guarantee was a key selling point for her. She is interested in the service but prefers a single guest to minimize risk to her valuable belongings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Joie & James</h3>
                <blockquote>"I'm more inclined for a female. Really? Yeah. So I mean that, I'm definitely more important female. Um, there's that we'd have such a comfortable situation."</blockquote>
                <p>A host living in a self-described "house of women" on Striver's Row. Her primary requirement is guest compatibility and comfort, leading to a strong and explicitly stated preference for female guests. She ultimately declined a male candidate to maintain the comfortable dynamic in her home.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Keah</h3>
                <blockquote>"Good... Yeah, exactly, exactly that, how it will work."</blockquote>
                <p>A very agreeable and easy-to-onboard host found via Craigslist. The call was short and efficient. She quickly understood the matchmaking concept, had no objections, and was willing to create her own account and listing, representing a self-service success story.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Kelly</h3>
                <blockquote>"I'd prefer to just kind of work with individuals directly... I just prefer to work with the person directly."</blockquote>
                <p>A host who is polite but firm in her desire to work directly with tenants, not through an intermediary platform. She wants to vet people herself and is not interested in the matchmaking service. A clear case of "Platform Resistance" leading to a decline.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Ken Chang</h3>
                <blockquote>"Yeah. Yeah. I get a rough idea, but I need a body now. Okay. Um, I send you my name, my phone number and my email address for you."</blockquote>
                <p>A host with future availability (starting 2023). The call was brief and efficient, focused on gathering information to get his account set up in advance. He represents a future pipeline opportunity.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Kent</h3>
                <blockquote>"Yeah, no, cause I wanna, you know, do my due diligence before I agree to anything."</blockquote>
                <p>A methodical and cautious host who asks excellent questions about the company's background, founder, and processes. He needs to see sample contracts and references before committing, representing a user who can be converted with transparency and proof of legitimacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Kris (Christopher)</h3>
                <blockquote>"I go away for three weeks. I come back for two weeks, so it's a weird schedule. It's expensive, you know, my part's expensive to make some money on this."</blockquote>
                <p>Owner of a high-value property on 57th St with a travel schedule (away 3 weeks, home 2) that makes him a perfect fit for part-of-month guests. He is concerned about his valuable art and relies on his girlfriend to manage the listing, making him a prime candidate for a high-touch, full-service model.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Lilly</h3>
                <blockquote>"Okay. I would definitely want to see the paperwork."</blockquote>
                <p>A detail-oriented owner-occupant who lives in the same building as her rental. She has strict rules about noise because she works at night. Before proceeding, she requires all vetting documentation, including proof of employment and credit checks, to ensure a good fit.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Louise</h3>
                <blockquote>"Okay. I'm going to think about this. This is a complicated situation for me."</blockquote>
                <p>A renter who is subleasing her own space. She is highly focused on the detailed tax implications of the rental income, getting confused about W2 forms and reporting obligations. The complexity of her personal financial situation makes her hesitant to proceed without further research.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Luci Chambers</h3>
                <blockquote>"That's sounds great. It's a little bit different than what I was thinking, but if you would do that, I can take a look at your website and then I can make a decision."</blockquote>
                <p>A cautious host who is carefully evaluating the service. She is renting out a room in her apartment and, while open to the idea, wants to review all the company materials and sample agreements before committing. She is "taking it under advisement."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Mahesh</h3>
                <blockquote>"I probably need that information to share with my management because they do require application."</blockquote>
                <p>A thorough host who asks detailed questions about the ghost roommate model and the damage deposit process. His building's management company requires a formal application for any tenant, so he needs all of Split Lease's vetting documentation to pass along for official approval.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="host-card">
                <h3>Michael Spear</h3>
                <blockquote>"Yeah, I was just wondering how they made a payment. Cause I don't have, I didn't give you more information."</blockquote>
                <p>A very direct host whose primary and immediate concern is the mechanics of getting paid. He is skeptical about the payment guarantee ("How do I know you're gonna do that?") and needs to be convinced of the financial security and legitimacy of the arrangement before moving forward.</p>
            </div>
