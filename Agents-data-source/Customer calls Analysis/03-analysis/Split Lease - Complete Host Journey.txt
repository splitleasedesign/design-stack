Split Lease - Complete Host Journey Documentation
Overview
This document describes the complete host journey on the Split Lease platform, from initial discovery through active lease management. Split Lease offers a unique "periodic tenancy" model where guests rent the same property on a recurring schedule (specific nights per week or weeks per month), rather than traditional short-term or long-term rentals.

7. Platform Differentiators
How Split Lease Works Differently
1. Periodic Tenancy Model
Traditional Platforms:

One-time bookings
Different properties each time
No long-term commitment
Split Lease:

Recurring schedule (same nights/weeks)
Same property each visit
Long-term relationship (13-52 weeks)
Guest leaves belongings
Predictable income for hosts
2. Flexible Schedule Options
Three distinct models accommodate different needs:

Nights-of-the-Week:

Best for: Commuters, weekend visitors
Host flexibility: Use property on off-nights
Example: Rent Thu-Sun, use Mon-Wed
Weeks-of-the-Month:

Best for: Alternating schedules, seasonal use
Host flexibility: Lease unused weeks separately
Example: First and third week each month
Month-to-Month:

Best for: Full-time residents needing periodic structure
Host benefit: Continuous occupancy
Split Lease provides subsidy support
3. Storage Between Stays
Problem it solves: Guests waste time packing/unpacking

How it works:

Guest can leave personal items
Toiletries, work equipment, clothes
Saves on moving costs
Makes space feel like home
Host benefit: Increased guest loyalty and retention

4. Complementary Scheduling
Concept: Multiple guests with non-overlapping schedules

Example:

Guest A: Mon-Thu
Guest B: Fri-Sun
Result: 100% occupancy, zero conflicts
Platform feature: Automatically suggests compatible proposals

5. Date Change Marketplace
Problem it solves: Life changes, schedules need adjusting

How it works:

Either party can request changes
System calculates fair price adjustment
Buying back nights: Host pays guest
Selling extra nights: Guest pays host
Encourages flexibility on both sides
Flexibility Score: Rewards hosts who accommodate changes
