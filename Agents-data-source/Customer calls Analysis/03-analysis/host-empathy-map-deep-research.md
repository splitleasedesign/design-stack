### Actual Observed Behaviors from Transcripts

**Robert/Zein (Weekday Commuter):**
- Lives in **Boston Monday-Thursday for work**
- Returns to **NYC Friday-Sunday** for weekends
- Only uses NYC apartment 3 days/week but pays full rent
- Immediately texts Bryant his email after call
- Never visited Split Lease website (only saw Craigslist ad)
- Posts legal name (Zein) on Craigslist despite privacy preference
- Ready to start "tomorrow" - extreme urgency

**Dimitri (Summer European):**
- Works remotely from **Florida** normally
- Going to **Europe for work** July 1-Oct 1 (3-4 months)
- Has been subletting continuously for years
- Currently has tenant through March 7th
- "Keep extending with tenants" - serial subletter
- Texts Bryant his email address (long, difficult to spell over phone)
- Will coordinate apartment showing with current tenant
- Wants to handle everything "within next week"

**Stephanie (Professional Upper West Side Host):**
- Scheduled call for exact time: 6:30 PM (after work)
- Deliberates 30+ seconds deciding which email address to give (privacy concern)
- Lives near **Central Park, W 87th Street**
- Asks about fees **twice** in 11-minute call
- Wants to do Zoom video interviews with every potential guest
- Only interested in **6-12 month commitments**
- Will review listing created by Bryant's team before approving

**Sherene (Healthcare Worker with Cleaning Service):**
- Uses **drop-off/pick-up laundry service** for sheets/towels/blankets
- Has **cleaning service** for common areas
- Healthcare context mentioned (hospital work implied)
- Spelling Bryant's name carefully: "B-R-Y-A-N-T? With a T?"
- Calculating pricing out loud: "$40/night × 3 nights × 4 weeks"
- Wants to "talk this over with partner" before deciding
- Checks **website map of listings** after call
- Sends video of room (not just photos)

**Nneka (Revenue Optimizer Fighting Rescheduling):**
- Manages **Airbnb calendar** as primary booking source
- Syncs availability across platforms automatically
- Gave Split Lease access to her Airbnb account
- Receives text reschedule requests from Brad constantly
- Checks seasonal pricing: sees $1,170 original vs $1,400+ current rates
- Manually blocks dates to prevent double-booking
- "I'm not going to care" about mismatched availability - firm boundaries

### Technology Usage
- **Communication:** WhatsApp (international contacts), iMessage (US), email for "serious" stuff
- **Work:** Zoom, Slack, Google Calendar with color-coded location blocks
- **Finance:** Venmo/Zelle for splitting costs, Mint/YNAB tracking burn rate on double housing
- **Housing:** StreetEasy alerts for "better deals," Airbnb host app, Zillow comparative pricing
- **Transportation:** Amtrak app, Delta/United apps, Uber for city commutes
- **Professional:** LinkedIn active (validates business credibility, researches people)

### Research & Vetting Behavior
- Googles "Split Lease reviews" and finds nothing (red flag or too new?)
- Checks LinkedIn profile of Bryant/Robert to verify legitimacy
- Asks for sample rental agreements to send to lawyer friend
- Requests references from other hosts using the platform
- Screenshots pricing and compares to Airbnb/Craigslist comparable listings
- Reverse phone number lookup on the company number
- Checks business registration/Better Business Bureau

### Decision-Making Process
- Hesitates for 2-6 weeks between initial inquiry and commitment
- Brings their own match (friend, colleague, acquaintance) rather than trusting platform matching
- Sets up "test month" to try arrangement before long-term commitment
- Demands Zoom interview with potential guest before accepting
- Negotiates price within 10-15% range based on perceived complexity/risk
- Requests modification to standard rental agreement language
- Asks spouse/partner for approval before moving forward

### Risk Mitigation Actions
- Takes extensive photos of apartment condition before guest arrives
- Locks master bedroom or walk-in closet with personal belongings
- Sets up Ring camera in common areas (but not bedrooms—privacy laws)
- Creates house rules document: no smoking, no pets, no overnight guests, quiet hours
- Requires security deposit matching one month rent
- Pays for additional insurance rider covering short-term occupancy
- Keeps spare keys with doorman or neighbor "just in case"

### Income Optimization
- *(Nneka)* Tracks seasonal pricing fluctuations, frustrated when locked rates lose money on rescheduling
- *(Sherene)* Calculates premium pricing: "Ghost roommate" complexity = $200/month more
- *(Scott)* Optimizes for FEWER nights at HIGHER per-night rate (values privacy over max revenue)
- Compares Split Lease earnings vs. Airbnb minus fees/hassle
- Spreadsheet calculates: Current double housing cost vs. Split Lease offset

## THINKS

### About the Concept
- *"This solves my EXACT problem... so why haven't I heard of it before?"*
- *"If this were legitimate, wouldn't everyone be doing it already?"*
- *"What category is this even in? Roommate? Sublet? Timeshare? Co-living?"*
- *"The financial math is obvious, but the trust math feels impossible"*
- *"Everyone I know wastes money like this—why isn't this normalized?"*

### About Control & Territory
- *"If I share, I lose control of my sanctuary—my ONE stable place"*
- *"My apartment reflects my identity—what if they damage my reputation?"*
- *"I need to see them, interview them, approve them personally"* *(Stephanie)*
- *"What if they go through my closet? My desk drawers? My medicine cabinet?"*
- *"This is MY home, not a hotel—there's an emotional line here"*

### About Trust & Risk
- *"Can I trust this platform more than I trust Craigslist randos?"*
- *"I trust my friend's recommendation infinitely more than this company"*
- *"I've been scammed twice—how is this different?"* *(Patricia)*
- *"What if they trash the place and I'm 200 miles away?"*
- *"If the guest doesn't pay, am I stuck covering their rent too?"*
- *"Is Bryant even a real person or is this an elaborate phishing scheme?"* *(Tag skepticism)*

### About Legitimacy & Category
- *"This seems too good to be true, which means it probably is"*
- *"Why can't I find reviews or press coverage if this is real?"*
- *"How do I explain this to my landlord without violating my lease?"*
- *"Will the co-op board approve this or kick me out?"* *(Patricia anxiety)*
- *"What box do I check on my taxes? Rental income? Roommate? Other?"*

### About Effort & Time
- *"Is figuring this out worth the potential savings, or do I just keep bleeding money?"*
- *"I don't have time to learn a new platform—can they just do it for me?"* *(Cristina)*
- *"If this takes more than 30 minutes to set up, I'm out"*
- *"I'd rather pay someone to handle this than deal with the logistics"*

### About Social Proof & Status
- *"None of my friends have heard of this—am I the guinea pig?"*
- *"If I do this, does it make me look desperate or savvy?"*
- *"Successful people optimize assets—is this smart or sketchy?"*
- *"Will my Upper West Side neighbors judge me for 'renting out'?"* *(Stephanie considerations)*

### About Identity & Self-Concept
- *"I'm a flexible guy, this could work"* *(Scott—identity alignment)*
- *"I'm not the type to let strangers into my space"* *(Sherene—identity conflict)*
- *"I'm resourceful and strategic—I should be able to figure this out myself"*
- *"I need help but admitting that feels like failure"*

## FEELS

### Financial Emotions
- **Frustrated:** Hemorrhaging $2,000-3,000/month on unused space with no end in sight
- **Resentful:** Friends with single residence don't understand the multi-local tax
- **Anxious:** Rent keeps increasing, income isn't keeping pace, unsustainable long-term
- **Trapped:** Can't give up NYC apartment (career/identity) or other location (life/love/family)
- **Hopeful:** Split Lease could cut housing costs 40-50% if it actually works

### Trust & Safety Emotions
- **Skeptical:** Default distrust in low-trust American culture—prove you're not a scam
- **Vulnerable:** Letting stranger into intimate space feels like emotional exposure
- **Protective:** Fierce territorialism over "my sanctuary," "my home base," "my identity"
- **Paranoid:** "What if they steal? Damage? Violate my privacy? Squat?"
- **Cautious:** "I've been burned before" *(Patricia scammed twice)* creates permanent wariness

### Control & Autonomy Emotions
- **Empowered:** "I choose who enters, when, under what terms—I'm in control"
- **Threatened:** Platform intermediary feels like loss of autonomy
- **Relieved:** When they bring their own match (friend/colleague) and bypass platform trust issue
- **Confident:** "I can assess character in a Zoom interview better than an algorithm can" *(Stephanie)*

### Time & Effort Emotions
- **Overwhelmed:** Too many decisions, too much complexity, not enough bandwidth
- **Impatient:** "Just tell me what to do or do it for me" *(Cristina delegator)*
- **Exhausted:** Airbnb hosting fatigue, constant guest turnover, message overload *(Tag)*
- **Pressured:** Time scarcity culture—if this takes too long, abandon

### Social & Identity Emotions
- **Embarrassed:** "I should be able to solve this myself, why do I need help?"
- **Proud:** "My apartment is special—historic building, great location, reflects my taste"
- **Judged:** Worry about what landlord/neighbors/friends think of "renting out"
- **Validated:** When Robert (Bryant) says "excellent business plan," "much needed" *(Robert feels understood)*
- **Isolated:** "None of my friends get my situation—they think I'm crazy"

### Outcome Emotions
- **Torn:** Financial logic screams "do this" but emotional security screams "too risky"
- **Curious:** "Maybe this could actually work if I set it up right"
- **Relieved:** Payment guarantee and insurance remove financial risk anxiety
- **Nervous:** Still anxious about execution even after intellectual buy-in
- **Regretful:** If they don't act, they'll keep wasting thousands/month (opportunity cost guilt)
