## Executive Summary

Igor is building Splitlys, a marketplace for "multi-locals" who want living spaces in multiple cities without continuous occupancy. His vision centers on democratizing location freedom and enabling healthier, more flexible lifestyles while solving real financial inefficiencies in the housing market.

---

## Core Vision & Mission

### The Problem He's Solving
- **Traditional housing is binary**: You either commit full-time or you're stuck with expensive, impermanent hotel stays
- **Multi-local lifestyle is emerging** but lacks infrastructure
- **Financial inefficiency**: People pay for spaces they don't continuously occupy, or overpay for hotels/short-term rentals
- **Quality of life**: Consultants, remote workers, divorced parents, and modern professionals need flexible, stable spaces across multiple cities

### His North Star
> "I care about two things: the American dream and health. A lot of people get funneled into this life that is ultimately really terrible. They're just trying to live the American dream, and I felt I could really help with that."

**Key Insight:** Igor sees multi-local living not as luxury, but as essential infrastructure for modern work-life balance and mental health.

## Founder Background & Motivations

### Personal Journey
- **Background**: Russian immigrant, NYU Stern (financial mathematics)
- **Previous life**: Built hedge fund at age 25, ran it until 31
- **Pivot moment**: Personal loss and realization that "tricking people out of money" wasn't fulfilling
- **Catalyst**: Burning Man experience led to clarity on values

### Key Quote
> "Why am I doing this? My parents don't need it. This guy is not alive anymore and doesn't give a shit. I don't want to make money for women. So why don't I just do something that's net positive for the world?"

### What Drives Him
1. **Immigrant work ethic** ("firstborn immigrant male" mentality)
2. **Net positive impact** over pure profit maximization
3. **Personal experience** as multi-local with girlfriend (now wife)
4. **Skepticism turned conviction** through customer validation

---

## Business Philosophy & Strategy

### Market Positioning

**Core Insight:** Arbitrage between monthly rental rates and nightly hotel rates
- Chicago model: Abundant supply, demand is the edge
- San Francisco model: Tight supply, different dynamics
- Focus on resegmenting customers from hotels to medium-term rentals

### Key Differentiators
1. **Tax advantage**: 28+ night bookings avoid 15-17% short-term rental taxes
2. **Roommate model**: Uses rent aggregation vs. income generation (different legal/tax treatment)
3. **Ghost roommate matching**: Innovative 40% discount model for flexible travelers
4. **Continuous space, discontinuous occupancy**: Can leave belongings, return to same space

### Business Model Innovation

**Two Revenue Streams:**
1. **Part-time space matching**: Weekday/weekend or week-on/week-off splits
2. **Anchor + Hot Deal**: Full apartments with complementary schedules
   - Anchor pays full price, gets priority schedule
   - Hot Deal gets 40% off, flexible schedule, tidies after anchor

## Product & Technology Philosophy

### Lean Tech Stack Strategy
- **Bubble over React**: "Moore's Law will solve performance issues"
- **No-code first**: Rapid iteration over engineering perfection
- **Integration layer**: Google Sheets + Zapier + Python + Bubble
- **Anti-over-engineering**: "Give it time, math will solve itself"

### Philosophy Quote
> "A lot of purists would say things like 'oh, performance, blah blah blah.' Moore's Law and Wright's Law compounding at 40%... Our performance was over a second on search page. People were like 'this is too slow.' I was like 'give it time.' And literally math solved itself."

### Strategic Implications
- **Speed to market** over perfect code
- **Customer iteration** over technical debt concerns
- **Resource efficiency** - avoided expensive React rebuild
- **Trust in technological progress** as competitive advantage

## Customer Understanding

### Target Segments Identified

1. **Management Consultants**
   - Monday-Thursday in city, weekends elsewhere
   - Living out of suitcases, unsustainable lifestyle
   - Current solution: Hotels or friend's couches

2. **Divorced Parents**
   - Example: Harvard grad needing space near ex-wife for daughter
   - Can't justify full apartment for part-time custody
   - Hotels inappropriate for child-rearing

3. **Remote Workers with Multi-City Lives**
   - Steve Zhang archetype: Boston/Michigan split
   - Belongings scattered, inefficient setup/breakdown
   - Want "home base" feeling without full commitment

4. **Couples with Extra Space**
   - One partner moves in with other
   - Keep original space, rent out weekends/weeknights
   - Maintain independence while cohabitating

### Customer Insights
- **Schedule certainty + uncertainty**: Need flexibility but also consistency
- **Falling in love triggers**: Major life changes create housing needs
- **Commute pain**: 10+ year commutes from suburbs create demand
- **Multi-local identity**: People like Steve who embrace "multi-local" as lifestyle, not compromise

---

## Validation & Pivots

### Early Validation (Pre-Launch)
**Brilliant guerrilla test:** Posted 1,200 fake Airbnb listings on Craigslist across 60 cities
- Posed as consultant with space to share
- Responses confirmed: "My commute is fucking terrible, I would love to stay at your space"
- Validated demand across Bay Area, NYC, DC markets

### Major Pivot: COVID-19
- **Before**: Corporate bookings business
- **Crisis**: All corporate travel stopped
- **Opportunity**: Airbnb gave host data to governments, supply dropped 80% in NYC
- **Pivot**: To consumer marketplace for non-corporate users
- **Result**: Airbnb prices rose, creating opening for different model

### Current Stage
> "We're close, but we're not at product-market fit. We're much further than we were."

**Focus:** NYC atomic network before expanding
- Deliberate geographic constraint
- "Fast feedback cycles" and iteration
- Blitz scaling approach with user behavior observation

---

## Team & Culture Philosophy

### Hiring Strategy
- **50/50 split**: Soft skills vs. hard skills
- **Source**: NYU Quantitative Finance Society (club Igor founded, now 400+ members)
- **Primary motivator**: Mission over compensation
  - Forces job candidates to rank 8 benefits
  - "Being part of the mission" ranks #1 or #2 for almost all hires

### Culture Through Crisis
> "You go through this really difficult time and your diehards stick around and your blowhards kind of leave. At first it sucks, but then it's really glorious because your seed is so strong."

**COVID as filter:** Team that survived business traveler bookings collapse has different "cloth"

### Geographic Hiring Philosophy

**Detroit/Michigan Skepticism:**
- "If your holding period is two years or greater, you can teach them San Francisco culture"
- "They value standardization over uniqueness"
- "Not in search of the unique thing that solves customer problems"
- "In search of stopping iteration"

**San Francisco Preference:**
> "I consider San Francisco essential for marketplace builders. If you were building anything else, literally anything else, any other product, I don't know if San Francisco's as essential."

**Key distinction:** Marketplace builders need unique SF ecosystem
- ~1,000 people consider themselves marketplace builders
- ~200 marketplaces doing good work
- 95% of dollar volume from SF, 70% by count

## Personal Operating Model

### Work-Life Integration
- **Hybrid believer**: Remote is productive, but in-person has unique value
- **Visceral connection matters**: "Nothing like shaking somebody's hand or hugging them"
- **Contract negotiations**: Plays sea shanty songs on Alexa "because numbers are so big, who the fuck cares?"
- **Relationship-first**: Promotes key hire to co-founder based on partnership

### Location Strategy
- **Currently**: Parents' house in Troy, Michigan with custom office setup
- **Challenge**: "Desperately lonely for really intelligent people"
- **Vision**: Satellite home model - Michigan winters "really blow"
- **Philosophy**: "When you leave for a season, you're more likely to see your friends than if you don't leave"

### Lifestyle Design
- Met wife on Tinder, wasn't looking for long-term
- Got engaged in Mexico City, then COVID locked them in Michigan
- "Learned my lesson about living in two places... it's good in non-pandemics"
- Uses own product philosophy in personal life

## Vision for the Future

### Industry Transformation
**Core belief:** "The future is the satellite home"

**Thesis:**
- Most people have location "chosen for them" through indentured servitude (debt, parental expectations)
- In their 30s-40s, people realize "there's more to life"
- Current generation (Igor, Steve) are "exceptions to the rule"
- Future generations will see location as fluid, not permanent

### Urgency Creation
> "When you're just living around [friends], you just end up not seeing them ever. [Leaving] creates this amazing urgency and sense of purpose for the actual get together."

**San Francisco dynamic:** House party to house party networking
- Other cities lack this infrastructure
- Multi-local living could replicate this dynamism elsewhere

### Scale Vision
- Not rushing geographic expansion until PMF
- "Ghost roommate matching" is "fairly trivial" to roll out
- Would be "friendly thing to do rather than good strategic move"
- Focus over breadth in early stage

## Key Strategic Insights

### Market Timing
1. **Post-Airbnb landscape**: Regulatory crackdown created opening
2. **Remote work normalization**: COVID accelerated acceptance
3. **Tech improvement curve**: Moore's Law as competitive moat
4. **Multi-local awareness**: Term emerging in cultural consciousness

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Tax structure**: Medium-term vs short-term classification

- **Geographic focus**: Acknowledges dilution risk of premature expansion
- **Team culture**: Aware of control vs. delegation trade-offs
- **Customer segments**: Different cities have different supply/demand dynamics

---

## Leadership Style

### Decision-Making
- **Data-driven validation** before big moves (Craigslist test)
- **Customer-centric** over engineering-centric
- **Mission as filter** for team and strategy decisions

- **Self-aware**: "Desperately lonely for really intelligent people"

### Values in Action
1. **Resourcefulness**: Russian immigrant skepticism → validate everything

## Implications for Splitlys

### Strengths
- **Founder conviction** backed by personal experience
- **Clear value proposition** with measurable savings (thousands to $10K+/year)
- **Structural advantages** (tax treatment, lean tech)
- **Strong team culture** forged through adversity

### Challenges to Watch
- **Product-market fit** not yet achieved (by Igor's own admission)
- **Geographic limitations** of current NYC focus
- **Scaling culture** beyond small, mission-driven team
- **Founder location** (Michigan) vs. ecosystem needs (SF)

### Strategic Questions
1. How to maintain customer intimacy while scaling?
2. When is the right time for geographic expansion?
3. Can "SF culture" be taught remotely as company grows?
4. How to balance lean tech stack with enterprise needs at scale?

---

## Conclusion

Igor represents a new generation of founder: purpose-driven, customer-obsessed, and willing to reject conventional wisdom (React, San Francisco permanence, engineering perfectionism) in service of solving real problems efficiently. His vision for Splitlys goes beyond a marketplace - it's infrastructure for a lifestyle that he believes will become mainstream as more people reject the "indentured servitude" of single-location living.

**His superpower:** Lived experience + financial mathematics background + willingness to wait for product-market fit + mission clarity.

**Watch for:** How he navigates the tension between his lean, focused approach and the pressure to scale that will come with traction. The satellite home future he envisions may start with his own company's evolution.
