Split Lease - Complete Guest Journey Documentation
Overview
This document describes the complete guest journey on the Split Lease platform, from initial discovery through active lease management. Split Lease offers a unique "periodic tenancy" model where guests rent properties on a recurring schedule (specific nights per week or weeks per month) rather than traditional one-time bookings.

Conclusion
Split Lease transforms rental housing from transactional to relational. Instead of booking different places for each visit, guests find one great property, establish a recurring schedule, and build a routine. The platform handles the complexity of periodic tenancy—from schedule-based search to flexible date changes—while giving guests control, transparency, and the comfort of returning to the same place each week.

The complete journey from search to active lease is designed to:

Reduce friction: Reusable applications, auto-filled forms
Increase confidence: Progress tracking, transparent pricing
Enable flexibility: Schedule testing, date changes
Build trust: Verifications, reviews, communication
Create consistency: Same property, predictable experience
This is the future of flexible, recurring housing—perfect for remote workers, frequent travelers, dual-city professionals, and anyone seeking the stability of routine with the flexibility of modern life.
