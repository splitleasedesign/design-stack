00:01 Monday through Friday, but not books. I don't want, I'm not interested in making, uh, you know, uh, I just want to take advantage, but the other thing is the room would be there.

00:13 So even if they came in for every weekend that say, and, um, you know, they could lead this stuff. I would like to, for at least like a three months kind of, um, minimum, I, I don't want a different person this week and a different person next week.

00:31 Can I Okay. Yeah, just for me, I want, I'd like to do a couple of nights a week. Um, ideally two or three, but possibly four.

00:46 I could definitely, you know, especially if I enjoy being with the person four nights a week. So Scott, uh, as well as talking about this.

00:57 So it does not matter if it is only Monday. So Friday, you might do some stuff like Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, or serves the Friday or Saturday.

01:07 It doesn't matter to you. Okay. No, that's good because there are some people who ask him for that, and that is a little bit more difficult to, to service.

01:19 So I will, I definitely appreciate you being flexible because it helps me also to serve as my clientele. That's great.

01:31 So in that case, let me do this because you are being so nice and so flexible. I will create this listing, but before sending it out, I will try to select couple people and give you choices.

01:52 So before I send it out and say, Hey guys, look on it. I will tell you, I have this peoples, this, this person's this person, this person, this is a, let's say man, or woman has this.

02:08 So basically you will see some profile on the person and you will tell me I'm more interested in that person and we'll go from there.

02:17 Great. Um, yeah. And if someone wants it like an occasional use, I've had it before where someone lived in the Hamptons and they just want to come in.

02:26 Like every, they want a room with some flexibility. Sometimes they come in on Mondays and sometimes they come in on a Friday and as long as they told me, Hey, I'm on my way.

02:35 That's great. But it would be their own room. They could store their things. They don't have to worry about Going in There.

02:43 So, um, it's, uh, it's, uh, it's a flexibility there. Um, so you want me to text you my email address?

02:51 Uh, yeah, that's what I'm missing. Like I said, I have a name and the phone number, but I don't have email address and they will take his information from the listing you have on that website and just duplicate it.

03:07 So if you have videos, that would be great. Okay. Cause I think I posted a video up there to give them some idea.

03:17 Okay. Let me take a look because I have that. Yeah, there is a video. I have that listing. So I have pictures, like a video, every single what is on that?

03:27 Uh, I can use whatever, et cetera, except I'm not going to put price like you put, because I don't know what, how many days they would need.

03:42 And so let's say if somebody wants four nights, how much would you want? Because you are saying two nights, three nights, 1000.

03:53 So if it is four nights, what it would be So 12, let's just say around 1200 for four nights. Oh, okay.

04:06 So for stage 1002 is eight. Perfect. And, uh, uh, would you mind to share with me exact address or it is the top secret?

04:27 It's not going to be published. It just when I established the account for the listing, I usually for our purposes keep exact address because I would need to prepare at least for you, if somebody will decide to do that, we'll prepare food, the proper Lisa gaming, Zed assignments.

04:50 I basically something else which we do as a company, we guarantees the payment of people. So if you do this to us, we're going to choose it was going to be paid.

05:02 So if the person doesn't pay it, we pay. Okay. Um, I I'm transparent. And I just wanted other people to be transparent now to collect a seat upper both.

05:14 Or do you call it? Yes. I collected people about the way we operate. We advertise it. The with Ohio's on you do.

05:25 And so you will for user as no charge ever, we advertise it a little higher. We collect our fee on the top of yours.

05:36 We allow renters to pay with the credit card. So we eat the C percent credit card charge, but it's something which usual, people who travel for business need to pave a schedule.

05:51 So we do that, which we collect the payments for four week period, every four weeks, because usually this type of people sink in weeks, not in months.

06:06 So we transfer your calculations from months. You will be paid every month, like you asked, but we're doing terminal manipulations to do it for people who need to submit expense reports and stuff like that.

06:24 So we just provides them that additional service. So it was like an expensive they need. Okay. How was that for?

06:36 Yeah. So I'm thinking like, right, actually like right about a hundred dollars a night. Um, that's how I came up with that idea of like $800 for a couple of nights, which I actually liked that I like this the smaller, the better, you know, the smaller number of nights.

06:57 Yeah. But, uh, you need to understand that, uh, right now I'm not trying to force you into something, but there is a tendency in general for people when I'm trying to explain that I, to get a little more, if I will find somebody who is willing to pay more, I definitely will give it to you.

07:19 I have not, but I'm trying to make sure that we don't price you out of the market because if we will price it too high for two nights, people might pay conga dollars per night for four nights, they expect it to be cheaper.

07:38 So it just, I'm just trying to explain the way market goes. So we don't lose the opportunity for you and me.

07:47 Of course. Um, so let's see, what is four times 3,400 tons for 1600. Oh, okay. Um, yeah, so 16, um, maybe for four nights, I'd have to do a little bit more, um, than the 12th.

08:12 Yeah, I know. I know that you would like more, but that's why I'm saying 12 is okay. Six 16. I don't know if it will fly.

08:24 I just telling you, I don't know if it will fly because I know that my words they want to pay and that will leave no room for me to make any money.

08:38 Okay. Understandable. Um, so, uh, the address is 33 bank street. So it used to be Bensley. Okay. I'm not asking was a number of the apartment because it doesn't matter for me.

08:54 I just want to make sure that it shows relatively close on the map when people are looking. So Yeah. And I put a little cartoon drawing.

09:05 You could see the building on there. So, um, it's the white building on a cartoon. Yeah, I saw, I saw that.

09:13 Oh, as that as real, because I wasn't kind of surprised. I kind of, what the hell is that? So this is, again, at least to click, I was looked like, No, I believe yes, it was as an artist, right?

09:28 Yeah. But if you look on the actual building, it would look approximately like that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Because I, I was not sure what it is, but now I understand.

09:44 Yeah. I, you know, just, it was something I added to it. Um, okay. So, um, maybe for four nights, like I said, it might have to go a little bit higher from the 1200 test, but ideally I would like, like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday would be fine.

10:07 Yeah. Like I said, two nights is good. C nights, great. To four nights, 1200 looked good. Going higher again, it's your call.

10:24 Tell me what you want. But, uh, I'm just concerned about my bed. Yeah. Okay. Um, because you know, I have to pay electricity and gas by and all that.

10:43 Then if they're using more, Usually as this people, when they come to work, they go to work and they usually come to sleep.

10:53 They don't use much, But still, you know, I'm, I'm responsible for that. So, you know, The more days then I'm going to be paying more.

11:05 Oh, boss, how about we'll shoot for, uh, let's say <inaudible> For, Yeah. It's a little more, but not completely out. Okay, good.

11:22 But maybe if they want to just stay less, they consider. Okay, great. Yeah. So let's do that, Scott. I really appreciate you calling, send me that text message so I can get busy with Cajuns list and hopefully I'll get you somebody that Okay.

11:45 Very good. Um, I'm just, I'm a single man. I, um, I don't have many guests and the place is quiet, so quiet for the city, you know, because it's in the back of the building, it's not on a major street, so you don't hear ambulances.

12:05 You don't hear people for their music. If they need a good restful sleep, they could just lock themselves away. And it's fully furnished it as a desk, get all kinds of things, but it's mostly old world charm.

12:19 This building was built before electricity. So it was all gasoline at one time. So, um, it's charming, you know, it's unique.

12:27 Yeah. Uh, I have another question for you. Um, I have one business owner from Canada who was looking for two weeks ago in the months.

12:44 Yes. Hey, hold on one second. Hold on one second. Yeah. And uh, he was looking for a place to have two weeks in a month, so he would need to come for two weeks and then he's gone for two and a half.

13:38 Is that something he might consider or is not what you want? Yeah. Yeah. I'll be over there. I'm the same, I'm a flexible guy and I you're really easy to get along with.

13:57 So, um, nice guy. I like Canadians. They tend to be a little bit more respectful, you know, certain people, but um, yeah, my private residence, I'm not a hotel.

14:10 Um, but yeah, they can use my stuff. They can come and clean and I have, So was that said, we will consider that for certain conduit a month because it would be the same as four nights about formats.

14:30 Yeah. Okay. Let me, let me see what me gets at least in first on the website. And then we will see what I'll get.

14:41 Like I said, I'll give you options to choose Maybe some options. Yes. But, um, I would like to try to do it like three months minimum.

14:54 Yeah. Okay. Robert, I'm going to email y'all. I was texted to my, um, let you know. Yeah. That's what it is.

15:03 Wonderful. And Scott, you know what? Well, I see no phone number, but just your main, what is the phone number?
