05:45 And, uh, we will collect our feet above and beyond forms, uh, people who had, you know, And then, um, what, who are your clients generally?

06:02 Who are the people who, Uh, usually it is business people. Um, but, uh, it's, it's two part of, uh, we have two parts of clientele.

06:13 One part of clientele is business. People who are doing Monday to Friday. And another part is people who live in suburbs, let's say, in New Jersey or Philadelphia, and want to spend time in New York on weekends.

06:32 And that's the type of clientele we have. But the way we operate before we rent it to anybody, we haves a veteran processes.

06:47 They complete the application. We collect the background information. We prepare the lease. We introduce that to you. And only when you see all information in front of you, you decide if you want to take somebody or not, you are not obligated to take anybody.

07:06 It's all based on the ask them comfort. Also, Do we have the opportunity to speak to them or interview them before we several, a week before?

07:19 Yeah, basically it wasn't the way we we're doing it with those a zoom meeting. So we host the zoom. They come in, you come in, you ask all the questions.

07:34 It's, it's all upfront and open because we want our clients, guests and hosts to be happy and safe. So there was no, there's no interest for me to push on you a client, which will make you mad.

07:52 And then you go away. I'm not, I'm not afraid. It's the same as Airbnb who sends somebody one time. And then, you know, it sees them again, this people come back and if they make you mad, my business fails.

09:28 So if we rent it for, to somebody, we collect the payment, you don't have to worry about that. If they don't pay, we will pay.

09:44 So that is something what we do. And that is, uh, another way of showing you that we're not just grabbing anybody from the street, because if I do that, I will lose my plus shirts.

10:03 So we're just dealing with the best part of the clientele. Yeah. So Stephanie, let me send you that information. Let me send you a link to the website.
