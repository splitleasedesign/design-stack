03:40 Well, as far as I understand, he is a young individual who, uh, who is, uh, for working as professional and, uh, he is planning to spend some weekend time in the city, but, uh, uh, what, we'll see what he has to say about him, to be honest with you. I was so tired, so I never looked on his profile.

04:07 Yeah. I don't want to lie to you.

04:09 Okay. Anyway, um, no show, maybe renting an apartment around the corner from me, my friend, when you talk To, Um,

04:23 And it's a great neighborhood.

04:25 That's good. Um, okay. Happy to hear that.

04:33 They at 10 o'clock, he said that. Okay. He's saying yes, I will be there. Oh, here he is.

04:49 Hello.

04:50 Hi James. How are you?

04:54 Well, oh, wait. You,

04:58 Okay. So, uh, I guess, uh, uh, my job is here to introduce you guys. And, uh, uh, James is looking to rent apartment for a couple nights. Um, the Joe has an apartment available, so, uh, Joe would take it from there.

05:18 Oh, you don't show you so, so what, so we're a house with women and it's not, we weren't. So, um, normally I wouldn't anyway, this talk, I, uh, I'm, you know, I'm, I want to see what, see what you need and see if I could accommodate you, but normally would, you know, we're, we're a house of women. Can you be more specific about a house with women? How many people are there here? I've been here 14 years, a young renter who is 26 in QC of permanently.

05:49 Right.

05:58 When I say I got one other, um, prophet has, um, you put one other person here with us and she's a woman. So she comes two days a week and that's, that's worked out really good for us. I mean, really great.

06:15 So there's this other woman that comes here two days a week. She occupies the same space that theoretically I would occupy as well.

06:24 Is your intention at all to have more than just our us too, you know? Cause she's two days a week and I'm two days a week. Do you intend to fill those other days?

06:37 Probably not. I wasn't even sending the pill anymore at all. You know, so I was encouraged to me and I had such a good experience, so

06:46 I see. Okay. All right. Um, okay. So, uh, so, um, those are my initial questions. If you've got some go ahead.

06:57 Oh no. What did, what is it that you need? What do you, you know, what do you need? Um, as far as the space, the space, just to sleep, let's say support.

07:05 Yeah. Um, I would say it's mostly a place to sleep. And then, you know, when I get up in the morning, I probably want to keep to myself, but I mean, like make a cup of tea or something, right. That while I watched the news and then probably heading out to get breakfast and, and you know, I mean, I may go out for a walk or something and then come back to clean up before work. So I may not disappear.

07:36 So if we're talking about Friday night and Saturday night, it's because I'll be working late both Friday night and Saturday night. So first thing I should tell you is that I come in very late, maybe two o'clock, maybe even as late as three o'clock in the morning.

07:55 And then, you know, as a result from we sleep, as long as I can, especially on Saturday morning, um, before having to go back to work on Saturday, who knows, maybe, like I said, start the day slow, and then maybe I'll go out for a walk or something like that. And then come back and clean up before work again, returned very late and then suddenly morning how sleep as much as I need to, but they'd get the car and drive home.

08:24 Um, so what do you, where do you work and what do you do?

08:27 Uh, I'm a television director and I work at CVS.

08:30 Okay. How old are you? Can I ask that Robert?

08:38 Yeah, I'm sure you can. James might not decide not to answer, but you can ask,

08:44 Well, I've got one more trip around the sun until 60 how's that?

08:57 Um, so any other questions you saw the photos of my place you saw the video?

09:03 No, frankly. I only saw her a couple photos. Um, I looked at him briefly because of when I originally contacted, well, first of all, Robert's email was on Craigslist and I didn't even know at the time that this was through split fleece. And of course at first we were talking about something else he had listed there. Um, and then you suggested they had the other one. I didn't really have a whole lot of time, so I always looked at him fairly real.

09:35 Okay. Well, are you familiar with New York?

09:38 So I live on Striver's role as a matter of fact, last weekend and this weekend they're shooting, um, um, that bar for our power. So they shoot at my block all the time.

09:53 Right. So I'm familiar with the term strivers role, but I'm not sure what street that's at.

09:58 Okay. Striver's row is in Harlem, one it's 1 38 and 1 39. Right? So it's this toolbox, it's always private alleys. It's almost like a gated community. Um, this, since the city college, I mean like five, 10 minutes, maybe 1 20, 1 38 between seventh and eighth. Right. I can stand up my door assist city college, my two blocks from the Hamilton terror at the Hamlet Borge Alexander Hamilton's house,

10:39 Right? Yeah. So it's practically an apple device as opposed to have them. Right. It's kind of right on the corner there of Hamilton Heights. Okay. All right. Okay. I understand where it is.

10:53 Yes. It's quiet. It's beautiful. I lived here 14 years. I love him.

10:59 Right. Okay. Um, so yeah, so, um, it's mostly it's it's Friday and Saturday, and then I need in the fall, my schedule changes once we get to December and then depending on what your situation is, availability, et cetera, uh, it's continues to be available with my schedule. We can potentially continue on from there. Uh, the Saturday night Baystate place with the Friday goes away December. And then I worked a couple of nights during the week instead, which sounds like you may have, you know, occupancy and whatever. I'll just move on from there. That was the case.

11:44 It's a small room, giant king size bed. There's fairly new, very comfortable. It has a half bath. And then the shower I'm in another room somewhere is another location. Um, so the shower it's, it's in the bathroom that, um, my other roommate has. So you just, you anyway, you need to use someone else's shower, but there's a, there's a, um, adjacent, um, back to the bedroom. That's private.

12:13 Okay. Okay.

12:14 And, uh, um, the kitchen it's like, I don't know, 150 square feet. The yard is 450 square feet. I mean, it's a lot of space. Right. Very pretty. Okay.

12:30 So talking about the term, you said that, uh, December your schedule is changes. Do you know at what part of December is the beginning? December or end of December?

12:43 Um, I it's it's, you know what, I don't know exactly, but I guess I had to have to look at, uh, uh, a sports schedule to figure that out. I worked at CBS sports. Um, so it kind of where basketball or football changes to basketball is when it happens. And it's probably around the second week. And then back to the boundaries, they don't work a lot. The rest of December, it's a little spotty, so it just kind of cages in December.

13:21 So right now, for the purposes of this discussion, we're probably done wrong, you know, it's early December and then, and then we'll just see what happens.

13:32 You come in Friday.

13:38 Yeah. Well, it depends on whether I'm going to come in and drop a bag before I go to work or whether I'm just going to come in after work. I imagine that once we get it going and I know how to get into places and everything, it's not really any reason for me to come in before work. So I might not show up until two o'clock in the morning.

13:57 Okay. So Friday and then Friday night and you need to spend Saturday night and then whenever you get up on Sunday.

14:08 Okay.

14:09 Uh, so should we say is that, uh, December 17th would be the last day of the lease?

14:18 I'm sorry.

14:19 It's probably earlier. It's probably earlier than December 2nd,

14:25 Uh, December, uh, pants.

14:28 I mean, if we really need to nail down the date.

14:30 Yeah. But you won't have to because we'll have to sign the lease and it has to have a date and it has to, and it is a commitment. So it's not something which you can cancel tomorrow. They will have to have a commitment for all those weeks.

14:42 Yeah. Yeah, sure. I understand that. But at the same time, I'm saying, you know, if we, if we to pick a date and then add to that date, it's easier than in this case trying to subtract from that day. You know, I say we should go through the end of November and then we add on a week or two, then if that's available and that's where we get.

15:08 Um, so December tens, you cannot, you cannot make it too short because then it goes into the short term lease and starts being questionable. And that's what you cannot do from a legal standpoint. You cannot make it too short,

15:29 But with how he's three months too short in all the wispies, they start at four. So I'm talking about 12.

15:43 What I'm going to need to do is just talk to my little roommate, six year old roommate, a young young, so it's, you know, talk it over with her and

15:54 Yeah, sure. And I, and I need to consider as well. I'm certainly going to take another look at the pictures. You refresh what I just wrote down. But like I say, for the purposes of, uh, whether you want to go forward or not, I would look at this as September through November, April possibility. Um, Eddie you're happy and I'm happy, you know? Okay.

16:20 So, uh, I would say is that, uh, both of you would need to come up with a date and let me know. And if I assume it's a book right now where I'm looking, is it December sewing? Is it November 26? So, uh, yeah, it would need to come up with,

16:41 Have you discussed it with my roommate and get back to you, you know, as soon as I can and then we'll just see what happens. Okay. Thanks very much. Very nice to meet you,

16:54 Right, Joey? Yeah. I'm here. Yeah. So what's your thing,

17:01 My roommate.

17:05 Yeah, I understand that. But I'm, I'm asking you your first impression.

17:10 Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. I'm more inclined for a female. Really? Yeah. So I mean that, I'm definitely more important female. Um, there's that we'd have such a comfortable situation, You know,

17:26 You have to go with the most important thing.

17:27 Yeah. By no means I am trying to change your comfort level.

17:33 I mean, I am so happy with Allah. So, you know, I put you in touch with my friend. She basically, if she gets first going, this would be perfect for him That she Could walk away. Um, so let me know, let me know when you talk to, um, you know, let me talk to a little girl. Yeah.

17:52 And they're, Let's, let's see what will happen and the Y

17:59 Well, no, I don't have a female just yet.

18:05 And then at this point of time, we can just say, You know, I appreciate your effort. Yeah.

18:10 And we can just say yes or no for this candidate and go from there.

18:15 Okay.

18:17 Okay. Good to see you. Take care. Bye-bye
