00:14 Okay. Hey, is this Tony? Yes.

00:20 How are you doing? Good. Good, good. You like working for an agency or something like that?

00:27 Sure. Yeah. Let me explain that. So I work for a company called split lease and Ariel and Amber, the two, uh, the two roommates that I mentioned basically came to us individually. Uh, they both have kind of similar situations, but we then match them as roommates. Um, and then, yeah, they're currently looking for a place in Manhattan and I can tell you a little bit about them. Um, Ariel has her own business and works in Manhattan. Uh, and Amber is a consultant who works in Manhattan. They both have primary residences and Connecticut and live there. Uh, and like currently they're just commuting into the city, uh, for work. Um, but they're both now looking for, uh, more of a sustainable solution, uh, where they'd have a place to come back to after work and have a place in the city that they can, um, use rather than commuting in and out of the city or using like a hotel or something like that.

01:28 Yeah. Willing to like, to, to be in the same. Um, yeah, It's just one bedroom that I think are fine with it. Yeah.

01:41 Yep. That's your work. And then, um, I know you mentioned there'd be a six month minimum, is that right?

01:48 Yeah. So each, uh, six months, um, the 24 months. So the Neiman would be six months.

01:55 Okay. Got it. And then, um, rent would be 3,600 a month. Okay. And does that include, uh, utilities as well?

02:09 No, the utilities, uh, is on this side.

02:14 Yeah. Okay. Totally separate. And then the, um, it would be available April 1st. Exactly. That's correct. Yeah. Yeah.

02:26 Okay. Got it. Um, and then, uh, just confirming some other things that said, uh, there was laundry in the building, is that right?

02:35 Yes. It is lumpy in the building. They also a gene on up concierge.

02:44 Got it. Okay. Um, and then, uh, just confirming the space would come furnished as like shown in the pictures.

02:53 So almost almost was actually, but actually, you know, like it will be the bed, everything in the bedroom and then the living room, the only thing that you might not find the, like the, the glass table, it might not be that, um, you would be furnished. So I think that, So the glass table might not, might not be there. Exactly. It might not. It might be, it might not because yeah, there are smaller things that we are selling, how we could, I'm going to wash the loner things I can bring with me the things that I was able to sell on.

03:44 Okay. Got it. Um, and then one last question that I had was, uh, about the deposit and, uh, if there's a deposit for the space.

03:54 So the scene, uh, that I did when I rented it, if I had the budget for one month of rent. Yeah, yeah, sure. So I assume it would be the same thing. I think it would be 3,600.

04:07 Yup. That's typically with the landlords that we work with, that's kind of the, the standard. Um, and then another thing which we do as split leases, we match that deposit. So not only will you get 3,600 from, um, or not only will the deposit be 3,600 from the guests, but Splitly smashes that as well. So there'll be another 3,600 held as a deposit.

04:31 Um, and another thing I wanted to mention is we have, so we have our own, uh, lease agreement. Um, and within this, we guarantee the payment. So payment is guaranteed to you as the landlord. Uh, and we kind of take that risk and Ariel and Amber have both been vetted on our side and we've, um, verified employment, uh, have their income, a landlord references, uh, credit checks. We've done all of that on our end to vet. And I'd be happy to share basically the agreements that we have, the lease agreement and then the supplemental agreement where we guarantee payments due as the landlord. I'd be happy to send that over to you. Just like there there's example agreements that you can take a look at, um, and look over and I'd be happy to send those over to you.

05:17 Okay. There's some great, um, the distribution, my type is that June time, I'm leaving a few months before the lease agreement and I'm basically helping Brodsky to fine. So like, I, I feel like I wasn't barely open cause I know how my feet was making their own way, but I asked him, Hey, did you guys have, you know, some guy have gone. That's great. So yeah, that's how it would be. Like, I, I, would you though, like w what do they want to be the, uh, the place or,

06:01 Yeah, that is something that, um, would most likely interest them. So there's still looking at a couple of places right now, and I haven't brought up the six month minimum with them yet. I, I'm not sure it would be a problem, but they're looking at other places now. And that's something that would likely interest them is visiting the space beforehand. Um, but again, I haven't brought that up with them.

06:26 Yeah. So happy to show them any time going back to New York on private. But if you want, you want me to send me the, send you my email, you can send me and share that with me.

06:47 Yeah. I'll send that over to you. And then if you have any, um, any questions or anything for me, you can feel free to text or email me. Um, but you can expect an email from me shortly after this call.

07:00 Have a good rest of your day. We'll see you.
