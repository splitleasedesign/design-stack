00:17 Hello's Gregory.

00:18 Hey, Gregory. How are

00:20 Good? I'm glad we finally connected. Yeah. Um, some, uh, reports, so you know how that gets, but, uh, yeah. So, uh, seems like we might have something actually work for both of us. Yeah.

00:34 And, uh, uh, I understand that you have a place in Chelsea and they are looking for the part-time guest. And, uh, I, uh, I do have, uh, a big interest in that because, uh, I have some clients who need to stay in Manhattan.

00:53 And let me tell you a little bit about our company. So you understand what you are dealing with.

01:00 I work for company called split lease and we actually service clientele who just need a, part-time stay something exactly like what you're talking about.

01:13 And at this point of time, our inventory on our site is very low and demand is very high. So we reaching out to the, uh, host like you. So the Craig list, she, they will work with our clients.

01:29 So if you would be okay with that, I would love to get, uh, your property on our site and present it to people who are here on the waiting list for this type of property. Would it be okay with you?

01:44 Yeah, let me explain. Um, so, uh, I'm not sure this is gonna work, um, this way. I mean, I, I understand, I wasn't my impression when I read the ad. So the thing is, is that the apartment is a, uh, rent stabilized department. Mm-hmm <affirmative> um, so the rules are very strict in terms of, you know, visitors. Now, the way I read the, the post was, you know, it was gonna be just one person.

02:16 Yes. It would be one person, but I have more than one for you to choose for.

02:19 So I'm allowed to have a roommate. Yeah. Um, you know, that actually gets put on my Reese as a roommate. Sure. For whatever period of time. Yeah.

02:27 You Know, it would be the same person. I I'm just saying that. So

02:31 For how long does, how long would the person want to be able to use The apartment? Usually our clients, uh, three, four months and then extent. That's uh, very typical. What, So they'll extend it, Right? Yeah. So they start with about three months. If they like the place you guys like each other, then they extend.

02:55 Yeah. Um, alright. But I mean, I can't be posting this on any kind of website or anything, anything, because you know, that

03:00 It would be, it would be a roommate there's no, there's no, I Mean, it can't the, you know, it can't be like people, you know, if my landlord finds out that I posted this on this shares side, that's gonna be very bad for me. So yeah. You know, Robert, I mean, I appreciate it. I understand what you're doing and believe me, if I own the place, I would love to do this. I really would, but I don't think it's gonna work for me, But, um, I see.

03:28 Yeah, but listen, I mean, uh, it's intriguing mean I wish I, uh, was, it was more of an ownership situation cuz then it would be no issue at all. You sound very legitimate.

03:39 Now let me do this. Let me send you the link to our site. You can take a look at that. Yeah. And uh, actually it does not hurt you to ask your landlord and say, Hey, I, I would like to get a mate from this side. Is that okay with you? If he says, okay then fine. If not,

04:05 That's good. That's a good suggestion. Okay. Yeah. So yeah. So send me the site. And then, um, now I don't, I'm moving back to the apartment November one and I'm gonna be doing a little bit of work on it for at least two weeks. So probably you're looking at December one is very realistically.

04:21 Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. People who we service, they usually long term. So they're not looking for moving tomorrow. They're looking for long Term, send me your link and then I'll next time I'm in the building. I'll review with them and see what they say. Sure. So, cause I've had roommates before. That's not an Issue. Yeah. Can you, uh, can you also text me your, uh, email address? It's a little easier to send you more information that way.

04:48 All right. That sounds great. Let me send that to you. And then you'll send me the link and we'll see where we go from There. Okay. That sounds great. Thanks Robert.

04:53 Thank you, Greg. Take care.
