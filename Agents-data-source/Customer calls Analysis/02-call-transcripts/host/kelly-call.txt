00:15 Good Morning. This is Kelly.

00:18 How are you? Good. This is Brian. Good to be talking with you. I know. Hi, Brian. Hello.

00:25 Um, so, uh, tell me, um, what you're looking for, how I can possibly be of assistance.

00:35 Yeah. Yup. For sure. So, um, like I mentioned, I'm working with Landon, who's a guest and he is looking for, um, basically part of the week, each week. So he goes into the city, uh, for work. And especially right now, I was looking to avoid his commute, um, and basically have a place to stay from Monday to Friday, uh, when he needs to be in the city for work and then, uh, just have those days each week. Uh, and I'm, I'm not sure if I mentioned, ideally he'd be looking to start in like early February, but he just has some flexibility with that.

01:14 Uh, and then a little bit about, um, myself. So I work, uh, basically as a matchmaker between, uh, like these types of guests and hosts.

01:25 Hold on just one second. Hold on. Just one second.

02:09 Sorry about that. So do you see maker kind of individuals that you got my tags, but I was saying I'd prefer to just kind of work with individuals directly in, this was one a, um, the, um, the nursing site, you know, short term and obviously that's where I can probably get some of your listings from. Um, but you know, I wanted someone who I can get a little bit more information as far as their nursing and just being more confident in who they were and, you know, uh, uh, huge. Yeah, that's a good app, um, opportunity that you offer, but I just prefer to work with the person directly.

03:02 Okay.

03:03 Ah, I hear you for that. And I, I definitely understand where you're coming from. Um, I'll let you know, like I'm, I'm, I'm working with, uh, Landon and I sort of am doing this discovery, uh, and then like trying to find him listings and I'd be happy to, uh, get any information if there was anything that you need from him that I didn't have already. Um, I'd be happy to do that. Um, but yeah, it was really just, he had shown interest, uh, in your listings and we're trying to find him, um, Sort of Something. Yeah, Ideally.

03:42 Yeah. So he's, he, uh, made it clear that he was pretty flexible in terms of like duration and start date. Ideally, he was looking for like three months starting in early February. Um, but like I said, he has, he has some flexibility and like, what he's currently doing now is really just commuting into the city. So that's always like, I guess his plan B and while he's trying to avoid that, like that's something he can be in the city. Exactly. Yeah. So he can be sort of flexible, uh, with that.

04:12 Yep. All right. So you know what, I have your number, if anything changes or I have an associate that has a property or unit that would work, I will definitely give you.

04:25 Okay. That would be much appreciated. Thank you.

04:29 You're welcome. And you're calling from Michigan, right? I Am. Yeah.

04:31 Okay. Now I'm from Michigan. I saw the 2, 4 8. Yeah. Yeah. I'm right outside. I'm sort of in like Metro Detroit right outside Detroit City. Uh, So, uh, where I'm working from now and I'm in Troy right now. If you know where that is.

04:49 Yeah. I know your way, Troy. That's funny. All right. Um, yes. So I will keep you abreast if something comes available. Okay.

04:59 Thanks, sir. Thanks so much. All right. Let's see.
