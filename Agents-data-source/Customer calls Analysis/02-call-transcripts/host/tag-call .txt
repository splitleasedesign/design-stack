00:03 Hello There. How are you? Hi, how are you doing? Good, thank you. Okay, so I'm alive. I not a robot.

00:11 We'll See <laugh>, we'll see who you are. But yeah, I keep seeing your postings and I'm just like, I don't know if this guy is legit or what it is.

00:20 Sure. I I can understand the, the possible concerns. So let me just educate you a little bit. I work for the company, which is called Split List, and we are servicing clientele, which is usually a commuters who are come and week after week after week to the city.

00:44 And they're looking for the space to sleep. And then for weekends they go back home to their families. So there's, people are looking to get the leases for usually three, four months and then it goes extended.

01:02 Depends if they like the place or not. Okay. And that's what we usually do. So right now we have a website which we, which we service people from, and I will send you to your email, all the information so you can take a look on what we are doing and who we're okay.

01:24 And I also will send you my LinkedIn profile so you could see me there as well. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, and then you will decide if you want to work with us or not, basically.

01:37 Okay. Where help both sides of the equation. We collect payments directly from the guests and pay you. Okay. So we purchase all the payments, we guarantee the payments of our guests, so we actually sign additional contact where we guarantee the payment.

01:59 So if somebody doesn't pay, company will pay on their behalf. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, we also match damage deposits. So if you usually collect, let's say $200, $500, whatever it is, we match it up to a thousand dollars.

02:17 So if all of a sudden there is damage, and damage exceeds your 500 Right. Give you extra 500. Okay. So pretty much we stand behind of what we doing and our goal is to have a long term relationship with owners like you.

02:37 So that's why we are quite picky of who we dealing with. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. And especially with Craigslist, although my current tenant upstairs, so I'm sitting in the basement right now.

02:51 <laugh>, he he loves the place, but he doesn't wanna be here winter, so that's the whole thing. Sure. But I mean, it's a, a great house, plenty of space, you know, I've done Airbnb in the past, but they're just a headache to deal with.

03:06 It's really gone down. Yeah. There's a difference between us and Airbnb. You get the same person all the way and over and over.

03:15 Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, that's what it is. It's the, it's, it's like having a permanent tenant except you don't see the person hundred percent of the time.

03:25 Right. Yeah. Okay. I will definitely look into you and your business and all that. Sure. I mean, it's a good concept that you have to help people.

03:36 Yeah. So I will send you more information with there is a pretty much stand out in my, I sent people like you, so it'll come out within couple minutes and it has all the links explains how we work, what we do, and another thing which we do, what would be good to explain is let's say if you are looking for the full-time tenant mm-hmm.

04:08 <affirmative>, and if we match you two different people, like mm-hmm. <affirmative>, somebody needs Monday, so Thursday, somebody else, right? Yeah.

04:18 So Friday. So Sunday. Mm-hmm. <affirmative> it usually brings to the host like you about 40 to 50% more. Yeah. I mean, that would definitely be a more ideal situation, but I'll, I'm open to both.

04:35 What else? Oh, and then like as far as this payment to you up front to do like a first last security or how is it work as far as that Goes?

04:43 Like how does that work? We collect the payment. We, us, the way it works, we collect it right at the sign of the release.

04:51 Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, the guests is has 24 hours, like with Airbnb when they come in and see if the place is as advertised.

05:03 Mm-hmm. <affirmative>, they can cancel within first 24 hours if something in the advertisement is, is false. Oh, that probably wouldn't work because I'm not always here, so I'm not gonna, I can't like, you know, a lot block out this time and then like if I'm out of town, I can't like No, no, no.

05:23 You don't understand. We're talking about the very first time, not, not every week, the very first time. Oh no, I understood that You would have to, but you would have to meet them to give them kids.

05:39 No, I mean, I have a code so I wouldn't, Yeah, that's the whole thing. I'm not always in town. Like, so I might not, But this type of things are not set up based on this exact date.

05:53 It's not Airbnb. If you are not in town this particular day between you and a guest, it can be arranged that it starts on the days.

06:04 Right. They've gone for like months at a time a lot of times. So that would be like, I don't have the ability to, if they, I mean it's a beautiful home.

06:14 I can text you like WhatsApp you the video and all that. It's exactly how it let, It's a good place.

06:19 If, if you are saying that, if you, if it is as good as, as you are saying, then there is nothing to worry about.

06:26 But Yeah. But then again, like, you know, not everybody's, everybody's comfort is different with areas of New York City, you know, so Well, they will, they will decide if they comforted if they have a comfort with your area.

06:41 Because what is going to happen, we are not going to give them exact address, but we're going to give them a corner street so they will see where it's located.

06:51 Yeah. They won't know which My return is. Yeah. Like I said, if I'm not here, cause I do leave for months at a time, I wouldn't be able to like turn it around, you know, it be being away.

07:02 Like, I, it would be, that would be very difficult. So that would be the, my, you Know. Well yeah, I, I understand what you're saying, but in the same token there is I cannot tell you it's never going to happen.

07:21 What if, what if you are saying you are giving me, telling me the truth, I'm telling, I also telling you the truth.

07:28 So somewhere, somehow it has to be a joint compromise. If it's if you want to work, because otherwise if it doesn't work for you, Well, I, I cannot, Yeah.

07:43 So I will send you information, you decide if it works for you or not. If you decide to try it, because we don't charge for, for advertising with us.

BEHAVIORAL NOTES:

**MASSIVE Trust Barrier:**
- Opens with: "I don't know if this guy is legit or what it is"
- Highly skeptical of Bryant's Craigslist postings (sees them repeatedly)
- Concerns Bryant is "not a robot" / could be fraud
- Bryant offers LinkedIn profile to prove legitimacy

**Previous Bad Experience:**
- "I've done Airbnb in the past, but they're just a headache to deal with"
- Airbnb fatigue (like Cristina)
- Current tenant leaving because of winter (seasonal challenge)
- Has house with basement (larger property, not apartment)

**Long-Distance Landlord Problem:**
- "I leave for months at a time"
- Cannot be present for move-ins
- Has keypad code (no physical key handoff needed)
- Major friction: 24-hour cancellation policy requires his presence

**Critical Conversion Blocker:**
Tag struggles with Bryant's 24-hour guest cancellation policy:
- Tag: "I'm not always here...I can't block out this time"
- Tag: "I leave for months at a time...I wouldn't be able to turn it around"
- Bryant: "It can be arranged that it starts on the days [you're available]"
- Tag: Still concerned, repeats objection multiple times

**WhatsApp Irony:**
- Tag wants to send video via WhatsApp
- Bryant warns: "WhatsApp is what fraudulent guys use...overseas"
- Tag: "The file's too big [for SMS]"
- They connect on WhatsApp anyway

**Positive Signals:**
✅ Likes the concept: "good concept that you have to help people"
✅ Interested in split-guest model: "40-50% more...that would be ideal"
✅ Willing to try: "if we try it and put it on the site"
✅ Sends property video immediately via WhatsApp

**Conversion Status:**
⚠️ UNCERTAIN - Tag is interested but has major operational friction
⚠️ Skeptical but willing to "look into it"
⚠️ Will review materials Bryant sends
⚠️ Not committed ("if it works, it works")

**Key Quote:**
"I don't know if this guy is legit or what it is."

**Conversion Factors:**
✅ Payment guarantee explained
✅ Damage deposit match explained
✅ LinkedIn profile offered (legitimacy proof)
✅ Long-term tenant model explained (vs Airbnb)
✅ Split-guest model = 40-50% more income
❌ 24-hour cancellation policy conflicts with his absence
❌ High initial skepticism
❌ Requires "let me look into you and your business"

**Platform Engagement:**
❌ No mention of platform/app
✅ Will receive email with links
✅ Will review website
✅ Communication via text/WhatsApp

**Unique Challenges:**
- Most skeptical of all 5 hosts
- Long-distance landlord (months away)
- Cannot coordinate move-ins
- Needs fully remote operation
- Previous Airbnb burnout
