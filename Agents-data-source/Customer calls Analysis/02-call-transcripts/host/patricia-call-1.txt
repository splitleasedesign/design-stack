0:10 Hey, Patricia, are you doing, I kept you a long message. I'm good. Um, what am I buying my building's a co-op and they don't allow short-term rentals.

0:19 So, you know, you're a company and that could be difficult to get. We all have to be very discreet. So that's my story.

0:26 Yeah, this, so this is not a short-term rental, since she's returning the booking, the booking would be over 30 nights, so it wouldn't be a short-term rental and she's Can we do it if it's a long-term random and I have to get number approved by the co-op board.

0:43 So it's a problem, you know? Yeah. I guess, could you talk about what that looks like for you in terms of getting them approved?

0:50 Like I mentioned that we do, um, the bedding, First of all, I'm in Florida, you know, I'd have to get an appointment go before the board.

0:59 Yeah. I think it's not going to work in New York, but I do have three properties in Florida, which will be opening up in April.

BEHAVIORAL NOTES:

**Major Blocker - Co-op Restrictions:**
L Building is co-op
L No short-term rentals allowed
L Would need board approval
L Patricia in Florida - can't easily go before board
L "Too much of a hassle"

**Quick Decision:**
- Call lasts only ~1 minute
- Patricia immediately identifies deal-breaker
- No interest in pursuing despite Bryant explaining it's 30+ nights

**Alternative Opportunity:**
 Has 3 properties in Florida
 Opening in April
 Would "love to do it" with Florida properties
 Will reconnect about Florida listings

**Guest Context:**
- Ariel: works in banking in Manhattan
- Looking for Monday-Friday recurring booking
- Over 30 nights (not short-term)

**Conversion Status:**
L NYC PROPERTY - NO (co-op restrictions)
 FLORIDA PROPERTIES - POTENTIAL (April)

**Key Quote:**
"It's too much of a hassle"

**Takeaway:**
Co-op board approval process is a significant barrier even for 30+ day bookings that technically aren't "short-term rentals"
