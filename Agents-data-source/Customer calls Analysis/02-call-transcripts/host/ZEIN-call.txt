0:58 Yes. Yeah, I'll probably be Away as long as that is the schedule that's definitely can work. So. Okay. Uh, with that said, uh, the best way is to do this.

1:14 If you can share with me your email address, I'll send you more information about how we operate, including the samples of the documents which we use because it will be an official lease.

1:29 So everything is going to be absolutely official and, uh, we will process all this. We will be responsible for collecting the payment and paying you.
