00:26 Hello, Tammy? Yes. Hi, this is Louis with a split leased Sam, how are you?

00:31 Hi there. How are you? How long can you hold one second. I'm going to call it. No problem.

01:31 Hello? Hello? Yeah, now we're good. Yes, we are

01:38 Awesome. I really appreciate you taking the time this afternoon. Tammy, as Brian had mentioned, my name is Louis and I'm, um, on the developer side at Splitly and we're just having conversations like this, just to get a better understanding of, uh, what are different customers and users, you know, what, what they're using the software for, if they're using it in general, just like, what are some of the challenges that you might be facing, uh, when you're hosting people and different ways that our product or something that we could do to make your day easier on that side of things?

02:09 Uh, so this, well, I'll tell you what, what is that? I don't understand that I can pay what I can make on a monthly basis. I mean, you might have the right, our HQ thing with even my [Inaudible] though their payments to be an incentive for me to use, let the, unless the rates are there and I can't, the math doesn't add up.

02:37 Right? Absolutely. So one of the things that, uh, that we do with that certainly is offers, uh, is that, uh, the nightly rates on our side, they can sometimes have be more profitable than the alternatives such as Airbnb, for example, depending on if you're a homeowner or you're a renter, so there's a little bit more technical there, but the reason the why it can be more profitable is because when you, if, if you're on split lease and someone else is staying at your own, uh, you don't need to pay the same level of taxes as you would at other places, because understanding your home with our, with our business model, they're considered like a roommate, or they're not considered someone that's in a short-term rental or that kind of thing where you do need to pay taxes. So from a profitability standpoint,

03:27 Yeah, I have like, I have like 13, 14, so these are not okay.

03:34 Got it. Got it. So you say you have 13 or 14 different units.

03:40 Are these, all of these in New York? I have my, um, I have nine units York. I have two brownstones and then I have units that I rent in the bay area. So when I get a request Liberty, I just don't see how I could commit two months of this kind of arrangement when I don't have a member of the tenant, uh, coming in and, you know, had that. Um, and then it does, if it's not adding up the, you know what, I get this, printing it out on us.

04:18 Yeah. Yeah. I absolutely hear where you're coming from. Do you, do you typically rent on a short-term or a long-term basis or both?

04:26 Um, we're doing 39, 30 day is, but you know, people have started to travel again. There's one work from home. So I think the only way lift these work for me is if you guys put together a lease package with two or more tenants, you know, it wouldn't really matter to me. It would exceed what my monthly is like at 5,000 per month, because I can look to people all day long at 5,000 a month for the two bedroom, one bath. Or do you guys have for a one bedroom? I can both off as 3000 per month. So if that is something that you guys are interested in as going, I'm happy to open my unit up to that, but it would be arrangements that you guys would have to basically create.

05:15 So those are some of the things that we are doing when we're working with our hosts, our, where we haven't gone with systems like this, do you understand, like, what are the, what does it take to make this worthwhile for you? And to understand what that means logistically financially, helpful to understand what your monthly budget goal is now that gives us the basis to work off of. So you would be open like with, so just to be clear, it does sound like you understand our booking model though, right? Like you get that it's on a part-time weekly basis and it's not typical a short, like, full week's day. Right.

05:47 Right. I understand that. It's just that if I commit to that, to the model of your faith, what 2,500 a month, then what do I, you know, I go out and try to find, and I don't have any way of finding anyone else. So, uh, I think for you guys, what you should know from my candidates that I have two brown buildings, one with five furniture furniture. So you guys can, I mean, like right around January, obviously I have to kind of that take both of the buildings full of November 25th to December 25th. So four are after that. And I know I have vacancies for radically just because of the past getting before. But, um, it is an opportunity for you to have a building where you can put people in and you can kind of create the like, but, um, and like, I have no idea. I went on, clients are coming from, and actually Evan pairing them with an eye better open or eyes that are not open. Yeah. So, you know, I can give you an envelope that I like, and you've got create the stage, but the bottle is a little deep bottling to me, how I,

07:17 So it sounds like you do have a, you have a minimum for the budget, so that that's clear. And it sounds like, uh, there's that November, I think to January, is that also consistent for the upcoming year? Or was that just for last year? Hold on one second.

07:35 Okay. I'm um, but yeah, that's a budget changes because, um, you know, I would be getting more summer booking than Columbia booking in terms of looking like a March, April, um, after Christmas, um, I don't know what it's going to break because people are working remote, seeing the cavalry different than rental or short term rental market and paying that. I wouldn't feel having a finger on it, but I know what I'm getting down and people are, um, you know, are too, um, but mostly I'm getting here and flipping upon and I'm not necessarily using Airbnb. I reminder, um, people are working and they found that Oregon. And when you want to, um, yeah. So if there are local people that want to come in and work say at the apartment, that things are great has to go up or I have to have it. So yeah,

08:51 Of course it's, it's bad on the, there's going to be a good economical economic balance there. Um, so is there a specific time, the year where you would typically have a harder time booking a we're getting your space versus the other, whereas other times of the year,

09:01 Or like, uh, probably from after Christmas, I got to be here too. Um, March, April, we were pretty much empty when we were at full capacity. So don't do be the one that I would kind of get ready for the spring, but you know, this year, um, I'm sure it's going to be the same way, except for the fact that there are nurses, but I mean, I certainly had it from the court unit though. It was a year. And so, um, if you want practice on one or try out one put together something that's profitable for us both.

09:47 Oh, that's great to know. I really appreciate it. If you think about family and what you mentioned earlier, I think there's a really incredible idea that we've been looking at. We've been looking into and applying, we've been looking at getting multiple people to stay within the same week to fill up the entire week for that particular post. So that's something that they understand makes financial sense and in some cases can even, you'll be more profitability than in another cases. So that's good to know. So

10:16 That was my hesitation. When you say I have a slip, they earn them until they're at 2,500 a month. What can I look that, so then what would I do moving forward? So I think that that is my biggest challenge is not being able to secure that item in an online model. So if I don't get anyone else from you, then you're my only kind of channel, but this type of arrangement. So, um, if that were to work, it would be because you guys have your finger on the pulse of the arrangement, you would have to book.

10:51 Right. And w one of the value propositions in our side is that we want to, um, provides reliability for the, for the hosts themselves too, right? To think this is a good discussion to understand, like, what are some of the challenges to you, uh, that would prevent you from having that reliability of consistent income? We definitely understand this. This is your livelihood and a big part of it for business. Um, so we want questions where you can meet stuff. Yeah. So I'm not going into, let's say you're, you've gotten a person that's interested. I, you know, what do you have? You decide if they person, if you want to allow someone to stay at one of your apartments Or whatever, um,

11:33 You know, I worry the money is tasting. If they have a fun, pretty much, they have to wear with all their, they're not working for [Inaudible]. My property is a little bit cheaper, but if you have $5,000 a month and you're paying upfront and there's not much risk, um, and people typically, they don't live in the area, but they're not going to stay there. I don't have a risk that you fix you. I mean, I've had maybe one or two bad experiences where local people have home. And, you know, I don't know, they use credit cards that were projects though, you know, they happened, but it didn't happen very often. There's a booking form. They fill it out or coming from another area typically. And, um, they paying in advance of the rental. So if they are working for three months, then I make them pay the first month's rent deposit, all of that prior to booking, then they phase in a 15 decade prior to the next month where they, their rental. I have some ideas up there. And, um, I also have electronic locks. So if it ever came to that, but he didn't ever come to that. So, um, that's how I, you know, I, it really isn't that big of a deal because people are paying upfront. If they give you their money, um, upfront, you know, they know that they didn't get a place to stay while they work a particular contract, whether they're in an internship, you're not going to have much problems because they don't have anything out there. Right.

13:20 Uh, so w on the flip side of that, what, what, what do you, what are the things that call out some red flags for you when looking at an application,

13:31 Um, local people, um, you know, if you live locally, why are you renting a check from their employer? Um, and what are they there for? What's the company who are they there and where are they going to be working? Um, and just their ability to pay a very large deposit, which isn't that large, because some of the people are trying to think of the whole day, which I know, because I don't think that happened. The client nurses can't pay that, you know, they can't say the whole thing cause they have a mortgage at home. Um, and so, uh, any kind of anxiety about, let me start today, you know, I've had guests that you don't want to start today because the credit card doesn't fall. Um, and no one would know if the credit card was called. I actually added guidance date two weeks on fraudulent credit cards for a while. And yeah. So, um, you know, I mean, it's happened, we've been doing that for them, but, um, it's not the put it that way. And if I sent anything and so I've been using a lot of stuff, so there's really no room for error with them.

15:01 Okay. That's great. So Zell seems like it's a pretty reliable and frequent option for you. Do you use any other main payment methods?

15:10 I mean, I take credit cards, but you know, they can always just use credit card. They can't get money back from the, I wasn't using Venmo and they started charging in the paper. I just do not like, because they don't resolve this adequate in the police, you know, I guess, cause they all, I can't travel because of this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that. Um, and Molly not so bad. And then if, um, they want, they can do credit card, but I charge a 5% of that. Okay.

15:44 Okay. And you had mentioned that you had one of the key things you like to know is like, you know what, they're there for, or can, can you expand on that a little bit more and help me understand why that's, why that's important?

15:57 Because I mean, if they're a nurse and they're going to be working at a particular hospital, I know where they're working, I know what they're doing. I know other companies. Um, and I said that looking for, and they tell me when they live, they could be, they're hard to contact. So I have some information as to where they come from and what they're there for. And, um, the fact that they can pay the deposit is evidence of their ability to pay. So if they are working and then they don't pay and I have the place where they're working at, so I can contact their employer. But like I said, I've never come to that. Um, and uh, if I deal with Airbnb, they're even getting this deed because they're not collecting the whole amount. So then those that do eat a problem, collecting payments, um, and that's, and then Airbnb just kind of leaves you to your own devices just against that. Yeah. That's very true.

16:53 That is very true. Um, and I mean, I really can't stand Airbnb and I'm mean, I just think that they have a, that is the model of bad customer service model. They support the client or the landlord. They take too much control over damages. And if they're very time consuming and know that they can get an Airbnb, make a complaint and they get a refund. And as if enough of these residences are, you know, perfect residences that have no, um, issues that hotels are not perfect residents with no issues. And then, you know, they come into our failures, stepping on carpet, that's been used by tons of people, you know, I have are the floors, you know, they seem like a mark on the wall, they're taking a close up picture and their BMP is, has ended. And so, um, a lot of times you can, you know, can take them off there if you see, that is not my thing to do. I don't. I prefer to you as a company. Cause I have, because you have what, I didn't touch the last book. You know, if I, if I use like a [Inaudible] and if I'm getting people in and out, I don't prefer to take them off the website. And it's not the feed that I'm concerned about. It's um, the fact that, you know, I don't do Airbnb. There's so much bureaucracy and there's so much lack of balance about what they need to do in terms of landlords in supporting the owner because without the owner, they wouldn't have the property. Oh, of course. And yeah, so they, to me have a kind of, um, I mean, you know, they kind of started, so everyone now wants the Airbnb quote, unquote, they don't have the best model. I prefer the RPO. They kind of hands off a little bit and um, you know, they step in when they can, they add a couple of places and if not, then they leave, you read the biology people deal with. So, um,

19:03 Can you give me a little bit more, maybe some more details or examples around what you like about VRVO some more,

19:12 Yeah, that'd be, I was just a little less, um, they're a little more hands off. They kind of let you set the policy. They just of, you're kind of just take a more, like they send you set the policy. Um, they may ask you a question they may ask you, you know, are you willing to give this Greg got the credit because of them or that if you say no, it's just no, you know, if they don't make an alternative position. And so, um, I liked that because it allows the landlord, you know, some control over them. I mean, with the pandemic, it was a little, it would give you incentives to cancel, to allow them to cancel for free. Whereas Airbnb just canceled everyone and left the painting, you know? And so that was, you know, they have to be prepared, you know, they have to accommodate both the landlord and the kids. I mean, they could have given you ass cancellation [Inaudible] because of they're renting for other, oh, you know, I can't be responsible for their financial wherewithal and they have trip insurance. So, you know, Airbnb could have very well offered trip insurance, um, and uh, you know, they didn't do that. And so, you know, they left the landlord holding bag. So a lot of landlords that I'm finding owners that are doing short term rentals, they're just starting to rent off their own sites. So I think that, um, there's an opportunity or, um, especially in New York city, um, where, you know, you can, there's an opportunity to kind of make it a little bit better, a little hands-off and supporting the landlords and then they'll do this. We'll certainly open up. But after this last episode with the pandemic and Airbnb being his primary provider of short term rental, people just couldn't risk it anymore.

21:24 Yeah. Yeah. It's just definitely a big amount of risk there. Uh, I think that's really interesting, like you mentioned that there's that trend that people making their own sites, uh, on, in, in New York and just going through there, that's really indicative of how they feel about the, what the options in the market. It sounds like they're looking for something else.

21:45 And then, I mean, just the city of New York, they know short-term rentals when you have your EDS and all kinds of family coming with nine guests and where are they going to stay? You know what I mean? I'm going to garbage people, can't stay in a hotel room and they can't afford it with, you know, kids, all of that. And then also to New York recently had a moratorium on building new hall and stuff. So, um, people are certainly going to come into the ER, they certainly are gonna find short Shepherdsville and they're not going to stay at hotels if they're coming with two families and that's how European Australian kind of people travel. So, um, that's gonna continue. Um, and they're going to have to find a way in New York. I think Airbnb, it kind of pissed them off. And I think that the hotel lobby had, uh, really stuck there, you know, um, they had a lot of influence on Airbnb, no new hotel, that kind of thing, but New York is gonna suffer because there's not a lot of people wanting to come back to New York. There's not that much. There are a lot of businesses that closed. Um, I think it real, you know, um, there will be a resurgence of travel duty. They're not going to be able to accommodate their point like deflect. There is hardly a lot of people looking now. I can't find anything on the court. I don't want to stay at hotels. Um, the hotel all the way into downtown, you know, and people want to be in a residential environment. So I think there is a market opportunity for that. I haven't, you know, kind of employment that because I've had my places booked with monthly renters and you know, it's been kind of a light vacation for me. So, um, yeah, I think, uh, if you can, you know, kind of take advantage of therapy and B's inability to kind of operate in New York and, you know, basically manage the rental in terms of what your model is, I think that you would do well. Okay.

24:05 Absolutely. There's definitely a big opportunity there. Uh, give me a moment here. I'm just looking if there's any other questions that I might have for you, there is one here. That's something that we really, our team is really exploring. And we're really curious to hear your feedback on, uh, would you be willing to provide like a trial night or for a person to try out a night at one of your apartments if we covered the cleaning costs?

24:35 Um, only reason that that wouldn't work is because that was prevent a monthly rental. So they use date. Okay. This person can try it out at night. Um, I wouldn't want that many people in my place trying it out. It wouldn't be, um, something you don't want just everybody and anyone coming in here, if they're not committed, you know, and I mean, and, um, I think a month trial, you know, our two weeks trial, but it has to pay a nightly rate or a week trial, but they'd have to pay a nightly rate these monthly. Yeah. So even

25:16 On a, it sounds like even on a weekly basis, that that point you're starting to see the opportunity for, for profit there. Um, and as you can imagine differ from our, oh, actually, let me, let me ask you this. Like when, when do you think, when you hear the word trial night or when we say try it out for an egg, what, what do you think that means? Like the immediate and what in the future for that person? Let's try it

25:38 Last, my calendar from other longer bookings. Okay.

25:47 Yeah. I can definitely see that. See that being a challenge, especially when you manage so many different properties. Um, so,

25:52 And it's been, if you just, okay. I got the first thing coming in on Monday and then I have a person that wants Monday through the next two months. I mean, I'm not obligated to this one night and, um, uh, you know, excluding two nights, I mean, two months. Yeah. So, um, I can see, you know, someone from your company coming in and taking a look, you know, and saying all the properties have been verified, but, you know, with the pandemic people coming in, I just, I would be trapping.

26:29 That is very true. Uh, so it sounds like the circumstances, uh, if you can confirm this, this, it would, then you would be willing to host a trial night would be, uh, when you have lower traffic and as well, if, if this day was for longer, just a night ride, like I do a trial week,

26:51 But they would have to pay for that. They would be paying an ICU rate. Okay.

26:59 No, that's very helpful information to any really appreciate that. Um, and you know, in general, as a host, are there, what are, what are some of the challenges that you face, uh, when this could be, you know, before you host someone during or after your hostess in general, like, what are some of the challenges that you face when, uh, hosting pay first?

27:25 Well, my properties are in Harlem, so, um, you get the, I don't feel safe. I feel, and that, you know, is, uh, uh, the feeling of safety is like illusory and that very nebulous. And I'm not in a bad area, like right by whole foods.

27:50 And people are getting maybe the turd almost because a little occasion

27:56 Or they get there and then they, they're not, well, people aren't used to New York, so go, especially American travel, but then the pandemic, all I'm getting are American travelers and they are, you know, to me the worst one because European travel is a little bit more worldly. They travel more, they've been to different places. They understand the different environments and love the more sophisticated, the American travelers, less complicated. And, uh, yeah, but that's just been the challenge so far. Um, other challenges are just white comes with hosting people on end residences, as opposed to dedicated hotel, because rather than says our residency that you might have, you know, all the water's not coming out or the, you know, we saw a house, which, you know, we'd be there. We unload the, have any of these things happen, but they happen, you know what I mean? It's so, um, that's the only balance that I see in York city is, um, people not cleaning up after themselves, um, knowing how to maintain properties, do your cities in different areas. You gotta do all these different things, but you know, it's not anything that I find that it's just yelling customer service issues.

29:21 Yeah. Because yeah, maintaining good customer service at this challenging on this island, it's hard, even harder when you can have travelers that I know people that stay, that aren't willing to work with you. So I definitely understand that.

29:35 Yeah. Some people you can't leave. And so, um, but we have onsite, you don't have onsite managers, but I have managed all my locations. So if they have a problem, they come the next day or that day, and we'd go with an L we have a maintenance is extended right away. So we don't, you know, it's not like we can't handle the issue. It's still customer service hospitality back in. That's the only frustration I have with though.

30:11 Yeah, absolutely. Well, Tammy, I believe that's all the questions that I really have, uh, that we wanted to get your feedback on. So I really appreciate that. I'm going to take some of the feedback that you pass along here and try to, you know, make some changes into our product and through our website, just to get your feedback on. Would you mind if I send you something next week?

30:34 Sure. I would be fine.

30:37 Fantastic. That's that's great. I'm really looking forward to this. This has been such a great and helpful conversation. Really, really appreciate it. Yeah,

30:48 No problem. Feel free to send me anything. I think that, uh, the split release would work for any honor. It was very lucrative. So, um, I think that's it.

31:00 Thanks so much, Tammy. I hope you have a great weekend and safe travels.

31:05 All right. Thank you. Bye.
