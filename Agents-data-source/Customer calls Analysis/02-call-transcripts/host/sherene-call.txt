00:08 Hey, thanks for taking my call. Thanks for Calling. Yeah, of course. How are you doing Sharon? I'm great. Thank you.

00:14 And one of your first name again? Uh, Bryant Bryant. What was that? Yes. Yes. With a T that's a good catch.

00:23 Yeah, usually I get a, I get Brian a lot, but yeah. And is it VR? Y and T? Yup. Yup.

00:33 Okay. Right. Okay. So let me just go back to your 10 step. Walk me through the scenario For sure. Yeah, so, so this is a, what we call like a ghost roommate situation with, uh, these two guests who would be at the same room.

00:50 Um, so they'd both be interested in your room and then one, just for one part of the week and the other for, uh, the other part of the weekend.

00:56 And like you mentioned, it would be six nights in total. Um, and typically for cleaning. So it will have these ghost roommates do is because they're returning each week and consistently using the space and there's not necessarily like a usual check-in or check-out process.

01:14 Um, and because they're returning, we have them eat meat and then basically decide amongst themselves, uh, how the cleaning will work as well as collect the cleaning deposit from them.

01:25 So I know you mentioned the currently get a cleaning service to clean the room. Um, so yeah, like, like I mentioned, usually the ghost roommates will be cleaning themselves and manage the cleaning between themselves and because of the split that they have here, uh, like Greg would be looking for the weekdays and then Johann on the weekends.

01:45 So that time in between, um, would be, I think the Thursday night would be where the handoff is, would be, um, like where glad Greg could do cleaning on that Thursday right before, uh, Johan comes in and then vice versa when Johan is leaving on a Sunday, I think it would be Okay.

02:03 And what about the laundry? Like the bedding, Uh, the laundry? Uh, yeah. Did you, can you mention again how you had, uh, or how you currently do laundry?

02:12 You said you had a service for that as well. Yes. Um, we have a services drop sauce and pick up, picks up the laundry and they do the sheets.

02:21 Towels. Blankets, Yeah. Okay. And that's just like typically an extra charge that you'll do on the booking? Uh, typically yes, that's what we do, but there is a laundry mat right on the corner.

02:36 I don't know if they want to just do their own. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. So that could be potentially another option and that's something I can talk to them about as well.

02:44 Uh, if they would be, if they'd prefer to just do that. Um, but yeah, that's something I can talk with them about.

02:51 Okay. That's my concern. Um, or just my, just in terms of my business model, like person can't show up in an event, the room is not right clean with like fresh everything know.

03:03 So they get a lot of saying one of you're responsible for them And some something which we've done as well, which, um, could help, is like basically give separate sheets and provide separate sheets to each guest.

03:15 And that's something even like we've done in the past is do that. So, um, like it could be something where maybe at the end of each, uh, stage, they just take off their sheets and then the other person has theirs that way.

03:30 It avoids the need of like cleaning the sheets every time there's a, there's a switch or every week. Um, and instead just having their own sheets, which I, like you mentioned having that storage space, uh, like even like just that closet would, would work really well.

03:45 And talking with both of them, it seems like just having a place to have some clothes is really just the primary, uh, use just so you're not having to carry like a suitcase each time you're coming in.

03:59 And, and also, I want to mention too, we can, I know you mentioned you'd be looking for a thousand a month and, and one thing with these ghosts roommate situations we see a lot of the time is we're able to, um, provide the host with a better price than what they're asking for.

04:15 And it looks like this will be the case as well, uh, where we can give you, um, uh, common say you higher than a thousand for the month.

04:23 Um, so yeah, I wanted to let you know that, and that's typically comes with these, uh, ghost roommate situations and just how they end up working out.

04:32 Great. Okay. So, um, I'm just thinking about my specialists, so they will be splitting that in half I'm. Um, and, but in terms of my expenses, um, in terms of, um, scientific cleaning laundry, they will do, they will do cleaning, but role and such.

04:56 Um, so in my clean for the common areas and they will do the laundry, I wouldn't have to write that at all.

05:03 Yeah. I'll confirm that. I think that should work for both of them. Um, I'll just have to confirm that with them and I can, I can let you know, And you said a thousand combined, So it'll likely be more than that.

05:15 I'm still finalizing the price and I can negotiate with them, but it will be more than a thousand. What we'll be able to come and see with you.

05:22 I think it'll probably be closer to 11 or 1200 for the month between both of them. Okay. Um, so, and you do, but I have to do, I do very odd interviews, um, with everyone.

05:40 Okay. And that's something you'd be interested in doing. We can also, um, we have, uh, we have our own vetting form and, uh, what we've done in the past, like if there was specific information that wasn't included in that form that you'd want, we can ask them for that as well.

05:55 Um, and then in the past, what done is, uh, we, we can host the interview between the guests and whether you'd want to do that, like at the same time or individually, we'd be happy to host that and, um, can set that up.

06:10 Um, okay. And in terms of duration, um, do they both have the same desire? Duration? Yeah. So that would be something that we'd want to, um, provide to you is have similar durations so that, um, you know, there isn't that uneven time where it's just part of the week for one of them.

06:31 And I know Greg had mentioned he was looking for, I think it would be, uh, three months if he was starting in December.

06:37 And I think Johann was looking for something similar as well, starting in December and going into, um, like sometime in February.

06:44 So I think it'll line up to where it will probably be close to like three to four months and that's to start and then, um, potentially like extending past that point as well.

06:57 Okay. Um, okay. Um, I am. And how does payment Scott? They pay you and you guys pay me. Yep. So we can release the payment to you.

07:09 And, um, typically like we've done it through, uh, Zelle, if there would be a way that you'd prefer, um, that can work, but yet payments come to us and then we release those payments to you.

07:21 And that typically happens as each day. I happen. So like, after the first night of each day, we'll compensate you for, um, for that person stay.

07:30 So for example, like after Monday night, uh, you would get compensation for Greg's, uh, stay, if that makes sense. Okay.

07:39 So like, like on a rolling basis, like something was not Okay. I am a little concerned maybe. Well, let me just say, are they both like fully vaccinated and like gotta be doing posters and all that.

07:55 I have the accent, but yeah. And I can get that. I can figure out that information, what I'll do, I'll give them the, um, it's just like a form that we have a vetting form and yeah, like that's a, that's a really great question.

08:05 Cause we, I don't think we have that included in the form right now, but like information like that I can very easily, um, I'd be happy to ask them and then share that with you.

08:15 So I'll write that down. Okay. I guess, are they all working hospitals and they won't require too and not just that, but they wear a mask all day at work.

08:28 So when they're home, they don't want to have to, I can imagine. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, what else? Um, um, and they, the, the address a lot, I don't know if he worked out already or spoke to them probably for location.

08:48 So they have, uh, we, we never share the exact address before the reservation. Um, they do know that they've seen like a map marker of your place, so they have a good idea of where it's at, but, uh, they, they went on with the exact address.

09:06 Uh, yeah. So Greg is, um, yeah, he's looking for a place to, uh, be in the city for during the week.

09:13 I think he had mentioned that he works, uh, an interior design or an interior design company, and then Johan similarly as well, uh, looking for a place in Brooklyn to be closer to her work for sort of the end of the week.

09:26 And I think she was looking to be closer to her. I think her brother, it was, um, during that time as well.

09:34 Yeah. So I am going to honestly say that I'm not adverse to this arrangement, but would have to be, and I have a room that I think might work, but well, I would figure that part out, but it would have to be closer to 1200 and I'll tell you why I don't like dealing with strangers is one thing.

09:56 And then the only way shoot strangers that change like another level of energy that, and often me, it'd just be like, okay, this is just, I understand.

10:09 And I want to let you know that where that that's a big part of our role as well as managing that relationship.

10:16 So the thing like, I know I had mentioned the managing of stored items is something that, um, we help go through me, it's do through our app as well as the cleanings.

10:26 So managing that part of it. I, I definitely want to let you know that, like, we, we play an active role in that and want to make sure that that's managed the relationship between both of them, which includes cleaning storage.

10:38 Uh, but I understand that having two people adds a little bit more complexity than just having one person at the space.

10:45 Uh, but with that said with our experience with ghosts roommates and working with these arrangements, we like to play an active role in like, um, I guess, fostering the relationship and making sure that things like cleaning, like storing things in the, in the check-in and check-out process, um, are managed well.

11:03 And even potentially, like what we've had in the past is guests, these ghost roommates form a relationship and it may become something where, uh, this would obviously have to go through, um, you and be agreed upon, but like maybe they share a night from time to time or are able to transfer a night if they have flexibility.

11:22 Um, but yeah, I just wanted to share that because I think I understand where you're coming from in that two people adds more complexity than just having one, Right.

11:34 Understanding that. Um, uh, and what are the ages of these individuals may ask? And I know that totally that's probably you don't, but I've had a young person one time and I'll say young, I mean, she was 21.

11:47 It was sweet, but how maturity, wasn't the thing? It's Like a monkey wrench in my whole, Yeah, they're both, uh, I believe Johann is 34 and then correct.

12:00 I believe he mentioned he was 28. I think it was so, both around 30. I see. Okay. That works. Um, okay.

12:10 Um, and get some sort of contracts or leases that would be, are you being like the intermediary vendor? Yep. And I, and I'd be happy to connect you, um, like with someone from our legal team or even our legal head, if you had specific questions about that, um, and how the contract would work.

12:31 But yeah, we, we hold the agreement and, um, would be basically sharing that with you guys when that time would come in and would show the agreement in this, in this case, it would be an agreement between, uh, yourself and then both of the guests.

12:46 She, um, um, would they be expecting like a clock of class door that will be locked by key locked or something like that?

12:58 That's something that I could talk that usually like a closet works in, in how we manage the storage is like by having pictures and basically records of what's being stored, um, just to, you know, have that peace of mind.

13:16 And usually like, this is all to prevent the worst case scenario. And most of the time, what we find is it's people just, you know, wanting a space, um, during their time in, they're happy to share storage if that's the case and just really have some things for, uh, uh, clothes and things like that.

13:33 But, um, yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll help manage that. And, um, uh, we have tools in place to do that as well.

13:42 Yeah. I don't, I just don't always think about the worst case. Yeah, no, no worries. And we want to help, help you be protected from that.

13:54 And like I said, we'd hate to see it happen, but don't want to be naive to that as either. So These guys like their primary, um, state or restaurants on the west coast, I think the boat, no, there, uh, Johann is from, um, Connecticut.

14:12 She's splitting her time basically between Connecticut and New York. And actually Greg might be the same. Let me actually check on that.

14:20 Yeah. And that's actually something we see, like even without, um, the ghost roommate situation, a lot of people, like a lot of, a lot of hybrid workers will be in Connecticut.

14:31 I think there's some tax advantages to that and being in Connecticut and then working in New York. Um, but a lot of times, you know, we say, yep, uh, Greg's from Connecticut as well.

14:42 So that's funny that actually both be coming from, from similar places. Okay. I might have thought, cause you guys are based on the west coast.

14:51 What would you say the west coast we're actually based in New York now? We're really only primarily primarily, uh, our listings are in New York.

15:01 We've, uh, helped guests in other places like Boston or Chicago, for example, but primarily New York actually. Okay. I have no idea like California.

15:12 Okay. Um, Hm. All right. And they just want to something like in December, so Yep. And you said just to confirm December 3rd was when that, uh, that specific room opened up, was that right?

15:26 Okay. Um, and that's, that room has a large really wash closet. So like that, that wouldn't be the ideal space for something like that.

15:42 Yeah. That would be great. Like pillows and things like that game, just like, yeah. Yeah. I think that would be, uh, that would be best.

15:58 And typically, um, the ghost roommates are sort of looking for that or they, they prefer that rather than needing to like share sheets or have them wash each time.

16:09 Um, yeah, it's just easier for them as well. Greg's male and Johan is female. Okay. Okay. So, okay. This is Yep.

16:27 And no, and always feel free. You can contact me whenever any of these questions. And in terms of, I'll be talking with both Yohan and Greg about some of the things we've talked about.

16:39 So I know you wanted to know, um, like vaccination, I can share our vetting form, um, with them, which will basically like get more general information about, um, like employment, um, the reason for coming and just give a little bit more of a profile regarding them.

16:56 Uh, and then also, uh, mentioned the laundry as well. I can bring that up and all that. I'll keep you updated on, on what they say on that.

17:08 Yeah. Final question for now is jeez. They would keep the keys each time they leave learning, Um, or what we've done as well as having like a lockbox, if that would be something that could work.

17:23 Um, I like an electronic lockbox where they could get the keys upon arrival. Yeah. If that, if that would be something that could work.

17:42 Okay. What about security? How do you, Uh, yeah, we can, we can collect security deposit and we would, uh, we would hold that and basically use that to, um, like mediate and make sure like, if anything was to happen or there was to be damaged to this space, we'd have that and be able to mediate that and immediate the relationship.

18:06 Okay. All right. Let me just put this out there. I don't know if I have availability right now. Okay. You might need a Coke.

18:14 It might have been 23, 11 28, 11 23.

18:33 Okay. And is that the same room or is that, that would be a different room, Um, in the area for the holidays.

18:43 I continue because you're now I think I may have it. Yeah. If you could, that'd be great, actually. Okay. So, um, oh, you gave me food for thought.

18:54 I'll just through a quick scenario. Great trucks and other data. Yep. On Monday, um, Greg trucks and Monday he would leave on Thursday then.

19:13 So we'd have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday night, Greg would be leaving Thursday, which would also be the same day, uh, Johan would be arriving.

19:21 So either on that Thursday or maybe Wednesday night, Greg, um, would do cleaning and you could even sometimes we'll have like cleaning checklists.

19:31 Um, it sorta just depends like, uh, what guests, uh, or what the ghost roommates, um, like find most comfortable to if, if they find that they can, can trust each other, then maybe the checklist, um, isn't needed.

19:46 But a lot of times, especially at the start, we can start with a checklist and make sure that just things are being, um, just an easier way to be like held accountable and, and what should be done.

19:58 And then Johann would come in on that Thursday, uh, and staying Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, and then checking out Sunday, um, yeah, typically, or similarly to, uh, to Greg doing the cleaning on, on that Sunday or Saturday night.

20:20 Very interesting concept. Um, but, um, and, and you said you have units in New York city that do this. Yes. The goals from situation For me.

20:31 Yeah. Yeah. And yep. I know this is, it is newer, so yeah. I want to be here. Um, if you have any questions and having these phone calls, I hope is helpful, but, um, yeah.

20:49 Anything, any, any questions don't hesitate to reach out to me? Um, I thank you for spelling your name. Cause once I spell it, I think That's great.

21:04 So today's deformity. Um, let me pull it over. I want to talk to my partner in this and you do this and only just like specific zip codes or it's just kind of, sort of when there's, well, you call me sporadically.

21:16 So I guess when this Yeah. So yeah, basically when there's interest in your place, um, we come to you with it and yeah.

21:25 Basically work it out with you in terms of if your space is available and sort of like what we're doing now, just sort of figuring out if this is something that can work.

21:34 Okay. And you said the rate, I can get closer to what would be top and cause I just, I think 11 to 1200 would be something what I can do.

21:47 I'll, I'm going to, I'll be negotiating with them and knowing that, um, you'll want a little bit more than a thousand is helpful to me and I'm going to I'll work to get the best, the best price for you.

22:00 And in terms of compensation using sort of their budgets and what they're willing to spend. Um, yeah. Uh, I'll do my best there.

22:10 So let's just also have a federal 1200, you know, each person will be doing 600. That would be in a mark.

22:18 That would be right in a week and three, three nights, Three nights In a month, that'd be 4, 12, 14, 15.

22:40 And if it would be, or for each person, uh, yeah. So yeah, and, and what we can, so we can do seven nights as well.

22:50 And uh, like, unless you'd be looking to put someone, put someone in that space for that one night, a week, it may be easier where we can do seven nights and, um, that may be helpful to Greg and Johan as well to have that flexibility like that, that Sunday night, I think is the one that isn't booked or maybe if they needed to come in on that Sunday night or they would find that useful, um, that would be helpful to them.

23:17 And especially if it wasn't going to be used anyway, or there was no plan to like rent that out for that one night, um, that could potentially be useful to them.

23:28 Yeah. We typically, um, onto one things like that, like on this, I'm looking at this and I'm just seeing some, some numbers, the worst had to be $40 a night.

23:39 And um, I want to just check them on rates, um, in the area because we literally easy basis usually like 42, but I want to just stole them or be searched because I accept that emotion.

23:53 I want to say it was sort of what is like a profitable number. Cause right now it was just barely breaking even, and only campaign, but you know, you gotta be pressured this now, like Yeah.

24:08 Yeah. So just to let you know my fault, but of course I understand they have their bottom line as well.

24:16 So you have a map that you guys saw when you were saying, Um, like a geographical map, A map with your listings.

24:26 Yep. If you can, and I can send you a link to our site, um, to make it easier, but if you just type in, um, www or yeah, you can just search slightly, so, and we'll come right up or WW dot, uh, split.lease and we'll, that'll take you right to our site as well.

24:41 Okay. Awesome. All right. So I'll just do a quick check to see what I see. Right. We'll talk in another few days.

24:49 Yeah, definitely. And if anything, anything comes up, any questions, like I said, feel free to reach out and I'll keep you updated as well.

24:55 Uh, in talking with Johan and Greg. Yeah. Individuals like them or other individuals who may not want to spend four weeks, but let's say three nights a week, weekly or monthly reconnect and be willing to pay what are the numbers.

25:13 So yeah, it can, it can vary based on like the type of space location, like typically, um, places like lower Manhattan for example, are, um, much more expensive.

25:24 Um, and then also the difference between room and, uh, entire space can vary. Um, yeah. I I'd hate to give you a number.

25:34 Like I think it really, it can really vary sometimes and even just the space itself, like really spaces that are, are nice and are furnished.

25:42 Um, we'll go for more than spaces that are not furnished, but then depending on location, I think it's a lot of different factors that contribute to that.

25:53 So for the pictures that I have, I have to send you a video. Uh, no, I don't believe I have a video of this.

26:03 Um, That'd be great. What is your email? <inaudible> lease reservations, inquiries. What is your email? My email, uh, you can reach me@bryantatleastsplit.com.

26:30 I can text that to you as well. T at least split L E a S E S P L I T.

26:49 Awesome. So I'm like a range I'm just able to see that on your side from your maps. All right. Thanks so much.

27:01 Yeah. I appreciate you talking with me and, um, having this conversation, this is really helpful. Yeah. Yeah. It really is for me.

27:09 And, you know, because I had a lot of things, but some things are just better and understood at least on my part with the conversation.

27:17 Yes, I can. I can definitely understand that. Yup. Yup. Have a great rest of the rest of your weekend. We'll see you.
