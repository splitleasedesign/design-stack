00:01 Please state your name after the tone. We'll try to connect you. Bryant.

00:22 Uh,

00:34 Okay. Yeah. Hey Herbert. This is Brian going to be talking with you. Good. How are you? Yeah, so I'd love to talk about the apartment and then answer any questions, um, for you if you had them, uh, as well as, yeah. Ask you some about the space.

00:57 The first thing I wanted to ask you about was the, uh, the rent and, uh, it says in the posting furnished or unfurnished with, is the rent that's listed. Is that listed for, uh, the space furnished?

01:14 Yes, It is. Okay. So 1575 for the month. And does that include, does that include utilities?

01:23 Yeah, all the utilities. Okay.

01:26 Okay. Got it. Um, and then another question, do you have a, a damage deposit for the space or a deposit they charge for,

01:38 Hey, you still there? Yeah.

01:42 Uh, about a deposit for the space, if you charged for one.

01:47 Yes, which is only one part.

02:01 Do you mind repeating that again? I think you cut out, um, you said there was a $200 fee?

02:08 Yes,

02:14 And the deposits 900. Okay, got it. Yeah. Um, uh, to tell you a little bit about me, so I know I mentioned Ariel and Amber, and these are two guests that came to us. Um, I work for a company called split lease and we matched Ariel and Amber as roommates.

02:33 And they're both kind of in a similar situation. They both have primary addresses in Connecticut, uh, but need to stay in Manhattan, um, for, uh, basically to be closer to their workspaces, both of them work in Manhattan. So we have, uh, our own lease agreement, uh, which we provide as well as, um, a supplemental agreement between ourselves and you as the landlord. And this is where we, um, match the deposit. So we would match the $900 deposit, which you charged for as well as guaranteed payments to you.

03:08 Uh, so in the case that a guest didn't make a payment or missed a payment. Um, you still get paid, uh, this is upon signing the lease agreement. So even if a payment is missed by the guests, do you still receive payment as the landlord?

03:23 Okay,

03:25 Great. Um, could I get your email? I'd be happy to send over some information. Um, and then if you, if you have any questions you can text me or email me as well. Um, both work.

03:39 Yeah. I'll text you my email details. You got API by me.

03:53 Okay. Uh, that sounds good, Herbert. Um, yeah, you can text me your email. Uh, you can expect an email from me shortly after this call. Um, I think that was about it.

04:04 Oh, maybe the other question. Uh, there's laundry in the building. Is that right? Okay, Andrea, and then, um, there's an attached garage. Is that, is that paid parking or is that, um,

04:24 Okay. Got it. Thank you. Um, yeah. Awesome. Sounds good. And let me know if you have any other questions, but uh, that's it for me. All right. You have a great rest of your day Herbert. We'll see you.
