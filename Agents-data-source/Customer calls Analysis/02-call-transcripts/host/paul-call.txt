00:36 Hey, is this Paul? Hello? Hey, this is Brian.

00:40 How are you? How can I help you?

00:42 I'm doing good. How are you doing? Good. Good, good. Yeah. So I had the, um, you reached out letting me know you had, um, some places available, um, about the split leased posts that I had on Craigslist. Is that right?

00:59 I am the landlord. So whoever emails you and you email back is just either, either a property manager or one of my staff workers. So briefly me in a little bit more so you can get acquainted with your situation.

01:11 Sure. Yeah. So basically, um, someone had reached out to a Craigslist posting. I had, um, basically working to for a split lease in Manhattan. Um, so yeah, so I, this is the company that I worked for, worked for them called split lease. And basically what I do is match roommates, um, and then find places for them to stay.

01:36 Uh, so that was what, uh, this posting was. So right now I'm working with a couple of different guests, um, Ariel and Amber are two roommates, which I've matched, um, who are looking for a place in Manhattan. Um, and yeah, basically,

01:52 Uh, I think I spoke to an aerial directly on Friday.

01:59 Uh, so basically they're, they're pretty flexible on location, but essentially they're just looking for a place, um, ideally in lower Manhattan, which the person who reached out to me said you may have a place on a one bedroom on east 25th.

02:17 Okay. Let me tell you a little bit about it so we can control, uh, all other apartments are fully renovated with stainless steel appliances, all that, however, that apartments that are you referring to the third floor, walk up like a railroad flat on, right? You remember what the kitchen is right there. And then the bedrooms and the one bedroom, the living room and the bathroom went to the Lang's it's normally going for 22 in change, instead of that's the only given that's not renovated, I can, what is their budget?

02:51 Um, so they haven't really specified a exact budget. I think 20, you said 2200. I, that would be something

03:01 That's renovated. It's a lot less than that. Got 17.

03:06 Yeah. I actually think that that would, that should work for them, I think.

03:11 All right. What'd you going to do is the following get ahold of them, um, have them contact me or set up a time cause I need to have, they just can't show up because we're not brokers. We're just landlords. I would have to either manager there or the Superbowl handles four or five buildings in that area need to just be, give them access to, they can see the apartment.

03:31 Yeah. So actually, so like I mentioned, they came to us originally individually and then, um, as split lease, what we do is, so they've both been vetted before Ariel, both Ariel and Amber, um, split lease has a custom rental agreement that we create for the roommates. And then there's a agreement between yourself as the landlord and the roommates, and then an agreement between yourself and split lease, which guarantees payments to you. Um,

04:02 Was it a little bit back what you just said? It's a little bit too complicated for me. What I do. Can I give, you can show them the apartment you'll need to run whatever the case they're going to pay you a finder's fee or a broker fee. That's up to you. I don't care. I'm only interested in getting a one month's rent and one security from them. Yeah, we'll be done if they see the unit and they like it. Standard procedures one month from security upfront, when they within it's a first month's rent, there's a background check and want to do all that. You're acting as the broker. Then that's your job. I haven't heard anything of that. Then I have to do it.

04:41 Whenever you get information back on checks, you do credit check, whatever it is you do, you do. I will piggy back on it and make sure everything is accurate.

04:51 We're not really doing credit checks, not because it's cold, but if you had astronomical credit back in February, 2020, chances are a month later, you had s****y credit because of what happened. However, it's one months, right? One security. If they see the unit and they like it, the only way I'll take it off the market is with a one month rent security deposit.

05:11 Got it. And then Go on your application. If you're going to charge them a fee, then you're doing all of the,

05:17 Yeah, really. The only thing I'd need from you is just, do you happen to have this place, like a link to this place somewhere basically where I could see additional information?

05:26 No, we used to have 16 people in our office. Now we have four people working for us.

05:32 Yep. Is this place listed somewhere? Are there, is there a link where I could see more information?

05:39 It does not. Okay. Um, so we don't allow guests to, we don't share addresses before booking, so we don't allow guests to see the place in person. So if there would be a way that I could get some information, maybe some pictures,

05:54 Normally this is what I do. You want to see? This is how I, this is how all this work on a house, subleasing, whatever. I don't know what it is. Could it be sketchy? It could be a scam, whatever you see them, you take them out, you have them fill out your disclosure form that they can come to me directly without you. They come and see it. If they like it, then they have to put down a cashier's check security deposit. That's how I work. If you want to work that way with me, it's fine. But this

06:20 I understand. Okay. Um, okay. I have,

06:23 I don't even know what subleasing means. I don't even know. I don't even know if you're licensed number one.

06:28 Yeah. What I, what I can, I'd be happy to send over some information too. If I could get your email, I can send, send some info over or a email to send that over to. And then the company's named split lease.

06:44 Yes. Okay. When you're splitting, what do you mean by split least?

06:48 Splitly so essentially the, um, like with the, like I mentioned, matching roommates, these are people that are using this space for like an Amber and Ariel's case each for part of the week, each week. So they're sharing the space, but they're not necessarily there at the same time. So the, basically

07:06 I'm not interested in that type of deal. Okay. Thank you.
