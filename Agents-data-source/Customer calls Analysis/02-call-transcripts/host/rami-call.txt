00:17 Good.

00:36 She lives a few blocks too, and she, uh, you know, she has a basement apartment. We both done, uh, like programs, hospitals. I'm not sure if you're a recruiter or not, or you help them.

00:47 So I actually work with a company called split lease and we basically match roommates, which is, um, what we did with Ariel and Amber. So they both came to us, uh, matched them as roommates, and now are looking for a space, uh, which is obviously why I'm reaching out to you. But, uh, yeah, the company is called split lease.

01:08 Nice. Um, so I'm a few blocks away. I'm on 1, 3, 2 Scribner, and I have a two bedroom apartment. Um, I guess I have some pictures and stuff. I can just send that to.

01:24 Um, or if you had a, like a link, if it, is it listed somewhere or

01:31 I think it was, but it wasn't, I don't think those pictures have furniture in them, so I can try to find you an old link where it will be when I was going to actually rent the apartment out. But then we started doing programs for like, I dunno, traveling nurses of America or something like that.

01:48 Yeah. Yeah. If he could, the link would definitely be helpful. And then, um, yeah, and maybe some updated pictures too would be, would be great. And this is a different, um, listing on the one that's on furnished finder.

02:00 So she's actually a, uh, maybe in our last week, so that's, which is that's willing to lay various. She did. So she does have like a, I guess, a studio type of basement apartment that maybe they, you see seen. So, um, as of right now, I, I believe in the last week she may have gotten somebody again from the hospital. Okay. We'll check with you or not, and I'll let you know if that's still Available.

02:28 That'd be great. I'll probably find out maybe an afternoon and I'll get in touch.
