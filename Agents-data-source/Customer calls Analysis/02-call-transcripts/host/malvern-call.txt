00:05 Hey, is this Malvern? Yes, it is. Okay. This is Brian. Good to be talking to you.

00:12 Good. I'm doing good. Yeah. Just wanted to hop on this call and clear anything up. Um, that then it makes sense. I know there was, it's kind of hard to get everything across Syntex, but, uh, basically the outline, the next steps. So, uh, like I was mentioning the information from the furnished finder listing, uh, will just be used to create the split lease listing. And, uh, so nothing should be like, there shouldn't be any differences from, uh, from the furnished finder listing there. And then once that's done, uh, I just send over a link to you basically where you can, uh, finish the creation of your account. So I'll have an account for you just with a temporary password.

01:02 Oh, hold on, hold on. I don't, I don't understand why and that listen to this to be creative. I have at least one punished grinder. I don't want, so I don't, I don't you say you ask them, but it was just in a rented space where Landon. Yep.

01:08 Okay. So what, so yeah, he should, you should listen. I've listened to many people prior before him, so I don't understand why, why wouldn't you listen somewhere else?

01:19 Yep. So, uh, Landon came to us, so, uh, I'm not sure if I mentioned, but I work for split lease and work as like a matchmaker, basically between hosts and guests. So Landon is someone who, uh, reached out to us and basically needed help finding the space. Like I described Monday to Friday. Uh, and that's specifically what we do, uh, at split leases either like part of the week, repeat, um, uh, reservations or part of the month repeat, uh, so like part of the week, each week or part of the month, each month. Uh, so in Landon's case, looking for Monday to Friday, he came to us looking for a space, uh, and showed interest in yours.

02:30 Anyway. Well, it's fine. I think it's getting too complicated.

02:41 Okay. Yeah. And in terms of the listing creation, it wouldn't be anything on, on your end and we do it this way. So, uh, we can just use basically the information, which you've already put up to furnish finder, um, and use that to create the listing that way. There's not, uh, anything for you.

02:55 Yeah. I don't want, I don't know, at least in created somewhat of website, I think, um, if you guys got insuring the listing on furnished finder, or like I said, since March 20, 20, I've went into, went into a bunch of people because I'm working from home and I'm barely here, so yeah. That's, that's fine.

03:21 Okay. So, uh, can I reach back out to then later today, I can just basically send you the information, um, that the, for the booking to happen for Landon to book, you would need to have your listing on a split at least. But like I mentioned, there would be nothing that you would have to do in terms of creating your listing or even creating your account.

03:41 No, that's fine, man. It's all good.

03:47 Okay. I mean, I'd be creating it for you. It just be sending.

03:57 Yeah. I didn't just want to have this in someplace else where, you know, it was just going to keep it, you know, so I called me again and he, he's fine. It's all good.

04:04 Okay. You're like Noah, your email or your phone number, wouldn't be seen by any guests and I'd be happy to manage the interest that comes in in a similar way where any interests that would come to your listing, I could come to you. And if you were interested, we could move forward. And if not, you just say the word and, um, basically that's, that's how it would go.

04:32 Yeah, well, you guys, you guys give it to me without me being on whatever that website is. Right. So, yeah. So my listening is where it is and that's where I just want it to be. I don't want it, put it on some other website where somebody else.

04:54 Landon. Okay. Uh, I'll I'll land in. Um, he wouldn't be able to book through furnish finder with what he'd want to do, but I understand if, if you wouldn't want to, uh, you don't want to be listed on split lease.

05:06 Thanks, man. All right. We'll see you.
