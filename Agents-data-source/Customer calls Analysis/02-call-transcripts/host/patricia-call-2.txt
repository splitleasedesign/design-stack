00:00 Okay. Yes, this is Brian going to be talking to you. Sorry. We have like six minutes to talk. I was getting an installer and it took forever anyway.

00:09 So you'll know your story. So are you still with that company? Yeah, so the company is called split lease, like I mentioned.

00:15 And then that's how I originally got connected with Ariel, or she came to us basically looking for Monday to Friday, each week.

00:23 And that's specifically what we specialize in is part of the week, each week or part of the month, each month.

00:30 Um, these like repeat, uh, part-time bookings. So, uh, and then from here I basically work essentially as like a matchmaker with guests and hosts.

00:39 Um, and yeah, that's sort of my side and I'm helping Ariel do that To be a nurse. Uh, she is not a nurse.

00:48 She works in banking, uh, in, in Manhattan. And, you know, I'm just a little very, cause there are so many scams around and I've already been scammed twice.

00:58 Yeah, no, I mean, I'd be happy to send you, um, like a link to our site and some other materials.

01:05 Uh, and then another thing I can do is, um, I can send you basically, uh, so we create a custom rental agreement and I can send that over to you as well, basically information just to show you, uh, how it would work.

01:20 Uh, cause I understand that you've only, you've only had a conversation with me through furnished finder and now talking with me over the phone, How would I be paid?

01:29 Uh, so payment would be, um, so we have basically, there's a rent rental agreement, which is between yourself and the guests.

01:38 And then there's a supplemental agreement, uh, between split lease and yourself and all payments. I think I mentioned this all payments are guaranteed to you.

01:47 Uh, so basically upon signing the signing of those, uh, documents, even in the case where like a guest had missed a payment or didn't make a payment, uh, you still get paid and that, and that comes from us slowly.

02:02 I have other properties in Florida. I actually have three rentals. I might be interested in doing something there. This is, this is my home, even though I'm not there, I'm in Florida just for notice about it.

02:15 Yeah. And also right now we are, um, we are based in New York city and only servicing in New York city. Um, if you could tell me a little bit about, uh, the space I saw that it was, um, like, so you live in the space as well, And this is my home, but I'm going to Florida for the winter.

02:34 So I do come up. I probably won't be up there until March and then that would probably be no more than a week.

02:39 So she wouldn't be sharing the space with me while my sister was, my sister comes up. That's one thing, the apartments, you just 1600 square feet, two bedroom, but I would not, she would not have access to my bed and mass, you don't run bit event.

02:51 Okay. The rest of the apartment and there's an outside, there's a chair, that's a doormat luxury building. Uh, because of COVID, that's another thing that building has a lot of restrictions.

03:02 They don't really like seeing strangers, you know, I've been in that apartment for my whole life. So, you know, they pay attention to people coming and growing.

03:11 That's another concern there. Yeah, it would be, uh, so you said like the maximum, it would just be one other person, like maybe yourself or your sister in the space.

03:24 Is that right? Okay. And then, sorry, I think I missed it. Uh, If it's not my sister and also could be my husband and I, John, if you have a wants to come, but it would be no more than two people in a space.

03:34 It's that she's only going to be there for three months, right? Yeah. And we're in March and April. That was what she was looking for.

03:40 Yeah. And starting when to hug, Um, she had mentioned basically around mid February. She said she has some flexibility right now.

03:49 She's basically just commuting to work. So she has some flexibility in when she can start. Um, but ideally she had mentioned like mid February Should be like two 15 to five 15.

04:01 Yeah. Potentially something like that. And I think on Shawnee Shriners is a solicitor at 1800, would there be any, and it was cause she's only staying five days.

04:09 Does she want a reduction or, Uh, so typically what we do is we do a, uh, there's a nightly rate, which is charged based on the number of nights.

04:18 They're there. I'm looking at your place right now. I believe in it's at 1700. Um, And, and another thing I'll mention, um, that we can do as well as what we call a ghost roommate match.

04:32 And typically this is something we'll only do in an entire space rather than a room. Um, but seeing as there's potentially one other person there, and it would be either like yourself or someone close to you like family.

04:45 Uh, and that would be where, um, like in this case, Ariel is looking for Monday to Friday, each week, and then we are able to match her with a ghost roommate, which would be someone who's coming, um, for Friday to Monday.

04:59 So they have Cause Too much traffic. I understand. Yeah. You said you're building restrictions. Um, yeah. And I understand it and typically it doesn't work out with, uh, with rooms and, um, I think this is still potentially something that could work.

05:12 You said 1700. Uh, this would be the monthly rate. Okay. Okay. And then there's a cleaning, you know, an extra cleaning fee and if she wants to clean while she's there, of course there's an additional Canaan.

05:27 You said if she, can you repeat that again, sir? Okay. And there's an exit claim fee of a hundred dollars, but if they're actually wants to have a claimed leave for some names of cleaners, she would have to have.

05:38 Okay. Yep. That makes sense. So clean. And then I see also there's um, an $850 deposit. Is that right? And also another thing we do, I'll mention, um, we match the deposit on the guest side as well.

05:55 Uh, so slightly so match that deposit and the case that, um, like it's needed to cover damages or, or anything that would happen.

06:03 In other words, you're saying damages a fan would be the 1700. Uh, yes. Yep. So 8, 8 50 coming from the guest and then eight 50 from slowly.

06:16 Oh wait. You know, I want to think about it. Send me the materials. I'm going to kick a number though, because my Florida apartment stuff, they're on call beach.

06:26 Yeah. Yes, definitely. Cause you, as your day on, I don't have any personal attachment. I don't have to worry about my building or any of that kind of.

06:34 Okay. Yeah. If I can just get your email, I'd be happy to send over some information. Yeah. It's Patrick P a T R I D L Y ali@gmail.com.

06:44 Oh, sorry. One more time. P a T R I like Patricia  P a T R I D O Y L E X email.

06:54 Got it. Yeah. To be straight. I'm a little nervous about my building because you know, it's a co-op and that the president or the co-op board lives next door to me and you know, they're, as I said, they're really very careful now, so I don't want any problems.

07:12 That's my concern with avenue. Yeah. And then the kid, it sounds like a, a ghost roommate match when it worked, but in the case of just a, like for instance, Ariel coming each week, um, yeah.

07:27 Th that's something that, that we can look at. Okay. I mean, how soon do I have to let you know, probably as soon as the better, right?

07:35 Yeah. Ideally the sooner, the better, I mean, I will say this is your space is in a really great location.

07:40 And like specifically, um, on the east side is where we see a lot of people that basically virtually the same as, as Ariel people looking for.

07:49 It's usually Monday to Friday, sometimes Monday to Thursday, each week, but people transitioning back to work, uh, who had moved out of the city.

07:56 So, um, and the kid, like Ariel's looking at other places as well, but in the case that this didn't work out, like I'd be happy to, uh, stay in contact with you and you have your, or you have my number.

08:08 Like you mentioned, you can always reach out to me with any questions or things like that. Okay. You're gonna send me that the company split space, right.

08:17 Split lease. Yep. I'll send you that information. I'll send that over to And I'll do it. You know, when I get it, I look at it and I'll decide another concern.

08:27 I have always Florida and I don't want to make a trip up there to, you know, to get area LA area.

08:33 And so I have to rely on getting a doorman to go up there and lock off my bedroom and bath.

08:39 So I, a little, because I don't want, I don't know. I don't want to leave that open. We can hold it.

08:47 Yeah. We can hold a spare set of keys as well. Um, and, and help in that process of blocking off the spaces that you want to, um, want to be accessed during, during this day.

08:57 Yeah. The only problem is my spare set up for them in New York and I'm in Florida, so that won't work this time, but that's really good to know.

09:05 Yeah. But what would you do? Send someone over? Yeah, we have, uh, we have people on the ground that we could, we can certainly do that.

09:13 Hello. Well, I think my doorman would be happy to do it. I'll just have to stand at him. All right.

09:18 Thank you so much. I know you had another appointment, so I'll let you go and I'll wait to receive the materials.

09:24 No, yeah, this is great. Thanks so much, Patricia. I'll send that over. And like I mentioned, um, reach out if you have any, any questions or anything like that for me.

09:31 All right. Thank you. Sounds good. Oh, one last thing I would get, like if we make a gentleman, it gets a security and her first month's rent right away.

09:38 My, Yes. So you'll get the first month's rent. Um, like the night after, or the day after the first night.

09:46 So there's a period where the guest is able to check in and basically verify that the space is completely different from what they saw.

09:55 And then yes, in that case, you, uh, we hold the, uh, the damage deposit, but the first month's payment is released to you after the first night.

10:04 Okay. Sounds good. Thanks very Much. You have a great rest of your day. Bye bye.
