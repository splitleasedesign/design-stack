NOTE: This transcript appears to be mislabeled. Nneka is actually the HOST, not the guest. Brad is her guest. This is a call about developing rescheduling features from the HOST perspective.

00:07 Hey, Nico. This is Bryant. Yeah, you can. No problem. We'll talk to you in a second. No, no worries. How are you doing?

00:32 Um, maybe a little, Okay. No worries. Yeah. Let me know if you can't hear me or anything. Okay. So I, like I mentioned, we've been working on this rescheduling tool and specifically working more on the traveler side, um, which is why I'd love to talk with you today and we'll be working on the host side of it and, uh, looking to improve that.

01:02 Um, so we could start maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how the rescheduling has happened thus far.

01:09 I know you guys have been, yeah, go ahead. No, I'm asking about, are we sending what, Uh, like how the rescheduling has happened between you and Brad so far?

01:23 Has that just been like through texts? Yeah. Um, so he was texting me and saying, Hey, you know, I can't make a fist for another day.

01:42 Um, I guess if it's, if I have availability That has happened. Um Yep. You said if you have availability. Okay.

02:00 Yeah. That's the frustrating part about none of the first thing I talked about it, like I had to go through you guys because our, as many, Well, you, you broke up there for a second Nika.

02:17 Could you, uh, you were talking about what was frustrating. He can trust you guys is this person. Yeah, I understand.

02:36 Um, for sure. And so you mentioned that your place, uh, being available is obviously one of the things which determines whether or not you're able to, um, like reschedule with Brad.

02:50 Is there anything else, any other information? Like, are you typically, I know you mentioned if it's available, you're typically allowing the, the dates to be moved.

03:00 Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm going to do Okay. Um, is it, I guess, what way would that change? You said you won't be doing that anymore.

03:16 No, because, um, you know, Brad and I had our contract ended in January or February, which keep in mind that that's just the year.

03:33 And so therefore it's not working financially to heat. I see. So the D the new dates are priced higher now in B.

03:47 And because Originally, when I originally, when I will see you there, there's no ass, I believe 1, 1 70, 1 75. And that was, you guys asked her about one from <inaudible> <inaudible>, therefore, I am not able to do that.

04:26 And yeah. And by providing him the flexibility, you're, you're not leaving the days available that were booked before that were that Brad wasn't able to make it.

04:36 I see what you're saying. And by pushing them back, it's, it's sort of taking days away that, um, were previously available, but because they're being rescheduled now, um, you're not able to book them.

04:50 Absolutely said there were supposed to move it there. Got it. Um, in terms of, uh, your availability, is that primarily, like, is, are you, when you talk about your listing availability is the only place you're getting bookings.

05:06 Airbnb. I have some of them today. If I worked <inaudible>, then it automatically updates on. Got it. What, and one thing we've been trying with a couple of our hosts right now, in terms of keeping their availability updated is just having, um, like you, the host send a screenshot of that availability, but I guess on Airbnb it's, um, the availability shows just on your listing.

05:44 Right. And you have access to my account. I tried to do some mission access to my accounts and stuff. You guys have the most up to date.

05:54 We can update that. Yeah, for sure. Um, that sounds great. Yeah. I'm glad. Is there anything else, like, um, worth mentioning in terms of the rescheduling process in terms of, uh, it seems like right now it's just been replacing dates.

06:10 Is that right? Like pushing Schedule? I'm not sure how that, um, I was spending on something, I guess I didn't have those, like the summer, like the November.

06:30 I think this falls to the four seals I looked through. I don't know if I missed it because I blocked off all of the dates from the beginning of the year to the end that the contract that I'm not sure how I did season number, besides that it was something like possibly on a biweekly basis.

06:52 I worked primarily Not going to just assume that it's by week by week. I'm not going to do that specifically.

07:03 Yeah. I understand what you're saying. Yeah. And that, that's something we can verify. Cause we had the initial booking with the dates.

07:12 Um, that's something we can check on too, but yeah, if it's unavailable then, um, and obviously it's not going to work out for, uh, for bread.

07:22 Um, another question which I had, which would be different, um, than rescheduling or, uh, replacing bookings. But if Brad was to add a book tonight, uh, and add instead of like replace, is that something that you would be open to and if so, would that be at a different rate And this quite, yeah.

07:45 I would be having different things to eat, but yeah, for the original, not with the <inaudible>, It would be, it would be a different rate.

07:58 Okay. That makes sense. Um, great. Yeah, I think I really, I just wanted to get a better understanding of sort of the decision and what information you're using.

08:10 It sounds like pretty much your listings availability and then as sort of like the primary decision-maker and then also, I mean, it's different when it's just being, when it's dates being replaced, as opposed to dates being added.

08:23 Um, but that's good to know that the listing availability is something that we can access and that we can, um, update and have.

08:32 And then in terms of getting requests, um, we'll be working on, uh, basically just having a way to notify you.

08:40 So you'll know when a request comes in and then from there you'd be able to, um, either like accept the request.

08:47 So you'd be able to see the request which Brad sent either for like a replacement or an addition. And then from there you'd be able to, um, like replacement would probably be a little bit simpler.

09:00 And then in addition, maybe we'd give you, um, like an opportunity to set a new nightly price or something like that.

09:07 And then also have the ability to message with Brad. I know you have his number as well, but, um, I'm assuming having some way, if there's like maybe one date that doesn't work having some way to talk with bread, I would be useful as well.

09:21 Oh, wow. Well, Was there anything else? Um, you know, I would just, I don't read on and it, so it was like, um, for the ultimate weekend thing, but do you guys not have like, So yeah.

10:02 Yeah. So we have a problem with, um, uh, so we've been checking on the listing availability and typically we're seeing a lot of like hybrid workers, for example, which would be able to work with Brad.

10:17 Um, but with some like listing available, like it would require a guest to have like Monday to Friday is a very popular usage pattern, which we see.

10:27 Um, so there can be some difficulties there in matching with your listing availability in that sense. Um, but we are, I'm continuing to market your listing in any, um, sort of offer.

10:41 Would it, would you prefer to me to come with you come to you with a guest? Um, even if it wouldn't work for your exact listing availability as it's displayed on Airbnb?

10:53 No, because I'm, <inaudible>, I'm not going to care hospital. That's funny. That's what I figured. Got it. Yeah. So there's, um, that's something that which could prevent it, um, prevent future guests.

11:11 Another thing which I can try to do is look farther into the future and, um, trying to find guests for, uh, like farther into the future so that the availability, um, problem is something that isn't as big of a deal.

11:27 I'm assuming January, February. Okay. That's good to know. Um, yeah, that's good to know. Thanks. Uh, and that's something I can keep in mind and hopefully, uh, especially with the beginning of the new year, we're finding, we're getting a lot of hybrid workers and people, um, who like know there'll be going back to the office, don't necessarily have a set end date on when there are for how long that'll be, but typically they know it'll be for two to three months.

12:03 And with someone like Brad's usage pattern, I think that would be a really great fit for your listening because they're typically looking for like really weeknights or weekdays, uh, each week.

12:17 Great. Okay. Uh, I really appreciate you taking the time Nika. This is really helpful. Um, I hope I can send you a, send you over something either later this week or next, um, to share with you on the app and basically, uh, give you a sense of like how, how it could work with, uh, rescheduling or adding, uh, dates in the future.

12:41 Um, and then I'd love to love to see what you think of that. Um, a lot of it will be based on the feedback and thoughts that you've given me here, sir, once again, I really appreciate it.

12:52 Thanks Nika. Have a good rest of your day.

BEHAVIORAL NOTES:

**Call Purpose:**
- Bryant gathering feedback on rescheduling tool development
- Working on traveler side, will work on host side next
- Wants to understand Nneka's decision-making process

**Current Rescheduling Process:**
- Brad texts Nneka directly for reschedules
- "I can't make it, can I do another day?"
- Nneka checks her availability manually
- Has been allowing rescheduling IF available

**Key Frustration - Pricing:**
L Original contract with Brad ended Jan/Feb
L Original rate: $1,170-$1,175/month
L New dates are priced higher seasonally
L By allowing free rescheduling at old rates, Nneka loses money
L "It's not working financially"

**Availability Management:**
- Primary booking source: Airbnb
- Uses calendar blocking across platforms
- Syncs automatically with other sites
- Split Lease has access to her account for availability
- Bryant suggests screenshots as backup

**Rescheduling Impact:**
  When Brad pushes dates back, previously available dates get blocked
  Nneka can't book those dates to others
  Creates opportunity cost

**Replacing vs Adding Dates:**
- **Replacing:** Brad swaps booked dates for different dates
- **Adding:** Brad books additional nights beyond original contract
- Nneka would charge DIFFERENT (higher) rate for additions
- Not willing to extend original pricing

**Proposed Tool Features:**
1. Notification system when request comes in
2. Ability to accept/reject requests
3. See request details (replacement vs addition)
4. Set new nightly price for additions
5. Message Brad within system
6. Replacement = simpler process
7. Addition = price negotiation needed

**Finding New Guests:**
L Nneka does NOT want guests who don't match her Airbnb availability
L "I'm not going to care [about mismatched availability]"
 Bryant should look farther into future (Jan/Feb availability better)
 Hybrid workers = good fit
 Weeknight/weekday guests = ideal for her listing

**Guest Pattern Preferences:**
- Monday-Friday = very popular pattern
- Brad's usage pattern = good fit for her space
- 2-3 month commitments = typical
- Hybrid workers returning to office = target market

**Contract Details:**
- Had contract with Brad (ended Jan/Feb)
- May have been biweekly bookings?
- Blocked off dates from contract period
- Uncertainty about exact November bookings

**Technology:**
- Bryant has access to Nneka's account
- Can update availability
- Working on app-based rescheduling tool
- Will send preview later this week or next

**Conversion Status (for rescheduling tool):**
 ENGAGED - Providing valuable feedback
 Willing to test new features
 Interested in solution that addresses pricing issue
  Frustrated with current free rescheduling approach

**Key Insights:**
1. Hosts lose money when guests reschedule at old seasonal rates
2. Opportunity cost of blocked dates is significant
3. Direct text rescheduling creates informal obligation
4. Need pricing flexibility in rescheduling tool
5. Replacing dates ` Adding dates (different pricing)

**Key Quote:**
"It's not working financially to [allow rescheduling at old rates]"

**Design Implications:**
- Tool must distinguish replace vs add
- Tool must allow seasonal pricing adjustments
- Tool must show availability clearly
- Tool needs messaging capability for negotiation
- Notification system critical for timely responses
