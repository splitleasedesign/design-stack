0:00:00 Hello. The Splitlease app. We are testing the website through your phone's browser. When using Vidyard, your video will stop at 30 minutes.
0:00:09 You need to start another one to finish the test. You must try all actions to finish the script. Using your phone's mobile browser, go to splitlease.net.
0:00:34 Sign up. On the site, create a new guest account. Sign up. Is it?
0:00:56 I guess isn't it just a new account? We don't want to sign a new guest account. That seems weird. Why do I have to use your special password?
0:01:27 I don't like you having access to anything I create. But whatever. I don't have my password in there yet. You should put guest after that.
0:02:02 Put new account and then select guest. This makes it, it'll make it less confusing. Use real phone numbers so that the texts come.
0:02:18 Cause they wouldn't normally come to a site. Okay. Post. 1, 2, 3, 4. Post.
0:02:31 1, 2, 3, 4. Okay. We're going to sign up. Great. Successfully created simulation page set up.
0:02:46 On a laptop or mobile. The page will be used throughout the test to simulate certain actions for the interested guests.
0:04:21 You will need to log in using the same credentials that you created on the site. Okay. You'll log in, double click when you log in, and you'll see the email page like this.
0:05:07 Current user, okay. After login, click the button that says Step 1 is registered as a usability test. Okay. Usability test, thank you for your mark yourself.
0:05:25 That didn't, That went away way too fast, I couldn't even read what that said. Reminder, all actions performed on the site itself should be executed on your phone and recorded.
0:05:39 To vidvid. Okay. Okay. Imagine your backstory you're a professional accountant and your firm just moved to his head office from LA to New York, your board, your bosses asked you to go there during the week and help the office set up and get everything in order.
0:06:00 Bye-bye. You have family in LA and want to return there weekly on Saturdays and Sundays. Your boss okayed the idea and asked you to find a place to stay in New York from Sunday through Thursday nights.
0:06:11 You're flying Sunday and leave Fridays after working for the next 22 weeks. You're looking for a place where you do not have to pay for the nights that you're not there, but still leave your stuff there.
0:06:24 Your friends tell you about the split lease and how they can help you achieve this goal. The new company headquarters are in the lower Manhattan area.
0:06:32 If you a split lease using your mobile phone, scroll through the site and figure out how to use it. You'll find it on Sundays.
0:06:48 What days would you like to return? You'll find it in the Friday and Sunday and through Thursday night and check out Friday.
0:07:14 Scroll through to figure out how to be the place for that suit.
0:07:30 That Explore Rental button doesn't work. Click here if you want a full-time rental. And that doesn't, these two buttons, that link doesn't work Die in a week, splits.
0:08:00 Explore Weeknight, Listings, for Entertainment, Explore Week, Explore Rentals, Explore Rentals, See if you can single out at least five places as your favorites to show your boss.
0:08:48 I like that one. That one. I like that one. Okay. Keep in mind you want to impress your boss, so look for places that will be close to your office and also be budget-friendly to get the best deals.
0:09:30 Can I search for that area?
0:10:03 I mean...
0:10:15 Yeah, these are all in Manhattan, so, That's fine. Pretend you had a discussion with your boss and he told you to choose the one you'd Okay.
0:10:33 So I talked to my boss, and he said, The one in Camps Bay. So let's go ahead and, Remove all these other favorite ones.
0:10:47 So we're going with the Thames Bay one. Please answer the questions below. What specific amenities? Where can we go look at this?
0:10:56 I just liked how it looked on the original. What specific features on this site do you think contributed to creating a joyful experience?
0:11:26 If you said, I don't know, stop reading and answer the questions. What would be really cool? Well, pretty much all you need here is just being able to filter by neighborhood and price.
0:11:40 And if you have that, that's all you really need on these sites. And maybe filter by ratings. Yeah, you'd want to filter by radians on here, too.
0:11:54 Because if you have a, I don't want to look at two-star radians. I want to see stuff like four. Or five stars or above.
0:12:02 Otherwise, I don't want to live there. I mean, this is annoying that I gotta do this from my phone, and I can't do this.
0:12:50 Just send this to my phone. I'm on the link above to open the list and see if you can submit a proposal to the host on a list that fits your schedule.
0:13:26 Oh, this one looks nice. Okay, so, yes. Submit the proposal, see if you can find where the- where you can view the proposal and what the status is.
0:13:44 Claim proposal. That little checkbox right here, do you have any requirements? That's funky. You have that left align instead of center align.
0:14:13 That looks horrible. Sunday, check out, Friday, move in, approximate, Saturday, total weeks, price, nighttimes. Okay, that all looks good.
0:14:51 Proposal created. Submit the proposal, see if you can find where the view proposals are. from your profile, you see my proposals.
0:15:22 Talk us through the proposal, how you understand the different elements. It's essentially telling you the check-in, check-out, and how much it's gonna cost.
0:15:47 And also check-in per week, and the duration of the, um, the stay. Posting details. It shows you the address, allows you to message the host, and shows you a map there, the map, the area of the, um, place, and the house rules.
0:16:12 Virtual meetings. Allows you to have a conference call with the owner. Proposal actions. Tells you that the proposal's still in review, has not been accepted in the status of the, um, proposal.
0:16:25 Where would I can, uh, your pictures and help you understand what is going on.
0:16:43 It's pretty straightforward. The only issue I had was creating an account on your, the top of your test case, and say create account, and then step two should have been create guest account from this whole app.
0:16:59 If you know Airbnb, it's simple. Rental application. Go back to the simulation page. and you show us the mobile experience.
0:17:13 I mean, where do we, I This is...
0:18:23 It tells me to go back to the simulation page, but it doesn't tell me how to answer the damn questions.
0:18:41 This will stimulate the host asking you to submit a rental application. You are keen to keep the ball rolling with your rental of this place as the trip is approaching.
0:18:47 See if you can find where to fill out the application and complete it. Split. Split leases preparing your documents. Go to this proposal.
0:19:26 Proposal actions. Lease documents.
0:19:37 See if you I mean, you should have that link in the messages, mate.
0:20:08 When you get that original message, it should tell you, click here to fill out your rental application. It should take you to that place inside the app.
0:20:19 Are there any other? Because I wasn't told in the app to go fill out my application. If your test case here didn't tell me to, I wouldn't have known how to do that.
0:20:29 No, just me. 15606, Creepside Drive, no.
0:20:45 How long have you been residing here? Three years.
0:21:15 If the host would like to see that you have income to afford this place, please provide your estimate now. Do you Do you have any reviews or reference?
0:22:28 Right here, that radio button right here is on top of the question. Fix that. And the second one, this whole page is, This whole page needs to be fixed.
0:22:43 I'm not sure if it looks better on the computer, but on my iPhone 13 Pro, it looks horrible. And when I hit yes to that question, it screws up everything.
0:23:02 Like, I can't, Yeah, this screen needs to be totally redone.
0:23:16 It looks horrible. My application has been submitted. Now I need to go check my time and make sure I don't...
0:24:19 ...lose my... Okay, I got five minutes left for this guy. So can I go back to the Schedule of Finance and change this?
0:24:50 You realize you have already submitted a proposal with your previous schedule and want to change it. So if you can find a way to contact a split agent and let them know you need help.
0:25:21 I see.
0:26:01 Instant live chat, and this is horrible, like, I can't see what I'm typing.
0:26:15 H-I-R-O-U-S-E-N-D-N-D-E-N Okay.
0:34:55 Oops, entering my date of birth.
0:37:21 and phone number, and password, okay, created that, and now we are opening Okay, using the same credentials again.
0:39:21 Continue. Okay. Scroll through the site and figure out how to view the places that will suit your schedule detailed about.
0:40:19 Let's see.
0:41:06 So if I'm at the top of the page, I'm going and selecting Thursday. Check in on Sunday, check out Thursday.
0:41:18 THURSDAY For the next 22 weeks.
0:41:30 You're looking for a place where you don't have to pay for the nights you are not there, but you can leave your stuff there.
0:42:01 Only pay for the nights you need six weeks to 52 weeks. I'm just going with Manhattan.
0:42:57 I don't know if it's Lower Eastside. Take a stab at that. See if you can single out how to list five places as favorites.
0:43:17 Okay. Budget-friendly, try to get the best deals. Okay. We're going to do a less than $200 a night.
0:43:38 Nah.
0:44:04 I'm going go back. So I hit the back button to explore rentals. They just did me an add-in. Check out Sunday through Thursday.
0:45:44 Explore. Manhattan, Neighborhoods. I have no idea. Okay, I'm opening the map.
0:46:47 Cut to...
0:47:30 Sundays. It keeps changing the date, the days. It keeps reselecting. I have to keep going back to the dates, re-entering.
0:48:19 I just want to change the price range. 2 to 350. The screen has gone blank. Completely.
0:48:48 So, we will go back to Explore Rentals again, re-enter, price range, going Beef 350 to 550.
0:49:22 100 a night, and there's no, there's nothing available, and the screen goes white again. So, if I just leave this open by day, Eastside, this is just giving me places everywhere.
0:50:47 Up here, hit map, and I see there's a heart, and I'm guessing that's favorite. And there's a place listed with no, ah, it's available in two weeks.
0:51:29 Oh, yeah, that's, yeah, I have to get, the new one should look like that too.
0:54:07 They're still there. What options would you add to the profile for each of them to make it more exciting?
0:54:21 Oh. Let's see where to find this. Go ahead, please.
0:54:33 Okay, we've got it. We're at Railroad at Conagir Pictures Hubs. What's going on? I don't know, but it seems like it was pretty straightforward to me.
0:54:57 I did miss the date, so I didn't change that, so that might be a thing that it showed and and I didn't really notice.
0:55:10 It'd be nice if we could switch the dates. Okay, so I need to go back to the stimulations I freaking hate this about seeing some.
0:55:56 Yeah, like, if you have, I, I don't know, I've noticed this, like, you know how on the Apple you would be able to see all that?
0:56:14 It's, you're talking about browser? Chrome on the Google phone? I haven't been able to do this for, ever, on my phone.
0:56:28 It just, like, every time I go to a new site, it, like, it closes it down. Well, that's what, because it's like Google, you know?
0:56:39 Hmm. Yeah, I'm still recording.
0:57:39 This will stimulate the host as he is met in rental application.
0:58:14 Rental application, oh, there it is.
0:58:25 Fill out a rental application. Okay. So we can fill out a payment. Okay. That's my phone number, I'm going to do it very, very fast, and I'm going step out.
0:58:42 Did you receive any communication messages against this And no occupants did, as you know.
0:59:22 Um, 241, uh, what is that, huh? 34, Horace Street, Sill Beach, California, 235, let's see what's my phone I'll try not to do that.
1:00:41 Uh, okay. Hmm, interesting. Perfect, okay.
1:01:05 Okay, next. Do you travel with a pad now? Are you a smoker now? Do you have any reviews that you've seen in the past?
1:01:13 Yeah, uh, no. Yeah, okay. Gosh darn it, puppy.
1:01:31 Okay, did you receive my application? Yep, your boss has changed your requirements See if we can find a way.
1:01:52 But then I need help. This proposal. I don't know if I posted this in the details.
1:02:13 Edit. 22 weeks, I can fix that. the other one it's going to be tuesday today's friday today is the Why?
1:03:27 Can you change the terms to suit your schedule by yourself? No. You feel that it's Easy enough to make contact, split base agent, cellulose agent, uh sure, can change the dates.
1:04:05 Okay. Okay. Realize your host will look at your profile.
1:05:33 What options? Okay. I think it'll, you know, hmm.
1:06:08 Okay. Um, June. And the passwords you are now at are listed.
1:06:32 Okay. Oh, that's cool.
1:06:46 Clones. Oh, cool. I really like how you can select from the list. That's cool. Um.
1:07:02 Yeah. Okay. I think that's good. Alright. Um. We're going to go back to the stimulation page. Notification settings. Oh, cool.
1:08:04 Okay. Notifications. I think it would be under MyPipeline. Notification settings. Okay.
1:08:31 Change at least one set. Okay. Okay. Pretend to scroll through the site again and find the listing. What looks like, What is this proposal?
1:09:34 Okay, it's completed. See details. You can see the price breakdown. Uhm, okay.
1:09:53 What options... And would you like to add to the notifications that we use? Notification settings. I think they're all there.
1:10:08 I can't think of anything else. Maybe it, oh, uhm, if a message comes in, it will pop up on your phone.
1:10:16 That would be good, I think. You should fill, you should fill, you should fill. Okay. And then I'm going to copy this into there, and then I'm going to find the file.
1:10:42 And Put this on. This is where I want it. Click on Okay. Uh, so apparently, Don't have the right, link in here.
1:12:07 Let's see what else... Okay, copy. Okay, I have a link over now, so we're going to edit.
1:12:45 Okay, let's do it. Uh, I'm going do a translinks. select proposal.
1:13:00 Back on the simulations page. Virtual Editor. back to estimate this will stimulate the host see if you can find notification of the virtual confirm it times Okay, I can change the functioning of the site.
1:14:10 Okay, I'm Mr. E. Okay, back to the simulation.
1:14:21 Okay.
1:14:43 Uh, did you get any leasing information on that?
1:15:02 Okay, I think that's it. When you're on the type thing. And there's the student. Okay, Uhm.
1:15:37 Okay, okay, Create. Which you're going to hover over, yes. Now that you have completed your test, stop recording.
1:15:57 Okay. Now I'm going to sign up for a new, uh, split lease.
1:20:53 Actually, I need to open it with this link, so.
1:21:36 Not sure how to send this to my phone. And I guess I'll just, Let's put that list first. Let's do that first.
1:22:48 Okay.
1:23:30 It says sign up as a guest. Okay, I'm a little confused.
1:24:17 Looks like I'm still on the home page. Oh, I'm logged in. Okay, so I'm logged in. I was just a little confused because it looks like the same home screen as before I signed up.
1:24:29 Except that I think the sign up and sign in button Okay, did I get a text? Nope, no text. I'll just mark these as red so that anything that comes in will be related to this test.
1:24:47 So, okay. Now let's go to this URL again, which I think I have open here.
1:25:23 Current user, yep, current user is my email. Click the button that says Step A. Okay. Report your phone to be accounted for.
1:25:43 Okay, you're a professional accountant. Okay, so I'm moving to New York, family in L.A., need to stay in New York from Sunday to Thursday, flying on Sundays and leave Friday after work.
1:26:03 Work for the next one, two weeks. Friend tells you about Splitlease, a new company in Manhattan, back on Splitlease using a mobile phone.
1:26:16 Okay. Scroll through the site and figure out how to view the places that suit your schedule, detailed above. Okay, so I see Explore Rentals, so I assume that it's just really quick, weeknight listings, weekend listings.
1:26:40 So I'm basically looking for Sunday rentals. Sunday night plus weekday. I want to return on. So I'm staying from, can you find a place to stay from Sunday night to Thursday night?
1:27:05 Okay, so I don't need a place to stay on Friday. when you place this down Sunday. Okay so I'll click Explore Rentals then.
1:27:22 Companies and Lower Manhattan. No, there's a lower neighborhood called Lower Manhattan. I don't know what constitutes Lower Manhattan since this is all Manhattan as far as I know.
1:28:09 Uhm, it looks like maybe, let's say, like, East Village or SoHo or whatever this area is down here. They all look like potentially good options.
1:28:28 Okay, but this is the area I want to be in. Oh, okay, so this is the Lower Manhattan here. But it doesn't show up in the filters in the neighborhoods, so I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna leave it for now and then I'll just check it on the map as I scroll through.
1:28:58 Okay, so I want to stay from Sunday through Thursday, so I'm assuming this is how it works for 22 weeks.
1:29:17 Do I have a price range? Nope, no price range. Pressure box, closer office, budget friendly.
1:29:30 Ooh, so okay, so I am, I do care about, do care about price. Let's see if I can get a cheap one.
1:30:03 Manhattan, New York. And this is, looks too far, I think.
1:30:21 Yeah, this looks too far. How do I move this with my fingers? But how is this moving?
1:30:36 Do I have to just keep selecting stuff? Like I can't scroll with fingers. Two fingers doesn't work, one finger doesn't work.
1:30:48 Only if I click symbols, then I can move. Yeah, but this is definitely not lower, so maybe I can choose a couple neighborhoods.
1:30:59 Let's say, like, I saw earlier. here. What was it? What did I see here? I think East Village. Yeah, see this map moves.
1:31:19 The other map should move as well. East Village looks interesting. Tribeca, Lower Manhattan. It's a little hard to tell what areas I'm interested in.
1:31:29 Seaport. Uh, just zooming in and out to see if I can find any neighborhood names, because I'm not very familiar with them.
1:31:40 Tribeca looks good, too. Chinatown. Okay, let's try. Oh sure, we'll put East Village in.
1:31:58 I think it's called Financial District, the most bottom area. Uh.
1:32:19 Is it Lower East Side? Feels like Lower East Side is part of it. Oh, there we go, I saw it.
1:32:29 I did see Lower East Side. I saw any of these other ones. Let's see if I can, Ooh, East Village is kind of far, actually.
1:32:57 Two bridges, Well, we can tell by clicking one.
1:33:33 So, where is East Village? Oh, cannot scroll again, so, Okay, so it's not that far from Lower Manhattan, but it is not the closest.
1:33:53 I wonder why Tribeca and Chinatown aren't selectable in the list of neighborhoods. or Laura Manhattan directly. Okay, so, we'll take out East Village.
1:34:07 No, Tribeca. Alright, well, let's try this one.
1:34:19 Civic Center. Okay, so, Civic might be too far south.
1:34:54 Do I have a Soho, Chinatown, or Hudson Square? No Soho. No Chinatown. No Hudson.
1:35:15 A lot of options. I didn't see Nalila either. I wonder if Noho's closer. I wish there was a way to draw a bounding box.
1:35:41 Like, hey, I just want, I just want somewhere here and just draw it in a circle, like, with my finger.
1:35:49 Uh, but let's see. Okay. I mean, honestly, I probably do. Let's see, East Village again.
1:36:16 Oh my god, why does it keep doing It's about the same distance as Financial. Noho's closer. I don't have Soho.
1:36:31 Wait, uh, I think it reset.
1:37:04 Refreshing. Refreshing just reset all the, all the filters. Yeah, it's back north. Oh boy. Okay, let's do this again.
1:37:20 So I want, I think Noho's interesting. Thank you. Uh, Lower East Side, Financial Problems, Cheapest, I think this would be the spot.
1:37:36 Oh, I can't Why can't I click on the images? This is weird. Okay, well, I do need Wi-Fi, that's really important, so that's good.
1:38:17 Oh, this is, like, north now, huh? MTA, so I think that means public transport would be easy. Not a favorite.
1:38:47 This is in Yeah, it's within throwing distance of Lower Manhattan, so I will also add this one.
1:39:40 And this is, I believe, the same building, so I will also favorite this one. Yep, same Now I need two more so that means that I need to widen my search.
1:40:03 Okay, here we go again. Let's try a Civic Center. And Financial, and, What did I do?
1:40:22 Really know how. We'll just do East Village and then don't have any other options. So I did those two. Those three are favorited.
1:40:37 Oh. Now that's that's really bad UI where if I refresh the, everything disappears in terms of the filters. Filters really should be staying there on a pull-down refresh, especially if it's an accidental refresh.
1:41:01 Okay, so adding stuff back. Oh, select fewer items. It's not gonna Okay, so I have to look farther away. I'm actually just going to look at the lowest priced ones based off the map.
1:41:27 So I got those two. There's three in this area. I think I have this one. Wait, no, I don't. And I can't see them anymore.
1:43:10 Okay, I favored that one. This will be the fifth one So, now that I know that, I probably would just use the, uh, Why is it doing that?
1:43:34 I think there's a bug. I don't know what's going on with this, Well, if I had to take a guess, this one looks to be in the same area.
1:44:27 Similar pricing, so I'll just do that as the fifth one. Oh, let me check where Clinton is. Okay, those should be the closest ones.
1:44:58 Because based off the map, there's, uhm, there's twelve up here, but we don't want the farthest ones. We want to be on the lower end, so there's three down here, two up here, and that should be it.
1:45:19 I think it would have been, okay, so, like, for this question, what elements are featured in the map, have greatly contributed, I think if I pull down to refresh, it'd be nice if the filters didn't reset.
1:45:30 Because right now, if I do this, right, and I pull down, once this loads, it resets all of the filters, which really sucks.
1:45:46 It'd be nice if this map was viewable, and also, we could draw a bounding box, like, hey, I just want find things in this area, see what comes up, or be able to search within a mile distance, like a distance of like five miles or something like that.
1:46:02 That'd be super helpful. It'd kind of be cool, too, if we selected neighborhoods, for those neighborhoods to be highlighted on the map, so I could see where actually Clinton is searching, as I'm, like, clicking these, so I have a better idea of, I'm missing a neighborhood that I actually do want, or
1:46:22 not. It'd also be great to have a map view when, uh, we're on one of these pages. so having this map view I should be able to be scrollable right now you can't pan left or right so yeah I think also because it's resetting my the weekly schedule kept resetting for me I didn't always notice that but when
1:46:57 the weekly schedule resets from like a pulldown that also kind of throws things off a bit okay so I'm gonna email this to myself so yeah I mean I basically would just go back to my boss and go to my favorite listings I should have five I want those five two three four five okay cool and I I basically
1:47:57 want to create a proposal for these five homes. Probably I'd, the Civic Center ones look nice or this East Village one right here which is probably what I'd go with.
1:48:11 Um, since I'm trying to optimize for price I'd probably go with this East Village one. 167 per night is definitely the cheapest.
1:48:20 Uh, let's And then change the schedule which just keeps resetting. Okay, there you go.
1:48:43 This based off the price. It looks decent too. Like the Medis are basic and look small but looks like you got everything you need.
1:48:55 Looks pretty updated in parts of the home. Um, okay, now let's talk about just creating a proposal.
1:49:06 Let me send this to myself. I'll just send it via I'm gonna open it up in Slack for myself.
1:49:33 Uh, what did I send myself? Thanks for watching!
2:24:05 Okay, I'm back. Um, we're going to try this again, see if we can get through this, uh, this whole thing.
2:24:18 So, um, let's see. I'll explore rentals here. Easy to scroll through here and see the, uh, the different, um, tiles that show the, uh, the place with pictures and how much per night.
2:24:52 Uh, it looks great. I, I like this, this setup. It's really good. Um, I, I think the, um, uh, because I'm not familiar with, uh, with the Manhattan area, I'm not sure which ones to pick here, but I'm going to just pick a few at random here, uh, that, that look good and, uh, have a good rate here.
2:25:14 Let's see, this one's in Harlem, Upper East Side. Let's go with, let's pick like five of them here. Pretty good.
2:25:38 Three. Okay. Let's go with those. So, let's see what, uh, what this looks like here. Oops. Okay. Now I'm going to go back to the original screen here.
2:26:01 Yeah, it looks, it looks easy to, uh, to get around. It's opening up some new windows here.
2:26:20 Okay. So. Okay, it looks like we had a discussion with my boss and specific elements.
2:26:33 It's… Yeah, again, I think that the… I don't see an icon here that will just isolate the… the favorites that I selected.
2:26:46 Uhm, I don't, I don't see anything here at the top. Maybe it's in filters. Okay, no. Yeah, uhm, it would be nice to have an icon or something that just isolates those favorites that you just selected.
2:27:07 So, that was one, that was one thing. That would be really cool. Oh, let's see. That's the only thing that was missing, really, scrolling through the site like this.
2:27:21 I mean, you know, to view a map is really cool. You know, to see where exactly that, uhm, location is so that I can see how close it is to, uhm, to where I need to be each day at the new office.
2:27:36 Uhm, okay. I like the, I like the fact that it has a place where you can message.
2:27:47 Uhm, so, and, uh, we're gonna and take a look at the, at the one that looks good here.
2:28:12 Okay. So, I want to submit a proposal here. And this is great. Shows all the things that are before we grant.
2:28:31 Okay, at the bottom, proposal, create a proposal at $117 per night, I'm going to select that. What do you want in the space, okay, and fill that out.
2:28:42 Testing the site, let's see, that's a something about myself here. Okay, I want to leave belongings. Okay. So, there's create proposal.
2:28:52 I, I don't see anything, uhm, on, on where it says create proposal to actually submit it. I'm, I'm, I must be missing something here or, or my phone.
2:29:03 I have an iPhone, uh, 14 Pro Max. Uhm, it's not, it's not allowing me in this window. It just, the only selection is say, tell us more and there's there's nothing else there to create the proposal.
2:29:19 So I'm not I'm not sure how I'm supposed to create a proposal. I've I've I've filled it out. I put something in all the fields, even tried to say, do you have any unique requirements?
2:29:33 I put something in there, but there's, there's nothing on, on the site that I'm seeing that I can, uhm, select to submit that proposal.
2:29:46 So that's something that's missing, missing, I think, in, in the, uhm, in the app. Uhm, I'm, I don't know if I'm, I'm missing something here.
2:29:56 Create proposal, every time I go into that, all it gives me, the only, the only selection it gives me is two.
2:30:05 Tell us more, it doesn't say submit proposal, or, you know, this is just to create that, I don't know if I need to go somewhere else, if I'm missing something in the notes here, uhm, okay, uhm, not, not allow, allowing me to, to, to, uhm, select, uh, step B, uh, so I'm not sure, heh, what the next step
2:30:42 is, uhm. Uh, yeah, I'd like, like to answer these questions, and, uh, and, and, and move on, but, uhm, I am not seeing anything here, uh, let's see, let me, let me take a look here at other, other icons, maybe, that might show that I can submit a proposal.
2:31:13 So, description, amenities, building neighborhood safety features, house rules, description of neighborhood, map, reviews, that's great. I love that. That's, that's, that's really good.
2:31:28 Uhm, I'd like to see, I'd like to see reviews like that. Uhm, uh, nights, summer nights, week two, uh, thirteen, wait, okay.
2:31:35 Uh, click to message, but then, yeah, if I create a proposal, it's just, it's missing that submit button to create it.
2:31:50 I've put everything in the fields here, but I'm just not seeing anything that says Submit Proposal. So that's something that's missing in the app.
2:32:04 I'm not able to go any farther. So, uhm, if, if you'd like me to try this again after there's something in the test app or in the test, uhm, environment that has a button in here, I can go ahead and complete it.
2:32:21 Uhm, but other than that, it's great. I think it's, I think it's a great app. It's, it seems like it's easy to get around.
2:32:29 Uhm, again, you know, nothing to click in the proposal, uhm, and also, So, if there's an icon that shows that when you select it, select, uh, favorites, uhm, if you could show, isolate just the favorites that you selected so that you have just that list to look through, that would be a good thing.
2:32:56 But, uh, other than that, I think this is a, that's a great, it's a great app. I mean, if, if I were, if I were in need of it, I would use it.
2:33:05 So, thanks again, and let me know if you need me to do this again once that selection's there and I can finish this.
2:33:18 Thank you very much. I'm not familiar with the Manhattan area.
2:57:35 What specific elements or features on this site do you think would have contributed to creating a joyful experience?
3:01:40 Well, I think the, uhm, uh, access to the map, uhm, uh, actually going through, uhm, the, uhm, photos of the place, uhm, uh, that, that, uh, Because a picture is worth a thousand words, of course, you know, and it's easy to get through those photos to see what the place looks like.
3:02:06 Functions would be really cool. Wow, uhm, covering everything here. I mean, I'm, I'm, you know, you can, you can hit, uh, favorites, uhm, maybe, uhm, a way to, to get to your list of favorites.
3:02:27 Maybe I'm not seeing them, but, uh, a way to get to the list of favorites pretty quickly once you've selected them just to show the favorites by themselves.
3:02:36 Let's see here. Filters, I don't see that anywhere, where you can just look at your favorites. Let's see. Okay, it's showing all the places there.
3:03:02 I don't know. I mean, it's pretty, it's pretty good. I mean, the summaries of each, of each, uh, tile, uh, with the pictures in the top is, is great.
3:03:10 the person who shows a picture of the person who's leasing it out, then you can message them rather quickly. But yeah, I think seeing a list of those favorites by themselves, uhm, uh, very easily.
3:03:32 Something at the top of the, uhm, of the site, or you can say, where, where you're, you just click on it to list your favorites.
3:03:41 Maybe that would be good. So, okay, let's see what this looks like here. Let's see, we found this one. Oh, sorry, didn't see that.
3:04:15 Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. Let's see what else.
3:06:52 Okay, let's just get this unified out of the protocol.
3:08:46 Create proposal. Not able the proposal. This gives me, tell me more, tell us more. Let's see here. Okay, I don't see anything on, on, on, uh, submitting the proposal.
3:09:55 So, I'm not sure if that's submitted or not. Okay, see if you can find where you can view the proposal and what the status is.
3:10:06 Not able to see that either. Okay. Yeah, I understand, uhm, the different elements in the proposal, but, uhm, I'm not able to actually see it anywhere else.
3:10:31 Sorry about that. Where would iconography or pictures have helped you understand what is going on?
3:10:46 Uh, icons, uhm, maybe an icon for the proposal that was submitted that I could click on?
3:10:59 Uhm, don't know. This is, I mean, I love the overall look of the app and everything. It looks like it's going to be pretty easy to use.
3:11:12 But yeah, like I said, I wasn't able to submit the proposal and see where the proposal is just to review it.
3:11:23 Okay, back in the simulations page. It's at step B. It's here. Okay. Go ahead and click the button that says step B.
3:11:34 Okay. I'm at 27 minutes right now. And, uhm, yeah. Well, not over 40 minutes, so.
3:14:46 find the functionality. Okay. You need to be signed in if you're on this Okay. Cool. Where is it at? Biography.
3:29:27 Hi, it's me again. And, let's see here, we're going to start doing this, start doing this test again. So, instructions.
3:30:07 Okay. Alright. And I've, uh, selected, uhm, five different, uh, favorites here.
3:31:11 Okay. What specific elements or features on the site do you think would have contributed to creating a joyful experience? Uhm, I think, uh, a, an icon up here to show favorites.
3:31:23 I think I think I can get to those favorites. Here. Just to isolate those. Maybe an icon where I wouldn't have to go into my profile to do that.
3:31:42 There's a few favorites that I clicked on in here. Okay. Uh, what was missing for you during your experience of scrolling through the site?
3:31:55 Really nothing other than that icon maybe at the top that would have been really cool. The tiles here look very informative.
3:32:09 Show bullet points. It's great. It shows a map. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, this is great. I mean, I don't think there would be anything that I would, um, add.
3:32:29 Maybe down at the bottom here, an icon for those favorites. I don't know. Something like that where you can get to the favorites pretty quickly.
3:32:41 Okay. Going to sending the link by email so I can open that one up.
3:33:27 Uhm, on my phone. Submitted a proposal. Uhm, view the proposal and what the status is.
3:34:53 Okay. Trying to find out where I can view the proposal and what the status is. Proposals. Okay. This is one.
3:35:41 Shows the schedule. Shows, uh, post and listing details, virtual meetings, uh, status and more actions.
3:35:54 Okay. Found that. See where you can find a proposal. Okay, it talks us through the proposal. How do you understand the different elements?
3:36:03 Yeah, I understand all the different elements and how the drop-down list works. It lists on each, so that's, that's fairly simple there.
3:36:11 Okay. Uh, where would iconography or pictures have helped you understand what's going on? Hmm Maybe maybe some icons just like like the favorites icon maybe somewhere rather than having to go into The list in my profile there or on my Photo there.
3:36:42 I mean that's fine. I had to kind of guess where that list is to get to my proposals or my favorites or or whatever.
3:36:52 I don't know if that's something that can be done to make it easier for someone to find it quicker than that without having to go through maybe a tutorial and saying, hey you have to click on your picture to get to those things.
3:37:05 So that's just a suggestion. Okay, back on the simulations page, go ahead and click the button that says Step B.
3:37:16 Okay. Okay. Let's see if I can make this smaller.
3:38:20 A couple more tasks. Start a new one. Okay. Rental applications. Okay. Simulations page. Okay. Uh, click the button that says Step B.
3:38:50 Simulation page. Add. Okay. The Simulations page. Uhm, hmm, Simulate the host ask, asking you to submit a rental application.

3:45:34 Okay. And move in day and check in mismatch. Move in day and check in mismatch. Okay. Tuesday maybe go here okay update proposal okay yes I was able to update the proposal Realize the host will look at your profile determine whether you're a good suit for their listing see if you can find the spot where
3:46:19 you can add some details and profile to edit it. Okay. My profile try and create a profile that really would be a better chance as a host of accepting your profile.
3:46:39 Okay. And then biography. And so forth. Okay. That's how I could change it. And let's see. Profile progress, 75%.
3:47:14 Okay, where am I? I'm missing something here. Verify the phone number. Verify the, okay. Verify identity. All right. It's like there's no, there's no save action on this page.
3:47:32 I think it just, uh, I'm assuming it just saves when it, um, when I, when I leave that, that it saves when I make the changes.
3:47:42 What options would you add to the profile creation editing to make it more exciting? To make it more exciting.
3:47:59 I don't know. It looks pretty exciting to me. I don't have any suggestions on, on changing the, the, adding a profile.
3:48:15 Um, it's pretty, it's pretty straightforward. um, the only thing I could think of is maybe you want to do a, a video in there instead of just a photo.
3:48:29 Maybe that'll make it more exciting. I don't know. Okay. Uh, okay. Step C. Okay, proposal being accepted by the host, see if you can find the accepted proposal.
3:48:47 Accept the proposal again and talk us through to understand from the status of the current proposal. Okay. There it is.
3:48:52 Okay. All right. And. Post says, yep, okay, we've got them. Yeah.
3:49:46 I'm using the mobile to test it, so. Okay. Yes, I do understand where in the process I am now and what the next step should be.
3:50:02 Still busy. Okay. Change at least one setting to enable you to react to different notifications quicker, should a host try and make contact, okay.
3:50:24 We find the notification settings, okay. And the site notification settings.
3:50:38 Okay, see if you can find where on the site you would find the notification settings.
3:51:00 Notification settings all right Notification settings.
3:51:41 Weeks of the month split, explore rentals, popular listings, notification settings. Let's see, notification settings. Browse frequently If you have any questions, please contact Is it under my profile?

3:52:58 So, okay, change one, okay. By phone, SMS, Reservation Updates, okay. Update, tap here to continue, okay. Tapping here to continue, nothing's happening there, okay.
3:53:17 What options would you add to the notification settings? Let's see, reservation updates, reservation requests, check-in, check-out. Transaction info, reservation issues, hmm, phone or SMS.
3:53:38 I, I would think, um, just a section that said, how do you want to be notified, phone or text, and then a list that says, what do you want to be notified about, rather than doing two different things on the phone.
3:53:59 One for one list for phone, one list for text. You could say SMS. A lot of people know what that is, but some people don't.
3:54:07 Wouldn't make it simpler to say text or phone. Which one would you like, or both, and then a list of the check marks.
3:54:17 Do that. Um, okay. Create more proposals. Uh, you feel you should have a backup plan just in case something goes wrong with the first rental, so you start looking for second plan find this listing okay click on the above link to open the listing submit a proposal this place as well using your new schedule
