COLD START THEORY

The Framework
The central framework described in this book is a new way to think about network effects--split into stages, each with its own distinct challenges, goals, and best practices. My goal is not simply to describe what happens as a network grows and evolves, but to describe how to actually take action and propel a product from one stage to the other.
I call this framework Cold Start Theory, named for the first and most important stage in building network effects.
Cold Start Theory lays out a series of stages that every product team must traverse to fully harness the power of network effects. The curve represents the value of the network as it builds over time, and is shaped as an S-c urve with a droop at the end.
There are five primary stages:
1. The Cold Start Problem 2. Tipping Point 3. Escape Velocity

Figure 8: The stages of the Cold Start framework
Let me describe the framework, stage by stage, before jumping into a more detailed unpacking through the rest of the book.
1. The Cold Start Problem
Most new networks fail. If a new video-sharing app launches and doesn't have a wide selection of content early on, users won't stick around. The same is true for marketplaces, social networks, and all the other variations of consumer (and even B2B) products--if users don't find who or what they want, they'll churn. This leads to a self-reinforcing destructive loop. In other words, in most cases the network effects that startups love so much actually hurt them. I call these "anti-network effects" because these dynamics are downright destructive--especially in the early stage as a company is getting off the ground. Solving the

Cold Start Problem requires getting all the right users and content on the same network at the same time--w hich is difficult to execute in a launch.
This is the Cold Start Problem, and to solve it, I look at a series of examples--examining Wikipedia's most prolific content creators, the invention of the credit card, and how Zoom launched a killer product. From these case studies, I describe an approach that focuses on building an "atomic network"--that is, the smallest possible network that is stable and can grow on its own. For example, Zoom's videoconferencing network can work with just two people, whereas Airbnb's requires hundreds of active rental listings in a market to become stable. I look at the product idea at the heart of every network effect, and the similarities many startups have used to pick its features. I also ask, who are the first, most important users to get onto a nascent network, and why? And how do you seed the initial network so that it grows in the way you want?

2. Tipping Point
It takes an enormous amount of effort to build the first atomic network, but it's obviously not enough to just have one. To win a market, it's important to build many, many more networks to expand into the market--but how does this happen, at scale? Luckily, an important dynamic kicks in: as a network grows, each new network starts to tip faster and faster, so that the entire market is more easily captured. This is the second phase of the framework, the Tipping Point. I use Tinder as an example here, showing how their successful initial launch at the University of Southern California unlocked other colleges nearby. This was followed by cities like Los Angeles, then broader regions, and then entire markets--including India and Europe.
Imagine a network launch as tipping over a row of dominos. Each launch makes the next set of adjacent networks easier, and easier, and easier, until the momentum becomes unstoppable--b ut it all radiates

THE COLD START PROBLEM

from a small win at the very start. This is why we so often see the most successful network effects grow city by city, company by company, or campus by campus as rideshare, workplace apps, and social networks have done. SaaS products often grow inside of companies--landing and expanding--a lso jumping between companies as employees share products with partner firms and consultants. This is when a market hits its Tipping Point.

3. Escape Velocity
When a company like Dropbox, Slack, or Uber hits scale, it might seem like network effects kick in, and the next phase is easy. But it's not--to the contrary, this is when technology companies start to hire thousands of people, launch a series of ambitious new projects, and try to continue the product's rapid trajectory. The Escape Velocity stage is all about working furiously to strengthen network effects and to sustain growth.
This is where the classical definition of a "network effect" is wrong. I redefine it so that it's not one singular effect, but rather, three distinct, underlying forces: the Acquisition Effect, which lets products tap into the network to drive low-cost, highly efficient user acquisition via viral growth; the Engagement Effect, which increases interaction between users as networks fill in; and finally, the Economic Effect, which improves monetization levels and conversion rates as the network grows.
By understanding how these forces work, we can accelerate the systems that power them. For example, the Acquisition Effect is powered by viral growth, and a positive early user experience that compels one set of users to invite others into the network. PayPal's viral referral programs, or LinkedIn's recommendations for connecting are two examples of tactics that increase the power behind the Acquisition Effect.
The Engagement Effect manifests itself by increased engagement as the network grows--this can be developed further by conceptually moving users up the "engagement ladder." This is done by introducing

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 46

COLD START THEORY

47

people to new use cases via incentives, marketing/communications, and new product features. Uber did this via leveling users up from airport trips to dining out to daily commutes.
And finally, the Economic Effect--which directly affects a product's business model--can be improved over time as well, by increasing conversions in key monetization flows and ramping up revenue per user, as the network grows. For a product like Slack, for instance, a company is more likely to convert into a paying customer as more teams within it adopt the software. Or games like Fortnite that sell customized costumes and guns will monetize better as a gamer's friends join to play together.
Stitched together, all of these combine into a flywheel that can power networks into the billions of users.

4. Hitting the Ceiling
In many narratives about network effects, by the time a product has hit the Tipping Point, that's the fairy-tale ending of the company--it's won. Ask the operators inside a company, though, and you'll hear a different story: a rapidly growing network wants to both grow as well as tear itself apart, and there are enormous forces in both directions.
This is when a network "hits the ceiling," and growth stalls. This is driven by a variety of forces, starting with customer acquisition costs that often spike due to market saturation, and as viral growth slows down. Similarly, there's the Law of Shitty Clickthroughs, which drives down the performance of acquisition and engagement loops over time, as users tune out of stale marketing channels. There's fraudsters, overcrowding, and context collapse--all natural outcomes of a network that grows and matures. And many other negative forces that grow as the network grows.
In the real world, products tend to grow rapidly, then hit a ceiling, then as the team addresses the problems, another growth spurt emerges.

48

THE COLD START PROBLEM

Then follows another ceiling. Then another cycle after that, each one often successively getting more complex to address over time as the problems become more fundamental.
I look at a series of case studies as major products hit periods of slowing growth: from the implosion of Usenet discussion groups in the early days of the internet, to eBay's slowing US business, to the origins of Nigerian prince scams. In each of these examples, sometimes they are easily dealt with and sometimes they destroy the network over time. The solutions are difficult--a successful product inherently comes with various degrees of spam and trolls. These are problems to be managed, not fully solved.

5. The Moat
The final stage of the framework focuses on using network effects to fend off competitors, which is often the focus as the network and product matures. While it is not the only moat--brand, technology, partnerships, and others can help--it is one of the most important ones in the technology sector.
However, there's a problem--u sing network effects to compete with competitors is tricky when everyone in the same product category is able to take advantage of the same dynamics. Every workplace collaboration is able to leverage network-driven viral growth, higher stickiness, and strong monetization as more users arrive. Same for marketplaces, messaging apps, and so on.
This dynamic drives a unique form of rivalry--"Network-based competition"--that isn't just about better features or execution, but about how one product's ecosystem might challenge another's. Airbnb faced this problem in Europe when a strong, local competitor called Wimdu emerged with a boatload in funding, hundreds of employees, and on paper, more traction in its home market. Airbnb had to fight off its European competitor by competing on the quality of the network,

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 48

COLD START THEORY

49

and scaling its network effects--not via traditional competitive vectors like pricing or features.
Because all products in a category likely have the same type of network effects, competition ends up being asymmetrical while leveraging the same forces. A larger network and a smaller network in any given market have distinctly different strategies--think of it as a David strategy versus a Goliath strategy. The upstart has to pick off niche segments within a larger network, and build atomic networks that are highly defensible with key product features, and, when applicable, better economics and engagement. The incumbent, on the other hand, uses its larger size to drive higher monetization and value for its top users, and fast-following any niches that seem to be growing quickly. I will also examine Uber and Lyft, eBay China and Alibaba, and Microsoft's strategy of bundling new products, to go deeper on how networks compete.

Five Stages
This is the Cold Start Theory. It is made up of five stages for creating, scaling, and defending the network effect, and aims to provide a road map for any new product team--a t a startup or larger company--to leverage in their work.
Entrepreneurs will want to start at the beginning, since the Cold Start Problem is about the launch of new products and companies. On the other hand, teams working on established products will find the middle chapters most relevant--h itting Escape Velocity and optimizing all of your growth loops is the everyday activity of successful products trying to get to the next level.
Cold Start Theory is meant to apply to a large set of companies in the technology industry: video platforms, marketplaces, workplace collaboration tools, bottom-u p SaaS products, social networks and communications apps, and more. Throughout the book, I also draw on historical examples--coupons, credit cards, and early internet protocols. There

THE COLD START PROBLEM

are surprising shared dynamics between archaic forms of communication that we used hundreds of years ago and the modern apps that we use today.
Along the way, I hope you come to see the patterns that underlie networks beyond technology products. Many of these ideas generalize beyond the world of mobile apps, as my friend Naval Ravikant, a noted investor and entrepreneur, has observed:

Humans are the networked species. Networks allow us to cooperate when we would otherwise go it alone. And networks allocate the fruits of our cooperation. Money is a network. Religion is a network. A corporation is a network. Roads are a network. Electricity is a network.6

And furthermore, the stakes of building and controlling successful networks are high:

Networks must be organized according to rules. They require Rulers to enforce these rules. Against cheaters. And the Rulers of these networks become the most powerful people in society.

Cold Start Theory aims to unify these ideas into one framework that is both universal and actionable. Along the way, each chapter lays out a new set of vocabulary to describe the challenges and goals of each stage--with examples, interviews, and research from iconic products from our industry.
Let's get into it. To begin our discussion, I begin with the first stage: the Cold Start Problem, the critical, early phase that lends its name to the book.

TINY SPECK

W hen you start a new product with network effects, the first step is to build a single, tiny network that's self-sustaining on its own. You just need one to get started. However, building even a single network is very hard. So I'm going to start by telling you the story of a product--a nd its network--that failed.
It took four years and ten months to go from founding the startup to shutting down its core product. It was a star team that had seen success in the past, building and selling a company for tens of millions, and as such, it did all the right things. It had an exciting launch, shipping a beta version with fanfare to users after two years, and worked closely with its users to add the right features, to fix bugs, and so on. Out of the gate, it raised $17 million from top investors, hiring forty-five very talented people to build a quirky, fun, delightful product. The startup was called Tiny Speck, and the product it was building was a multiplayer game called Glitch.
Judged by its description alone, Glitch may seem a little "out there." It was a multiplayer game in the browser, and the experience was set inside the heads of eleven giants, with names like Humbada, Lem, and Friendly, who had been dreaming about a new world that got willed into existence. The characters, background, and art looked like they were designed by "Monty Python crossed with Dr. Seuss on acid." Users

THE COLD START PROBLEM

walked around the game world, clicking objects in their environment, and learned skills like fox brushing, potion making, gardening, and teleportation.
Unfortunately, the initial reviews were not good: "[The game's] backstory, involving 11 giants who dreamed the world of the game into existence, is mostly stupid," said the AV Club. Users were not kind, either: "After all the pre-launch hype about changing the face of gaming forever, the game was dreadfully boring--you basically walk around and click on things. I described it to a friend as `FarmVille where you don't get your own farm,'" said user dgreensp on internet discussion site Hacker News.
In the end, users didn't stick around--in an interview years later, the CEO of the company lamented about the poor retention: "Most people, like 97% percent who signed up, would be out of there within five minutes. The thing that killed it was just leaky bucket--I mean, just like very classic, you can put it into Excel in five minutes, and see that this is not going to work." Of course, as a multiplayer game, Glitch would only become fun when a lot of people were playing it and chatting with each other, and the product never achieved enough scale to unlock that social experience.
This is not a unique insight nor a remarkable outcome for a startup. After all, many new products go through a long journey only to end in failure--except one took a strange turn. Years later, Tiny Speck would relaunch with a second product--that product was called Slack. And now, you may know the end of the story, because as of this writing, Slack is used by over 20 million daily active users and by nearly a million businesses. It went from Tiny Speck, a startup that was going to be a complete loss, to Slack Technologies Inc., which eventually exited for $26 billion to Salesforce, all while generating more than $800 million in revenue. The company's CEO, Stewart Butterfield, and his cofounders, Eric Costello, Cal Henderson, and Serguei Mourachov, would successfully pull off one of the startup industry's most incredible reversals of fortune.

It is easy to imagine products like Slack, which have achieved "household name" status, as the epitome of overnight success--b ut networked products are usually not. In Slack's case, it took nearly four years to go from founding Glitch to giving up on this first product, with nearly all of the company's funding spent and employees laid off. It took another two long years to repeat the arduous journey of going from zero to one: to pick a new product, find beta customers, announce the new product broadly, rebuild the team, change the name to Slack, and raise funding for the new strategy. This was the opposite of an overnight success. In fact, I will describe to you in case study after case study that building a product with network effects can both be difficult and slow. But there is a pattern to their success that can be studied and repeated.
The question in Slack's case: What happened between the moment where the company formally started up Slack and the moment when it looked like it was really working? What can be learned? What can be replicated?
Luckily, Tiny Speck was backed by Andreessen Horowitz many years back--all the way at the beginning, at the formation of the company--b y my colleague John O'Farrell, and he put me in touch with Stewart Butterfield and early employee Ali Rayl to give me the story. Here's what they told me.
First, let's go back to the beginning in 2009, when the team was still building Glitch. Stewart and his cofounders had attracted dozens of engineers from all over the place, including San Francisco and Vancouver (where the founders were initially based). Today we would recognize this as an important preview of a broader, more transformational trend around remote work. But at that point, remote work was just nascent, which meant that the tools supporting this type of work were also nonexistent.
To help the team work together, they used a tool for chat with each other. It was not the kind of beautiful product that you and I would use today. It was all text. It had funny commands that started with a "/" because it was based on an old piece of technology, Internet Relay Chat

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 55

9/28/21 4:42 PM

56

THE COLD START PROBLEM

(IRC), originally built by Finnish university employee Jarkko Oikarinen. IRC was first created in 1988, during an earlier phase on the internet, when user-friendliness was not a priority. Thus, for novices, IRC was practically unusable, and as Stewart would later describe:

IRC pre-dates the Web by a couple years. And because it's so old, it misses a bunch of features that are now considered just standard.7

IRC didn't have search. It didn't store old messages. It was confusing to find the right set of channels and people to talk to--you had to download one of many different IRC apps, connect to an IRC server, and join the right channel.
So the Tiny Speck team built a chat tool on top of IRC, building in the ability to store old messages and photos, and to make conversations easily searchable. This was the chat tool that glued some important workflows together, and in the early years, it wasn't even called anything, much less Slack. The service was hosted internally at irc.tinyspeck.com and nevertheless was very useful, as it allowed easy sharing of images, animations, and server logs. Many of the nontechnical employees weren't comfortable with IRC, and so instead, they were onboarded into the company's weird little chat app. This unnamed tool--early employee Ali Rayl called it a "frankentool" that sort of did everything--enabled team-wide collaboration, and became part of the core workflow at Tiny Speck.
When it was clear that Glitch was not going to work, the team needed a new idea. Stewart, Cal, and the cofounders decided that the next move was to work on what was right in front of them--to take the functional but unremarkable internal tool, and redesign it so anyone could use it. The tool soon was code-named Linefeed, at least for a few days. Other days, it was called Honeycomb, and other days Chatly.io, and a litany of other names.
Whatever it was called, the product that would become Slack was rearchitected to allow any company to use it, not just Tiny Speck. It was

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 56

TINY SPECK

57

rebuilt with its own back end, not IRC. It supported searchable conversations, hosted photos and other assets easily, and automatically backed up conversations, solving all the issues IRC had. With these key features, "Slack" was picked to mean "Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge." Although some on the board disliked the name, thinking it was strange for the users of the product to be called "Slackers," the product was soon launched.
The second step was a private beta-testing period with friends of the company, where Stewart would personally reach out, try to get them to use Slack, and iterate to add features and improve the experience. I asked Stewart if he was careful to target the initial base of customers, and he said:

No, not at all. I just had friends at other companies and I would try to convince them to use us. We didn't have any teams for demand gen, field marketing, or anything else at the time--it was just me. Sometimes it would take dozens of meetings to convince people why it was cool.8

He had friends at startups like Rdio, Wantful, and Cozy, and eventually signed up forty-five companies in all. The teams that adopted tended to be other startups, for a very good reason:

Technology startups adopted us early because they have the belief, whether naive or not, that software can better their lives. These startups were just like us--many of the early teams had fewer than 10 people, just like Slack.

Stewart and Ali Rayl, who ran customer experience, would personally handle all the feedback on social media and customer support tickets. Even once Slack publicly launched, Stewart personally handled the lion's share of 10,000 tweets per month and 8,000 customer support tickets.

58

THE COLD START PROBLEM

Each of these beta customers formed an atomic network--a stable, self-sustaining group of users who can drive a network effect. Once an atomic network was formed in one of their beta testers, Slack would continually add users, become more useful, ramp up engagement, and ultimately become the de facto method of communication within their workplaces. The minimum number of people to be defined as a team, even today at Slack, is three. As long as you have three people, it can be stable. But it's even better if there's a larger team of fifty people in an organic unit--like a department--or an entire company of thousands that joins the product. Then it will just grow and grow.
The Slack team learned more and more as the product was tried with larger networks. "The pattern was to share Slack with progressively larger groups. We would say, `Oh, that great idea isn't so great after all.' We amplified the feedback we got at each stage by adding more teams," Butterfield said, in an interview in Fast Company.
The team learned how groups of 120 people, like that at Rdio, would use a product and how it spread--from front-end developers to engineering and then to the entire company. Early on, a team of ten might only have a few channels. But a team of hundreds would suddenly create four different, mostly empty channels for activities like hiking, as Rdio did. It turned out that helping users discover channels was a problem. An even larger organization might need help with features like a "team directory" to figure out who worked at the company and what they did. Each increase in team size required a rethinking of the design, in order to form stable atomic networks that would grow.
Like many of the examples I'll visit later on, Slack is a network of networks. Within a larger company, a whole collection of atomic networks would spontaneously emerge and begin growing on their own. Stewart described to me how a large company might have tens of thousands of workspaces, each with its own set of channels. Each workspace might be a business unit or subsidiary, and each smaller team might independently have a ringleader or early adopter who set up the product, invited coworkers in, and started initiating conversations with others.

In later years, when the company added an enterprise sales team, they would target large customers who had adopted Slack across multiple parts of their company and ask if they wanted to go "wall-to-wall," bringing the entire company onboard in exchange for added security/ enterprise features as well as company-w ide pricing. Enterprise sales became a huge accelerator a few years into the company's launch.
Many of these ideas for increasing adoption through viral growth are borrowed from consumer products. This is true not only for Slack but also for many of the new B2B products developed around their time period, like Zoom and Dropbox. These companies pioneered a new style of "bottom-up" growth, where individual contributors seeded a product's adoption within a customer company. Slack was early in this phase of the market, and had to invent many of the paradigms. Yet this was a team that understood the ingredients deeply. At the founders' previous startup, Flickr, one of the largest photo-sharing sites of the Web 2.0 era, they popularized what would become tagging photos and communal streams of content organized around topics and events. As a college student, Stewart was a passionate user of some of the earliest precursors to social apps for the internet: Usenet, which are old-school discussion forums; MUDs/MOOs, which are text-based virtual worlds; and of course IRC.
Eventually, Tiny Speck rebranded as Slack Technologies, and its new flagship product was launched to the world. In August 2013, when Slack debuted, 8,000 companies signed up to the wait list to try the product. Within two weeks, this grew to 15,000. By the next year, Slack would have 135,0000 paying subscribers and 10,000 new users signing up per day. Soon after that, a million daily active users, then two, then three, and so on. Stewart and the company--n ow 100 percent focused on Slack--would raise their next round in April 2014, fully completing their transition.
Slack has an incredible story, and there's much to learn across many dimensions. But for the purpose of this book, the journey from unnamed IRC tool to Linefeed to Slack is most remarkable in its demonstration

THE COLD START PROBLEM

of how to think about starting from zero: how they incubated a killer product, solving a problem that their own team acutely needed. And how Tiny Speck built individual stable networks, piecing together a network-of-networks at larger companies. This is one of the best examples of solving the Cold Start Problem.

Introducing the Cold Start
The book is named after the first stage because, quite frankly, it's the most important one. New products die when they flub their initial entry into the market, and their networks collapse before they even start. Every networked product, including Slack, starts with just a single network. The next few chapters are about how to build this first one, using the launch stories of Wikipedia, the original credit cards, Tinder, and Zoom.
First, I start with the principal dilemma, which I call "Anti-Network Effects." It's a myth that network effects are all powerful and positive forces--q uite the opposite. Small, sub-scale networks naturally want to self-d estruct, because when people show up to a product and none of their friends or coworkers are using it, they will naturally leave. What solves this? "The Atomic Network"--the smallest network where there are enough people that everyone will stick around.
These networks often have "sides," whether they are buyers and sellers, or content creators and consumers. Generally one side of the network will be easier to attract--this is the easy side of the network. However, the most important part of any early network is attracting and retaining "The Hard Side" of a network--the small percentage of people that typically end up doing most of the work within the community. For example, most of Wikipedia was written by a tiny percentage of prolific editors. A small group of drivers, about 5 percent of Uber's users, carry most of the load within the rideshare marketplace--riders are numerous but engage less frequently and deeply. To attract the hard

61

side, you need to "Solve a Hard Problem"--design a product that is sufficiently compelling to the key subset of your network. Tinder did this for the most attractive users in its network, which I'll use as an example.
Not only does a product have to appeal to the hard side of the network, but as I discuss in "The Killer Product," the most successful network effects­driven apps are also sometimes dead simple. They eschew a long list of features and instead emphasize the interactions among people using the app. Zoom is just such an example. Although there was a long list of potential investors and industry pundits were skeptical of such a simple product, Zoom is a great example of a killer product that leverages network effects.
When the Cold Start Problem is solved, a product is able to consistently create "Magic Moments." Users open the product and find a network that is built out, meaning they can generally find whoever and whatever they're looking for. The network effects kick in, and the market hits its Tipping Point as users start coming to you.

A N T I - N E T WO R K EFFECTS

Successes like Slack capture our imagination--it's incredible to hear its origin story as a failed gaming startup and subsequent journey into a $27 billion exit. Yet for every successful launch like Slack, there are many more that are failures--a nd they usually stumble right at the start.
Anti-n etwork effects are the negative force that drives new networks to zero. While the industry tends to focus on the positive results of network effects, at their inception, network effects are a destructive force, driven by a vicious--not virtuous--cycle where new users churn because not enough other users are there yet. For Slack, it doesn't make sense to use the product until your colleagues are also on the platform. For Uber, you can't use the service until there are enough drivers, who won't drive until there are enough rides. This first stage of creating a network is the hardest, and some will call it a "chicken and egg" situation or needing to "bootstrap" a community. I call it the "Cold Start Problem."
In the classic mythology of startup success, a small group of young founders are working away, perhaps in a loft in the warehouse district

THE COLD START PROBLEM

of a cool, coastal tech hub. They build a killer product, which creates a new way for people to interact, whether that's a communications app, a way to share documents, or a way to buy and sell a service. Whether they know it or not, the product has a network, and thus network effects. Of course, in this mythology, they launch the product to the world, and it's an immediate hockey stick. It generates incredible buzz in the tech press and in the wider internet community. Eventually it spreads around the world and is used by many millions of people.
This mythology conveniently skips the part of the story when the network is sub-s cale and lacks activity. The reality is that new products are often greeted by a nice initial spike of users, but this falls to a trickle as the novelty wears off. Maybe there's another push, which again goes nowhere. People won't use their product unless their friends are on it. Features are feverishly added, marketing efforts are redoubled, but the network never gets off the ground, and the team ultimately is out of runway. They didn't solve the Cold Start Problem, and the result is failure.
The Cold Start Problem is the first challenge that new networks must face. Beating this initial challenge is very hard. Just look at the metrics: there are tens of thousands of social, communications, and marketplace startups but just a few dozen ones that have become large, independent companies. It's already hard to start a new company, but there is even more difficulty within the winner-take-all dynamics of these product categories.
Or take marketplace startups, as a subcategory of products. In a recent analysis by Andreessen Horowitz of the top 100 marketplace startups, just four of the top products drive 76 percent of all the gross revenue--there is immense concentration at the top. Other categories like social networking and collaboration tools are the same, where just a handful of products have built audiences of over a billion users. Yet these categories remain attractive because they produce the most valuable companies in the world, and they shape the technology industry

in which we live and work. Understanding these dynamics is the key to understanding the future.

What's Enough?
For the first user of Slack within a workplace, the experience won't be great if there are zero other users. But what if they encounter one other coworker also using Slack--is that enough? Or two? How many do you really need? Stewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, answered this question for me:
Slack works with just 2 people, but it takes 3 to make it really work. There are long-running 3 person groups that are stable-- that's the minimum required to be called a customer.
And how Slack users engage each other matters as well. It's not enough to sign up, but they also need to be chatting away over time. Eventually once they reach a threshold--for Slack it was approximately 2,000 messages--w here they'll stick around and keep using the product:
"Based on our experience of which companies stuck with us and which didn't, we decided that any team that has exchanged 2,000 messages in its history has tried Slack--really tried it," Butterfield says. "For a team around 50 people that means about 10 hours' worth of messages. For a typical team of 10 people, that's maybe a week's worth of messages. But it hit us that, regardless of any other factor, after 2,000 messages, 93% of those customers are still using Slack today."9
This idea can be generalized to a wide variety of products beyond Slack.

THE COLD START PROBLEM

How many users does your network need before the product experience becomes good? The way to answer this is for companies to do an analysis on the size of their networks (on the X-axis) plotted against a set of important engagement metrics (on the Y-a xis). For Uber, this chart showed that more drivers generally meant a lower waiting time, and thus more users--at least up to some point. Eventually, the difference between two minutes to get a car or one minute to get a car becomes diminishing returns. Facebook's famous growth maxim, "10 friends in 7 days," is an expression of the same idea.
Users who come in with more friends have higher retention, so you want to maximize it, at least up to a point of diminishing returns. Do enough of these analyses, and some interesting patterns will show up-- you'll find the kink in the curve that tells you how much network density is needed to really spike up usage. Every product has this threshold, although some require higher numbers and some are lower. Zoom is also a workplace communications tool and has a low threshold requirement to form a stable network. Eric Yuan, CEO of Zoom, said to me:

You just need two people. One who wants to call someone else and have a conversation--that's enough for Zoom to be useful for both people and to have them keep using it.10

Airbnb and Uber, on the other hand, are two-sided marketplaces that require more than one or two parties involved given the hyper local constraints. Here, choice matters a lot--y ou might want to browse dozens of different Airbnb listings or request cars from many different neighborhoods in the city. As a result, the numbers to get to a good product experience are much larger--for Airbnb, early employee Jonathan Golden said:

Cofounder Nate Blecharczyk is highly quantitative and had determined that 300 listings, with 100 reviewed listings, was the magic number to see growth take off in a market.11

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 66

Uber tries to optimize based on getting customers their cars quickly, based on the metric of ETAs--their estimated time of arrival. Chris Nakutis Taylor, one of the early general managers at Uber, describes their importance:

ETAs were always terrible to start. +15 min in some areas, especially in the suburbs. There was another key metric. Get ETAs down under 3 min on average as quickly as possible while covering the whole city.
If you could get ETAs, unfulfilleds, and surge down quickly, you'll have a healthy market.12

William Barnes, another early GM who was one of the first fifty employees and launched Los Angeles, describes the early ad hoc calculation:

The strategy was "let's get a bunch of cars on the road" and try and get their ETAs and the request conversion rate (the % who purchase a ride) to reasonable levels. In LA and other big cities, the goal was to try to get 15­20 concurrent online cars on the road at the same time. LA's launch was notoriously expensive because we worked hard to get that all in West Hollywood at launch.13

The higher the requirement, the harder it is to get started, but the more defensible the product is in the long run. In Uber's case, as much as critics have occasionally argued that the company lacks defensibility and network effects, today it maintains a big advantage on upstarts who can no longer solve the Cold Start Problem in the same way.
Conceptually, understanding that a product has a critical threshold is helpful, but practically speaking, what do you do with this metric? For new products, it's important to have a hypothesis for the size of your network even before you begin. Communication apps can be 1:1,

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 67

9/28/21 4:42 PM

68

THE COLD START PROBLEM

so the network is small, and you can plan accordingly. Contrast that to products that are highly asymmetrical, with content creators and viewers, or marketplaces with buyers and sellers--these are likely to require a much bigger number to hit the threshold, and require a much bigger effort to get started. The size of an initial network helps determine a launch strategy.

The Antidote to the Cold Start Problem
Solving the Cold Start Problem requires a team to launch a network and quickly create enough density and breadth such that the user experience can improve in leaps and bounds. In Slack's case, you can think of it as how likely it is that the person you're looking for within your company uses Slack, and how likely it is they'll reply. If the network is small and sparse, you may not be able to message who you want, or when you do, because they use it infrequently, they won't reply quickly. Your coworker will just wonder why you didn't send them an email.
If you add more people, but add the wrong people, then it still won't be enough. You need the right people on the network. Ten people using Slack all from the same team is better than ten random people in a larger company. Density and interconnectedness is key.
Eventually, once you add enough users to the Slack network, it becomes the default way to reach out to someone in the office. You might use it for 1:1 messages, but start to also use it to share meeting agendas on conference calls, summarize outcomes, or a myriad of other use cases. Engagement, retention, and monetization all increase. It's not magic--it's not a black/white switch that takes you from a sub-scale network to a working one. Instead, it feels like a gradual series of improvements in the core metrics as the network fills in.

The solution to the Cold Start Problem starts by understanding how to add a small group of the right people, at the same time, using the product in the right way. Getting this initial network off the ground is the key, and the key is the "atomic network"--the smallest, stable network from which all other networks can be built.

THE ATOMIC NETWORK
Credit Cards

If you study the launch of products with network effects, you'll see that one of the most common threads is that they often start small, in a single city, college campus, or in small beta tests at individual companies--like Slack's story. Only once they nail it in a smaller network do they build up over time to eventually conquer the world.
If you can create one stable, engaged network that can self-s ustain-- a n atomic network--then likely you can build a second network adjacent to the first one. And if you can build 1, and then 2, you can probably build 10 or 100 networks. Copy and paste many times, and you can build a huge interconnected network that spans the entire market.
For companies like Uber that exist both offline and online, it might seem obvious that a city-b y-city approach is the right strategy. But there's a history of products like Tinder and Facebook growing from tight-knit college communities, as well as B2B companies like Slack that grow team by team within a larger company. There's a reason for this, and in this chapter I'll explain why, starting with one of the most important inventions in the past century.

THE COLD START PROBLEM

Launching the First Credit Card

There is a fantastic example of the atomic network, not from the technology industry, but rather, from consumer finance: the invention of the first credit card, in 1958.
I first heard about the creation of the credit card from Alex Rampell, my colleague at Andreessen Horowitz focused on fintech. In an essay on the topic, Alex writes:

Credit cards and payment cards are arguably the most valuable network in the world, with at least $1 trillion of publicly traded market cap. On September 18, 1958, it all began in the little town of Fresno, California.
At the time, there were "charge cards," like Diner's Club, but there was no "credit" being extended. For consumers, lines of credit were either specific to a merchant (like Sears), or a burdensome process. If you wanted to get a loan, you had to go to the bank in person.14

Credit cards have network effects for the same reasons that marketplaces do: they aggregate consumers, merchants, and other financial institutions as a multi-s ided network. Everyone in the network benefits, particularly the consumer, who can go shopping without carrying physical cash. Merchants and banks are happy, too. And the bigger the network gets--meaning more consumers, more places where credit cards are accepted, etc.--the more useful the network. This in turn drives new merchants and consumers to adopt it.
Bank of America invented the credit card, and picked Fresno, California, as its first test site. It would just focus on this single city--why?

Fresno was chosen as the first test site partly because of its size-- with a population around 250,000, it offered the critical mass the bank thought necessary to make a credit card work--a nd partly be-

THE ATOMIC NETWORK

73

cause a staggering 45 percent of Fresno's families did some business with the Bank of America.15

To get the product into the hands of consumers, Joseph Williams of Bank of America, who led this project, conducted the world's first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards. Alex describes this further:

On September 18, the bank mailed 60,000 Fresno residents a BankAmericard. There was no application process. The card simply arrived in the mailbox, ready to use. Credit card fees for merchants were set at 6 percent and consumers received between $300 and $500 in instant credit. There was a certain brilliance behind the 60,000-person drop: On day 1, cardholders simply existed. This permitted Bank of America to sign up all merchants who didn't already have proprietary credit card programs. BofA focused on fast-m oving, small merchants like Florsheim Shoes, not giants like Sears. More than 300 Fresno merchants signed up.
Within three months, Bank of America had expanded its customer base to Modesto in the north and Bakersfield to the south. Within a year, it added San Francisco, Sacramento, and Los Angeles. Thirteen months after the initial Fresno drop, the bank had issued 2 million cards and onboarded 20,000 merchants.

The concept of an atomic network is immediately obvious here. Although Bank of America served all of California, they didn't focus on trying to launch across the entire state at once, but rather, they focused on Fresno, a town where they had a high degree of penetration. On top of that, they focused on a moment in time--B ank of America issued all the credit cards on the same day, so that there would be a tipping point of people with the cards in their wallets, ready to use them. And after getting the cards in the hands of consumers, they focused on a specific segment of small merchants in the downtown corridor of the town, to

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 73

9/28/21 4:42 PM

74

THE COLD START PROBLEM

complete the other side of the network. These simultaneous moves combined to create the first atomic network for credit cards, starting one of the most valuable networks of all time.

The Atomic Network
Whether for credit cards, multiplayer games, or business collaboration software, the "atomic network" is the smallest network needed that can stand on its own. It needs to have enough density and stability to break through early anti-n etwork effects, and ultimately grow on its own. I liken it to an atom because it is the unit upon which larger networks are ultimately built. If you can build one, and then another, you can build the rest of the network--this is the base unit to build everything else.
In Slack's case, the atomic network turned out to be pretty small. The threshold was just the team of people around you--under ten in a single company might be enough--and there would be enough chat activity to sustain user engagement. Contrast that to the credit card, which needed to launch in an entire city to make it work. After all, they had to sign a critical mass of retailers and consumers, and it makes sense to sign up most of a downtown commerce district as part of the strategy.
To build an atomic network requires a hodgepodge of different tools. Common themes emerge when you look at Slack's strong network launch as well as the successes across marketplaces, social networks, developer platforms, and dozens of other categories. Many of them are counterintuitive: The networked product should be launched in its simplest possible form--n ot fully featured--so that it has a dead simple value proposition. The target should be on building a tiny, atomic network--the smallest that could possibly make sense--and focus on building density, ignoring the objection of "market size." And finally, the attitude in executing the launch should be "do whatever it takes"--

THE ATOMIC NETWORK

75

even if it's unscalable or unprofitable--to get momentum, without worrying about how to scale.
Embedded within Slack's strategy, and the strategy of many earlystage networked products, is a series of short-term boosts--o ften called "growth hacks"--which are important in forming the initial atomic networks. In Slack's case, it was their incredible buzz within the early- adopter startup community, and their invite-only launch. There are other famous examples: The $5 referral fee that lit up the original PayPal network, or Dropbox's demo video on Hacker News that created a huge line of folks excited to try the magical cloud-storage product. Or the "Uber Ice Cream" promotions letting people order soft-serve ice cream, on demand, via the rideshare app. In the early days, local newspapers and social media would often cover the ice cream promotion, which helped build out the rideshare network. Each of these growth hacks gave an important, quick lift that established an atomic network, kicking off future growth.
Once a single atomic network can be built, it becomes straightforward to build many others by repeating the same playbook. For Slack, an early-adopter team might start using the product regularly, until it starts to grow organically inside the company. Eventually the entire company upgrades to become paying customers. Rinse and repeat. Slack's earliest customers were other startups, but eventually, atomic networks started to form inside larger customers like IBM or other Fortune 500 companies. Once Slack could build a dense network that sustained a single team, it could eventually take over an enterprise.

Why Starting with a Niche Works
The atomic network is a complementary point of view to Clayton Christensen's Disruption Theory. These small networks often grow in niches, slowly growing to take over the entire market. Chris Dixon, my colleague

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 75

9/28/21 4:42 PM

76

THE COLD START PROBLEM

at a16z, summarized the idea in an essay titled, appropriately, "The next big thing will start out looking like a toy."

Disruptive technologies are dismissed as toys because when they are first launched they "undershoot" user needs. The first telephone could only carry voices a mile or two. The leading telco of the time, Western Union, passed on acquiring the phone because they didn't see how it could possibly be useful to businesses and railroads-- their primary customers. What they failed to anticipate was how rapidly telephone technology and infrastructure would improve (technology adoption is usually non-linear due to so-c alled complementary network effects). The same was true of how mainframe companies viewed the PC (microcomputer), and how modern telecom companies viewed Skype.16

I think Chris is right, but I would extend this idea further into the target audience, too. Not only will the product initially look like a toy, but as a corollary to Disruption Theory, there is a huge benefit to picking a smaller and more targeted starting point. Nail this initial niche network, establish an atomic network, and grow from there. In other words:

The next big thing will start out looking like it's for a niche network.

Networked products often look like toys, and moreover, toys for a weird niche. This is why they are easy to underestimate. The atomic networks are forming in niche audiences like teens or gamers, and picking up a lot of buzz, but it's not clear yet that it will be interesting to the mainstream. But that may soon change, as the network gets built out. In the meantime, you're not in the target audience, and that's okay.
Underestimating new products in this way is the number one way to make dumb predictions in the tech industry. It's what leads pundits to

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 76

9/28/21 4:42 PM

THE ATOMIC NETWORK

77

say a product won't work, isn't interesting, or has a small market size-- followed by that product proving them wrong just a few years later. These erroneous predictions are understandable, because it's hard for a product to resonate when its network doesn't include you, your friends, or your colleagues. The addressable market will seem small, and it's not until relevant people join that the product will feel like it's for you. It's not that product changes are needed--it's that the network needs to fill out to the point where the people and content are relevant.

Picking Your Atomic Network
The first step to launching an atomic network is to have a hypothesis about what it might look like. My advice: Your product's first atomic network is probably smaller and more specific than you think. Not a massive segment of users, or a particular customer segment, or a city, but instead something tiny, maybe on the order of hundreds of people, at a specific moment in time. It was similar for Uber, whose networks we tend to talk about as "San Francisco" or "New York," but in the earliest days, the focus was on narrow, ephemeral moments--m ore like "5pm at the Caltrain station at 5th and King St." The general managers and Driver Operations had an internal tool, called Starcraft--referring to the real-time strategy game popular at the time--that allowed them to click on a group of cars, text them "Go to the train, lots of riders!" and direct them in real time.
Once rides start to consistently happen at these moments, then the discussion might shift to focus on the wider network defined by the 7x7 square miles of the city, then adding the suburbs of East Bay and Silicon Valley as the next step. Years later, a company might talk about entire countries or mega-regions, like EMEA or APAC, but in the early days, it's about something much more focused. It should be about building the smallest possible group.
Whereas our typical business verbiage revolves around aggregations

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 77

9/28/21 4:42 PM

78

THE COLD START PROBLEM

of millions of people--that's usually what we mean when we talk about "markets," "segments," and "demographics"--the language of launching new networks should be focused on groupings of a handful of people, with the right intent, in the right situation, at the right time. This is true in dating apps, marketplaces, but even in workplace products. The wedge begins with "The Q2 planning cycle in the Product team at Chase Bank."
The more users you need to get to an atomic network, the harder it is to create. There are networked products with small minimum size requirements, for example the telephone, a communications product like Snapchat, or Zoom for videoconferencing. This makes it much easier to get started--b ecause as long as you can get each new user to find a friend that's already on the network, or to invite a friend, then it'll work. No wonder these are some of the stickiest, fastest-g rowing products, too. But there are drawbacks, too, because what's easier for you will be easier for your competitors--they just need a few users to get started as well, which is why there are so many messaging apps and chat features inside larger products.
Let's look at the other end of the spectrum on network size. There are enterprise products like Workday (a financial HR management tool) that require the company to implement them before there's any value. Here, a viral growth strategy is difficult, because it's not enough to dribble in a few users at a time. If you need hundreds of users on the same platform at once, company-w ide coordination is needed. In this situation, a top-down enterprise sale that gets a company to mandate usage for everyone might work better.

The Power of Atomic Networks
Growing city by city, campus by campus, or team by team is a surprisingly powerful strategy. It leads to dense, organic connections of users that strengthen network effects across multiple dimensions: Engage-

9/28/21 4:42 PM

THE ATOMIC NETWORK

79

ment goes up, because users are more likely to find other relevant users. Viral growth goes up when prospective users of a product see that their friends and colleagues are all using the service. In the earlier example of Bank of America's credit card launch, focusing on one city at a time made it more likely that customers would find local merchants that accepted this novel new method of payment. Contrast that to when you peanut-b utter your efforts across a whole industry or geography--the active parts of the network rapidly dissipate as anti-n etwork effects kick in, because a network of 1,000 random users of Slack will have less retention than 1,000 users all inside the same company.
The concept of atomic networks is powerful because if you can build one, you can probably build two. Each one often becomes easier, because each network can be intertwined with the next--S lack's success within one company can help it become successful in another, as employees move about and introduce the product to new workplaces. Facebook's early campus launches became easier over time as students' friends at different schools began to demand the product more and more. Build a few atomic networks, and soon you can copy and paste them into many, many markets.
There's a big question at the heart of all of this: What does it take to build an atomic network in the first place? And why is it so hard? To answer this, I'll start with an important sub-segment of every network that has to be made happy in order for it to function.

THE HARD SIDE
Wikipedia

E ven at the start of an atomic network, there is an important and surprising dynamic at play that only increases over time: there is a minority of users that create disproportionate value and as a result, have disproportionate power.
This the "hard side" of your network. They do more work and contribute more to your network, but are that much harder to acquire and retain. For social networks, these are often the content creators that generate the media everyone consumes. For app stores, these are the developers that actually create the products. For workplace apps, these are the managers that author and create documents and projects, and who invite coworkers to participate. For marketplaces, these are usually the sellers and providers who spend their entire day attracting users with their products and services.
Sometimes the hard side is obvious, but I encourage you to think deeply about which side is which, because it can be nuanced. For instance, large-scale job listings marketplaces are inverted compared to most other marketplaces. The companies looking to hire--the buyers--are the hard side, whereas the supply of talent is generally easier to acquire.

THE COLD START PROBLEM

You might look at a product and think its network doesn't have sides. Sometimes this is referred to in the industry as one-sided networks, like messaging apps and social networks. But even in these cases, there are active, extroverted users who initiate conversations and organize get-togethers, and there are those who don't. Nearly every network has them, and the hard side must all be happy for the network to function. When they work, they generate what academics often call "cross-side network effects"--w hen more users in one side of the network benefits the other side of the network. At Uber, more drivers help lower prices and ETAs for riders, and more riders helps drivers successfully earn fares.
Needless to say, acquiring the hard side of the network and keeping them happy is paramount to standing up an atomic network. To understand the motivations of these users, let's describe one of the largest networked products ever built--W ikipedia.

The Volunteers Who Built Wikipedia
Wikipedia is one of the largest websites on the internet, often ranked #8 or #9 depending on the month, just above Amazon and Netflix, and well above eBay and LinkedIn. It generates over 18 billion page views and 500 million unique visitors a month, with articles across an enormous variety of topics. It's a networked product, with visitors looking for content and editors contributing articles. And the editors have contributed a ton--since Wikipedia's founding in 2001, more than 55 million articles have been written on the site. Wikipedia itself lists some facts about its size in comparison to paper encyclopedias:
Currently, the English Wikipedia alone has over 6,308,342 articles of any length, and the combined Wikipedias for all other languages greatly exceed the English Wikipedia in size, giving more than 29

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 82

9/28/21 4:42 PM

THE HARD SIDE

83

billion words in 55 million articles in 309 languages. The English Wikipedia alone has over 3.9 billion words, and has over 90 times as many words as the 120-volume English-language Encyclopædia Britannica.17

It may surprise you to know that all of Wikipedia--w ith more than 55 million articles--was written by a small group of users. Not just small, actually, but tiny. Even though there are hundreds of millions of users, there are only about 100,000 active contributors per month, and when you look at the small group of writers who make more than 100+ edits in a month, it's about 4,000 people. As a ratio, it means that active contributors represent only 0.02% of the total viewer pool.
The motivations of these contributors are worth studying. Within the most hyperactive group of editors is a contributor named Steven Pruitt, a records and information officer for US Customs and Border Patrol Protection. Steven edits Wikipedia in his spare time--b ut when I say spare time, it's almost like a part-time job. CBS News covered his contributions to Wikipedia in 2019, as the editor with the most edits on English Wikipedia:

Steven Pruitt has made nearly 3 million edits on Wikipedia and written 35,000 original articles. It's earned him not only accolades but almost legendary status on the internet.
Pruitt was named one of the most influential people on the internet by Time magazine in part because one-third of all English language articles on Wikipedia have been edited by Steven. An incredible feat, ignited by a fascination with his own history.
Pulling from books, academic journals and other sources, he spends more than three hours a day researching, editing and writing.18

And how much does he earn by doing this? Nothing. He's a volunteer editor. While it might seem strange to some of us to spend hours

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 83

THE COLD START PROBLEM

per day writing on Wikipedia, when you look across user-generated products, this is actually the norm, not the exception. There are nearly 100 million riders on Uber, but just a few million drivers. There are two billion active users on YouTube, but just a few million upload videos. Even think about all the people who write documents and make presentations versus those who just view or make small edits. This relationship exists everywhere.

The Easy Side versus the Hard Side
Why is there a hard side at all? Hard sides exist because there are tasks in any networked product that just require more work, whether that's selling products, organizing projects, or creating content. Users on the hard side have complex workflows, expect status benefits as well as financial outcomes, and will try competitive products to compare. As a result, their expectations are higher, and it's difficult to engage and retain them.
The good news is, the hard side of the network creates a ton more value. At the extreme, you can look at a platform like Valve's Steam, which lets users buy and download games--this is a kind of two-sided network where the hard side of the network is game developers. The best game developer on the platform might build a single piece of content that is downloaded millions of times and require tens of millions of dollars of investment and hundreds of people to create. In a less extreme example of value creation, the best Uber drivers will work many times more hours than the average driver (who is part-t ime), but the difference is not as stark as with a digital good like content or an app. In both cases though, the game developers and drivers have to put in a lot more effort than the consumers of both services. Consumers are generally the easy side of a network, and are typically cheaper and easier to attract and retain.
Because the hard side is so critical, it is imperative to have hypoth-

eses about how a product will cater to these users from day one. A successful new product should be able to answer detailed questions: Who is the hard side of your network, and how will they use the product? What is the unique value proposition to the hard side? (And in turn, the easy side of the network.) How do they first hear about the app, and in what context? For users on the hard side, as the network grows, why will they come back more frequently and become more engaged? What makes them sticky to your network such that when a new network emerges, they will retain on your product? These are difficult answers, and require a deep understanding of the motivations of your users.
The motivations of the hard side depend on the product category-- content creators have different goals than marketplace sellers. Those who use workplace collaboration tools have yet another set of motivations. Understanding these diverse points of view makes it easier to serve them.

The Hard Side of Social Content Apps
Content creators are the core of a wide class of networked products that at their foundation is about creating, sharing, and consuming content. These are some of the largest and fastest-growing products in the world, with billions of monthly active users, like TikTok, Twitch, YouTube, Instagram. As I discussed earlier, Wikipedia falls into this category, too-- and they are a tiny slice of a much larger network of users.
In a widely read essay called "Creators, Synthesizers, and Consumers," Bradley Horowitz, now a vice president of product at Google, described the 1 percent of users who create versus everyone else:
· 1% of the user population might start a group (or a thread within a group)
· 10% of the user population might participate actively, and

actually author content whether starting a thread or responding to a thread-in-p rogress · 100% of the user population benefits from the activities of the above groups (lurkers)19

This is often called the "1/10/100" rule, and it's no surprise that the 1 percent of highly engaged users is extremely valuable. For YouTube, Instagram, and other content-sharing platforms, there is a "power law" curve where the 20 percent of top influencers and content creators end up with the vast majority of engagement. They attract millions of followers, and make content that generates tens of millions of views.
This describes what happens, but it doesn't describe why. More recently, Evan Spiegel, CEO and cofounder of Snap, described his understanding of the content creation pyramid for Snap and Instagram, versus TikTok:

You can imagine a pyramid, if you will, of internet technology or communications technology, where the base of the pyramid--the very broad base--is self-expression and communication. And that's what Snapchat is really about. Talking to your friends, which is something everyone is comfortable doing. They just express how they feel.
As the pyramid gets narrower, you have the next layer, which is status. Social media in its original construct is really about status, representing who you are, showing people that you're cool, getting likes and comments. Those sorts of things. And that's less accessible to the broad base of humanity, and has a narrower base of appeal. [There's a] more limited frequency of engagement, because people only do some things that are cool once a week or once a month, and not every day.
At the top of the pyramid, which I think is represented by TikTok, is really talent. People who have spent a couple hours learning a new dance, or think about a funny new creative way to tell

a story. They're really making media to entertain other people. I think that's even narrower. . . . 20

In Spiegel's pyramid, people have emotional needs--whether that's self-expression, status, or communication--a nd create different forms of content to achieve them. Sending an ephemeral photo is easy, particularly a selfie on the go, which anyone can do. But spending hours to learn a new TikTok dance is difficult, and not everyone can do it. The more difficult the work needed to be part of the hard side of a network, the smaller the percentage of users who will participate.
For Snapchat, there is the simple value proposition of communicating with your friends, and deepening your relationship with them over time--that's the utility. Yet across many other platforms, particularly "broadcast" apps where you share videos or photos widely, the value proposition is displaying your status. No wonder our Instagram feeds are photos of travel adventures, cars, concerts, working out, and so on. Users become addicted to the "social feedback loop"--y ou publish content, and others see it and engage in the form of likes, shares, and comments. When this feedback is positive, it drives the creator to generate even more content.
The social feedback loop is a core concept because the creator/ viewer network is so ubiquitous as a network structure. We also see this structure in categories beyond content sharing. We can see these motivations among individuals who organize group chats in WhatsApp, events on platforms like Eventbrite, writers who publish email newsletters, reviewers who love to curate their favorite restaurants on Yelp, and so on. Within these platforms, just ask yourself, "If a piece of content was created, and no one saw it, would the creator be disappointed?" If the answer is yes, then social feedback is a key value. The combination of tools, aggregation of audience, and a networked product is what is needed to unlock the hard side of these networks--it's all about the content creators.
Content creators are just one example of the hard side. There's also

hard sides that exist within marketplaces, workplace collaboration tools, multiplayer games, and other categories. Each set's motivations are idiosyncratic to the category--sellers on a marketplace might focus on creating revenue, whereas multiplayer games might be oriented around status and fun. It's important to focus on this tiny slice of users so that messaging, product functionality, and business model are all aligned to serve them. Without this group, the atomic network will collapse--a social network can't exist without its content creators, and a marketplace can't exist without its sellers.

Wikipedia's Teeny, Tiny Hard Side
The hard side of Wikipedia's network is minuscule--a mere 0.02 percent of highly motivated users create the content for the rest of the network. It's not the 1/10/100 pyramid that I quoted earlier, but something even more extreme. Attracting and retaining content creators is paramount. Their motivations might seem unusual--it's certainly not economic, as Wikipedia editors are not paid. Nor is it utility, since there are easier and simpler ways to publish content online. It would be easy and superficial to attribute their efforts to boredom, but it's not likely that.
Instead, using the frameworks presented in this chapter, I'll make an educated guess: similar to Instagram and YouTube's content creators, Wikipedia's content creators are likely motivated by the community itself. Social feedback, status, and other community dynamics encourage editors to keep creating content. Wikipedians, as they call themselves, can show their expertise in a topic by maintaining comprehensively written pages, and people within the community will thank and appreciate them. This provides status. They can make edits to correct others, which offers another form of status and satisfaction. There's teamwork and a feeling of camaraderie, which create bonds that retain users over months and years. Steven Pruitt, the wildly prolific Wikipedian, might have just a normal job during the day, but in the evenings and weekends

he is one of the most important contributors to one of the largest websites in the world.
The hard side of a network is important to understand, not just for Wikipedia, but for any new product seeking to launch its atomic network. Without this critical group, an atomic network will struggle to get off the ground. You might go so far as to say they are the most important group of users to start with, and it's important to have a thesis for why your product will appeal to them starting on day one.

SOLVE A HARD PROBLEM
Tinder
T he hardest problem to solve in creating the first atomic network is, well, attracting the hard side. Focus on attracting content creators to a new video platform, or sellers to a new marketplace, or the project managers inside a company to a new workplace app. The other side of the network will follow. The question is, how?
The answer is by building a product that solves an important need for the hard side. Let's look at online dating, which evolved over time to better solve the matchmaking problem that has bedeviled humanity since the beginning of time. Dating apps are network effects­driven products that grow city by city, and the more folks that join the network, the better the chances that people will find matches. But at the genesis of online dating, the experience was generally terrible, especially for the hard side of the network.

THE COLD START PROBLEM

The Problem of Too Many Love Letters

Online dating was invented at the beginning of the web, in the early 1990s. It was designed like newspaper classifieds, where men and women browsed large databases of profiles, and could message each other if they were interested. Match.com and JDate were successful pioneers in this category, which worked despite its flaws. The classifieds-based design created a poor product experience since the popular members-- particularly women--w ould become overwhelmed with a large number of messages, and they would struggle to reply. At a bar or club, potential suitors might be dissuaded if they saw a line of people waiting to talk to an attractive man or woman, but online, there was no such signal. So in turn, the experience for everyone else also ended up poor, because it seemed like no one would write them back.
The lesson is, unsurprisingly, that attractive people--particularly women--are the hard side of the online dating network. A few years later, the next generation of online dating would emerge, led by products like eHarmony and OKCupid. These products used quizzes and matching algorithms so that the system could decide who got which matches, and how often. This ensured women got fewer messages, and hopefully more of the right ones. And the men got more replies, too, so that it didn't feel like it was devolving into a copy-p aste messaging exercise.
It wasn't until 2012, at the beginning of the explosion in mobile apps, that yet another generation of dating apps would emerge. These apps, exemplified by Tinder, would innovate even further for the hard side of the network. I talked to Tinder's cofounder, Sean Rad, about how Tinder innovated on the previous generation of products. He described the combination of new ideas:

The older dating sites made it feel like you were doing work, like you were inside the office. You'd go and do work emails during the day, then go home and write more messages at night. Only to pro-
