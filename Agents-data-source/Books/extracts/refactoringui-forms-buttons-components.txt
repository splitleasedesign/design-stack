Balance weight and contrast

51

Making the border a bit heavier by increasing the width helps to emphasize it without losing the softer look:

Semantics are secondary
When there are multiple actions a user can take on a page, it's easy to fall into the trap of designing those actions based purely on semantics.
Semantics are an important part of button design, but that doesn't mean you can forget about hierarchy. Every action on a page sits somewhere in a pyramid of importance. Most pages only have one true primary action, a couple of less important secondary actions, and a few seldom used tertiary actions. When designing these actions, it's important to communicate their place in the hierarchy.
· Primary actions should be obvious. Solid, high contrast background colors work great here.

Semantics are secondary

53

· Secondary actions should be clear but not prominent. Outline styles or lower contrast background colors are great options.
· Tertiary actions should be discoverable but unobtrusive. Styling these actions like links is usually the best approach.

When you take a hierarchy-first approach to designing the actions on page, the result is a much less busy UI that communicates more clearly:

Semantics are secondary

54

Destructive actions
Being destructive or high severity doesn't automatically mean a button should be big, red, and bold.
If a destructive action isn't the primary action on the page, it might be better to give it a secondary or tertiary button treatment.

Combine this with a confirmation step where the destructive action actually is the primary action, and apply the big, red, bold styling there.

Layout and Spacing

Start with too much white space
One of the easiest ways to clean up a design is to simply give every element a little more room to breathe.
Sounds simple enough, right? So how come we don't usually do it?

Start with too much white space

57

White space should be removed, not added
When designing for the web, white space is almost always added to a design -- if something looks little too cramped, you add a bit of margin or padding until things look better.

The problem with this approach is that elements are only given the minimum amount of breathing room necessary to not look actively bad. To make something actually look great, you usually need more white space.

Start with too much white space

58

A better approach is to start by giving something way too much space, then remove it until you're happy with the result.

Start with too much white space

59

You might think you'd end up with too much white space this way, but in practice, what might seem like "a little too much" when focused on an individual element ends up being closer to "just enough" in the context of a complete UI.
Dense UIs have their place
While interfaces with a lot of breathing room almost always feel cleaner and simpler, there are certainly situations where it makes sense for a design to be much more compact.
For example, if you're designing some sort of dashboard where a lot of information needs to be visible at once, packing that information together so it all fits on one screen might be worth making the design feel more busy.

The important thing is to make this a deliberate decision instead of just being the default. It's a lot more obvious when you need to remove white space than it is when you need to add it.

Establish a spacing and sizing system
You shouldn't be nitpicking between 120px and 125px when trying to decide on the perfect size for an element in your UI. Painfully trialing arbitrary values one pixel at a time will drastically slow you down at best, and create ugly, inconsistent designs at worst.
Instead, limit yourself to a constrained set of values, defined in advance.

Establish a spacing and sizing system

61

A linear scale won't work
Creating a spacing and sizing system isn't quite as simple as something like "make sure everything is a multiple of 4px" -- a naive approach like that doesn't make it any easier to choose between 120px and 125px.
For a system to be truly useful, it needs to take into consideration the relative difference between adjacent values.
At the small end of the scale (like the size of an icon, or the padding inside a button), a couple of pixels can make a big difference. Jumping from 12px to 16px is an increase of 33%!

But at the large end (the width of a card, or the vertical spacing in a landing page hero), a couple of pixels is basically imperceivable. Even increasing the width of a card from 500px to 520px is only a difference of 4%, which is eight times less significant than the jump from 12px to 16px.

Establish a spacing and sizing system

62

If you want your system to make sizing decisions easy, make sure no two values in your scale are ever closer than about 25%.
Defining the system
Just like you don't want to toil over arbitrary values when sizing an element or fine-tuning the space between elements, you don't want to build your spacing and sizing scale from arbitrary values either.
A simple approach is to start with a sensible base value, then build a scale using factors and multiples of that value.
16px is a great number to start with because it divides nicely, and also happens to be the default font size in every major web browser.

Establish a spacing and sizing system

63

The values at the small end of the scale should start pretty packed together, and get progressively more spaced apart as you get further up the scale.
Here's an example of a fairly practical scale built using this approach:

Using the system
Once you've defined your spacing and sizing system, you'll find that you're able to design a hell of a lot faster, especially if you design in the browser (sticking to a system is easier when you're typing in numbers than when you're dragging with the mouse.)

Establish a spacing and sizing system

64

Need to add some space under an element? Grab a value from your scale and try it out. Not quite enough? The next value is probably perfect.
While the workflow improvements are probably the biggest benefit, you'll also start to notice a subtle consistency in your designs that wasn't there before, and things will look just a little bit cleaner.

A spacing and sizing system will help you create better designs, with less effort, in less time. Design advice doesn't get much more valuable than that.

You don't have to fill the whole screen
Remember when 960px was the de facto layout width for desktop-size designs? These days you'd be hard-pressed to find a phone with a resolution that low. So it's no surprise that when most of us open our design tool of choice on our high resolution displays, we give ourselves at least 1200-1400px of space to fill. But just because you have the space, doesn't mean you need to use it.
If you only need 600px, use 600px. Spreading things out or making things unnecessarily wide just makes an interface harder to interpret, while a little extra space around the edges never hurt anyone.

You don't have to fill the whole screen

66

This is just as applicable to individual sections of an interface, too. You don't need to make everything full-width just because something else (like your navigation) is full-width.

You don't have to fill the whole screen

67

Give each element just the space it needs -- don't make something worse just to make it match something else.
Shrink the canvas
If you're having a hard time designing a small interface on a large canvas, shrink the canvas! A lot of the time it's easier to design something small when the constraints are real.
If you're building a responsive web application, try starting with a ~400px canvas and designing the mobile layout first.

You don't have to fill the whole screen

68

Once you have a mobile design you're happy with, bring it over to a larger size screen and adjust anything that felt like a compromise on smaller screens. Odds are you won't have to change as much as you think.

Thinking in columns
If you're designing something that works best at a narrower width but feels unbalanced in the context of an otherwise wide UI, see if you can split it into columns instead of just making it wider.

You don't have to fill the whole screen

69

For example, take this narrow form layout:

You don't have to fill the whole screen

70

If you wanted to make better use of the available space without making the form harder to use, you could break the supporting text out into a separate column:

This makes the design feel more balanced and consistent without compromising on the optimal width for the form itself.

You don't have to fill the whole screen

71

Don't force it
Just like you shouldn't worry about filling the whole screen, you shouldn't try to cram everything into a small area unnecessarily either.
If you need a lot of space, go for it! Just don't feel obligated to fill it if you don't have to.

Grids are overrated
Using a system like a 12-column grid is a great way to simplify layout decisions, and can bring a satisfying sense of order to your designs.
But even though grids can be useful, outsourcing all of your layout decisions to a grid can do more harm than good.
Not all elements should be fluid
Fundamentally, a grid system is just about giving elements fluid, percentagebased widths, where you're choosing from a constrained set of percentages. For example, in a 12-column grid each column is 8.33% wide. As long as an

Grids are overrated

73

element's width is some multiple of 8.33% (including any gutters), that element is "on the grid".

The problem with treating grid systems like a religion is that there are a lot of situations where it makes much more sense for an element to have a fixed width instead of a relative width.
For example, consider a traditional sidebar layout. Using a 12-column grid system, you might give the sidebar a width of three columns (25%) and the main content area a width of nine columns (75%).

Grids are overrated

74

This might seem fine at first, but think about what happens when you resize the screen.
If you make the screen wider the sidebar gets wider too, taking up space that could've been put to better use by the main content area.

Similarly, if you make the screen narrower, the sidebar can shrink below its minimum reasonable width, causing awkward text wrapping or truncation.

In this situation, it makes much more sense to give the sidebar a fixed width that's optimized for its contents. The main content area can then flex to fill the remaining space, using its own internal grid to lay out its children.

Grids are overrated

75

This applies within components, too -- don't use percentages to size something unless you actually want it to scale.

Grids are overrated

76

Don't shrink an element until you need to
Say you're designing a login card. Using the full screen width would look ugly, so you give it a width of 6 columns (50%) with a 3-column offset on each side.

On medium-sized screens you realize the card is a little narrow even though you have the space to make it bigger, so at that screen size you switch it to a width of 8 columns, with two empty columns on each side.

Grids are overrated

77

The silly thing about this approach is that because column widths are fluid, there's a range in screen sizes where the login card is wider on medium screens than it is on large screens:

If you know that say 500px is the optimal size for the card, why should it ever get smaller than that if you have the space for it?
Instead of sizing elements like this based on a grid, give them a max-width so they don't get too large, and only force them to shrink when the screen gets smaller than that max-width.

Grids are overrated

78

Don't be a slave to the grid -- give your components the space they need and don't make any compromises until it's actually necessary.

Relative sizing doesn't scale
It's tempting to believe that every part of an interface should be sized relative to one another, and that if element A needs to shrink by 25% on smaller screens, that element B should shrink by 25%, too. For example, say you're designing an article at a large screen size. If your body copy is 18px and your headlines are 45px, it's tempting to encode that relationship by defining your headline size as 2.5em; 2.5 times the current font size.
There's nothing inherently wrong with using relative units like em, but don't be fooled into believing that relationships defined this way can remain static -- 2.5em might be the perfect headline size on desktop but there's no guarantee that it'll be the right size on smaller screens.

Relative sizing doesn't scale

80

Say you reduce the size of your body copy to 14px on small screens to keep the line length in check. Keeping your headlines at 2.5em means a rendered font size of 35px -- way too big for a small screen!

A better headline size for small screens might be somewhere between 20px and 24px:

Relative sizing doesn't scale

81

That's only 1.5-1.7x the size of the 14px body copy -- a totally different relationship than what made sense on desktop screens. That means there isn't any real relationship at all, and that there's no real benefit in trying to define the headline size relative to the body copy size.
As a general rule, elements that are large on large screens need to shrink faster than elements that are already fairly small -- the difference between small elements and large elements should be less extreme at small screen sizes.
Relationships within elements
The idea that things should scale independently doesn't just apply to sizing elements at different screen sizes; it applies to the properties of a single component, too.
Say you've designed a button. It's got a 16px font size, 16px of horizontal padding, and 12px of vertical padding:

Much like the previous example, it's tempting to think that the padding should be defined in terms of the current font size. That way if you want a larger or smaller button, you only need to change the font size and the padding will update automatically, right?

Relative sizing doesn't scale

82

This works -- the buttons do scale up or down and preserve the same proportions. But is that what we really want? Compare that to these buttons, where the padding gets more generous at larger sizes and disproportionately tighter at smaller sizes:
Here the large button actually feels like a larger button, and the small buttons actually feel like smaller buttons, not like we simply adjusted the zoom. Let go of the idea that everything needs to scale proportionately -- giving yourself the freedom to fine-tune things independently makes it a hell of a lot easier to design for multiple contexts.

Avoid ambiguous spacing
When groups of elements are explicitly separated -- usually by a border or background color -- it's obvious which elements belong to which group.
But when there isn't a visible separator, it's not always so obvious. Say you're designing a form with stacked labels and inputs. If the margin below the label is the same as the margin below the input, the elements in the form group won't feel obviously "connected".

Avoid ambiguous spacing

84

At best the user has to work harder to interpret the UI, and at worst it means accidentally putting the wrong data in the wrong field.
The fix is to increase the space between each form group so it's clear which label belongs to which input:

Avoid ambiguous spacing

85

This same problem shows up in article design when there's not enough space above section headings:

...and in bulleted lists, when the space between bullets matches the lineheight of a single bullet:

Avoid ambiguous spacing

86

It's not just vertical spacing that you have to worry about either; it's easy to make this mistake with components that are laid out horizontally, too:

Whenever you're relying on spacing to connect a group of elements, always make sure there's more space around the group than there is within it -- interfaces that are hard to understand always look worse.

Designing Text

Establish a type scale
Most interfaces use way too many font sizes. Unless a team has a rigid design system in place, it's not uncommon to find that every pixel value from 10px to 24px has been used in the UI somewhere.
Choosing font sizes without a system is a bad idea for two reasons: 1. It leads to annoying inconsistencies in your designs. 2. It slows down your workflow.
So how do you define a type system?

Establish a type scale

89

Choosing a scale
Just like with spacing and sizing, a linear scale won't work. Smaller jumps between font sizes are useful at the bottom of the scale, but you don't want to waste time deciding between 46px and 48px for a large headline.
Modular scales One approach is to calculate your type scale using a ratio, like 4:5 (a "major third"), 2:3 (a "perfect fifth"), or perhaps the "golden ratio", 1:1.618. This is often called a "modular scale".
You start with a sensible base value (16px is common since it's the default font size for most browsers), apply your ratio to get the next value, then apply your ratio to that value to get the next value, and so on and so forth:

Establish a type scale

90

The mathematical purity of this approach is alluring, but in practice, it's not perfect for a couple of reasons.
1. You end up with fractional values. Using a 16px base and 4:5 ratio, your scale will end up with lots of sizes that don't land right on the pixel, like 31.25px, 39.063px, 48.828px, etc. Browsers all handle subpixel rounding a little bit differently, so it's best to avoid fractional sizes if you can avoid it.
If you do want to use this approach, make sure you round the values yourself when defining the scale to avoid off-by-one pixel issues across browsers.
2. You usually need more sizes. This approach can work well if you're defining a type scale for long form content like an article, but for interface design, the jumps you get using a modular scale are often a bit too limiting.
With a (rounded) 3:4 type scale, you get sizes like 12px, 16px, 21px, and 28px. While this might not seem too limiting on the surface, in practice you're going to wish you had a size between 12px and 16px, and another between 16px and 21px.
You could use a tighter ratio like 8:9, but at this point you're just trying to pick a scale that happens to match the sizes you already know you want.
Hand-crafted scales For interface design, a more practical approach is to simply pick values by hand. You don't have to worry about subpixel rounding errors this way, and you have total control over which sizes exist instead of outsourcing that job to some mathematical formula.

Establish a type scale

91

Here's an example of a scale that works well for most projects and aligns nicely with the spacing and sizing scale recommended in "Establishing a spacing and sizing system":

It's constrained just enough to speed up your decision making, but isn't so limited as to make you feel like you're missing a useful size.

Establish a type scale

92

Avoid em units
When you're building a type scale, don't use em units to define your sizes.
Because em units are relative to the current font size, the computed font size of nested elements is often not actually a value in your scale.
For example, say you've defined an em-based type scale like this:

Establish a type scale

93

If you give an element a font size of 1.25em (20px by default), inside of that element 1em is now equal to 20px. That means that if you give one of the nested elements a font size of .875em, the actual computed font size is 17.5px, not a value from your type scale!
Stick to px or rem units -- it's the only way to guarantee you're actually sticking to the system.

Use good fonts
With thousands of different typefaces out there to choose from, separating the good from the bad can be an intimidating task.
Developing an eye for all of the details that make a good typeface can take years. You probably don't have years, so here are a few tricks you can use to start picking out high quality typefaces right away.
Play it safe
For UI design, your safest bet is a fairly neutral sans-serif -- think something like Helvetica. If you really don't trust your own taste, one great option is to rely on the system font stack:
-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Noto Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Helvetica Neue;

Use good fonts

95

It might not be the most ambitious choice, but at least your users will already be used to seeing it.
Ignore typefaces with less than five weights
This isn't always true, but as a general rule, typefaces that come in a lot of different weights tend to be crafted with more care and attention to detail than typefaces with fewer weights.
Many font directories (like Google Fonts) will let you filter by "number of styles", which is a combination of the available weights as well as the italic variations of those weights.
A great way to limit the number of options you have to choose from is to crank that up to 10+ (to account for italics):

Use good fonts

96

On Google Fonts specifically, that cuts out 85% of the available options, leaving you with less than 50 sans-serifs to choose from.
Optimize for legibility
When someone designs a font family, they are usually designing it for a specific purpose. Fonts meant for headlines usually have tighter letterspacing and shorter lowercase letters (a shorter x-height), while fonts meant for smaller sizes have wider letter-spacing and taller lowercase letters.

Keep this in mind and avoid using condensed typefaces with short x-heights for your main UI text.
Trust the wisdom of the crowd
If a font is popular, it's probably a good font. Most font directories will let you sort by popularity, so this can be a great way to limit your choices.
This is especially useful when you're trying to pick out something other than a neutral UI typeface. Picking a nice serif with some personality for example can be tough.

Use good fonts

97

Leveraging the collective decision-making power of thousands of other people can make it a lot easier.
Steal from people who care
Inspect some of your favorite sites and see what typefaces they are using.

Use good fonts

98

There are a lot of great design teams out there full of people with really strong opinions about typography, and they'll often choose great fonts that you might have never found using some of the safer approaches outlined above.
Developing your intuition
Once you start paying closer attention to the typography on well-designed sites, it's not long before you feel pretty comfortable labeling a typeface as awesome or terrible.
You're gonna be a type snob soon enough, but the advice outlined above will help get you by in the meantime.

Keep your line length in check
When styling paragraphs, it's easy to make the mistake of fitting the text to your layout instead of trying to create the best reading experience. Usually this means lines that are too long, making text harder to read.
For the best reading experience, make your paragraphs wide enough to fit between 45 and 75 characters per line. The easiest way to do this on the web is using em units, which are relative to the current font size. A width of 20-35em will get you in the right ballpark.

Keep your line length in check

100

Going a bit wider than 75 characters per line can sometimes work too, but be aware that you're entering risky territory -- stick to the 45-75 range if you want to play it safe.
Dealing with wider content
If you're mixing paragraph text with images or other large components, you should still limit the paragraph width even if the overall content area needs to be wider to accommodate the other elements.
