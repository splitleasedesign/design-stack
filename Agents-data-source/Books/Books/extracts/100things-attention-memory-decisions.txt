THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DESIGN
Whether you're designing a Web site or a medical device--or something somewhere in between--your audience is comprised of the people who will benefit from that design.
And the totality of your audience's experience is profoundly impacted by what you know--or don't know--about them.
How do they think? How do they decide? What motivates them to click or purchase or whatever it is you want them to do?
You'll learn those things in this book. You'll also learn what grabs their attention, what errors they will make and why, as well as other things that will help you design better. And you'll design better because I've already done most of the heavy lifting for you. I'm one of those strange people who likes to read research. Lots and lots of research. So I read--or in some cases, re-read--dozens of books and hundreds of research articles. I picked my favorite theories, concepts, and research studies. Then I combined them with experience I've gained throughout the many years I've been designing technology interfaces. And you're holding the result: 100 things I think you need to know about people.

HOW
PEOPLE
SEE
Vision trumps all the senses. Half of the brain's resources are dedicated to seeing and interpreting what we see. What our eyes physically perceive is only one part of the story. The images coming in to our brains are changed and interpreted. It's really our brains that are "seeing."

1 WHAT YOU SEE ISN'T WHAT
YOUR BRAIN GETS
You think that as you're walking around looking at the world, your eyes are sending information to your brain, which processes it and gives you a realistic experience of "what's out there." But the truth is that what your brain comes up with isn't exactly what your eyes are seeing. Your brain is constantly interpreting everything you see. Take a look at Figure 1.1, for example.
What do you see? At first you probably see a triangle with a black border in the background, and an upside-down, white triangle on top of it. Of course, that's not really what's there, is it? In reality there are merely lines and partial circles. Your brain creates the shape of an upside-down triangle out of empty space, because that's what it expects to see. This particular illusion is called a Kanizsa triangle, named for the Italian psychologist Gaetano Kanizsa, who developed it in 1955. Now look at Figure 1.2, which creates a similar illusion with a rectangle.
THE BRAIN CREATES SHORTCUTS
Your brain creates these shortcuts in order to quickly make sense out of the world around you. Your brain receives millions of sensory inputs every second (the estimate is 40 million) and it's trying to make sense of all of that input. It uses rules of thumb, based on past experience, to make guesses about what you see. Most of the time that works, but sometimes it causes errors.

FIGURE 1.1 You see triangles, but they are not really there

FIGURE 1.2 An example of a Kanizsa rectangle

2

HOW PEOPLE SEE

You can influence what people see, or think they see, by the use of shapes and colors. Figure 1.3 shows how color can draw attention to one message over another.
FIGURE 1.3 Color and shapes can influence what people see
If you need to see in the dark, don't look straight ahead.
The eye has 7 million cones that are sensitive to bright light and 125 million rods that are sensitive to low light. The cones are in the fovea (central area of vision) and rods are less central. So if you're in low light, you'll see better if you don't look right at the area you're trying to see.
Optical illusions show us the errors
Optical illusions are examples of how the brain misinterprets what the eyes see. For example, in Figure 1.4 the line on the left looks longer than the line on the right, but they're actually the same length. Named for Franz Müller-Lyer, who created it in 1889, this is one of the oldest optical illusions.

FIGURE 1.4 These lines are actually the same length

1 WHAT YOU SEE ISN'T WHAT YOUR BRAIN GETS

We see in 2D, not 3D
Light rays enter the eye through the cornea and lens. The lens focuses an image on the retina. On the retina it is always a two-dimensional representation, even if it is a threedimensional object. This image is sent to the visual cortex in the brain, and that's where recognition of patterns takes place, for example, "Oh, I recognize that as a door." The visual cortex turns the 2D image into a 3D representation.
The visual cortex puts all the information together
According to John Medina (2009), the retina receives electrical patterns from what we look at and creates several tracks from the patterns. Some tracks contain information about shadows, others about movement, and so on. As many as 12 tracks of information are then sent to the brain's visual cortex. There, different regions respond to and process the information. For example, one area responds only to lines that are tilted to 40 degrees, another only to color, another only to motion, and another only to edges. Eventually all of these data get combined into just two tracks: one for movement (is the object moving?) and another for location (where is this object in relation to me?).
Takeaways
What you think people are going to see on your Web page may not be what they do see. It might depend on their background, knowledge, familiarity with what they are looking at, and expectations. You might be able to persuade people to see things in a certain way, depending on how they are presented.

HOW PEOPLE SEE

2 PERIPHERAL VISION IS USED MORE
THAN CENTRAL VISION TO GET THE GIST OF WHAT YOU SEE
You have two types of vision: central and peripheral. Central vision is what you use to look at things directly and to see details. Peripheral vision encompasses the rest of the visual field--areas that are visible, but that you're not looking at directly. Being able to see things out of the corner of your eye is certainly useful, but new research from Kansas State University shows that peripheral vision is more important in understanding the world around us than most people realize. It seems that we get information on what type of scene we're looking at from our peripheral vision.
Why blinking on a screen is so annoying
People can't help but notice movement in their peripheral vision. For example, if you're reading text on a computer screen, and there's some animation or something blinking off to the side, you can't help but look at it. This can be quite annoying if you're trying to concentrate on reading the text in front of you. This is peripheral vision at work! This is why advertisers use blinking and flashing in the ads that are at the periphery of web pages. Even though we may find it annoying, it does get our attention.
Adam Larson and Lester Loschky (2009) showed people photographs of common scenes, such as a kitchen or a living room. In some of the photographs the outside of the image was obscured, and in others the central part of the image was obscured. The images were shown for very short amounts of time, and were purposely shown with a gray filter so they were somewhat hard to see (see Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2). Then they asked the research participants to identify what they were looking at.
Larson and Loschky found that if the central part of the photo was missing, people could still identify what they were looking at. But when the peripheral part of the image was missing, then they couldn't say whether the scene was a living room or a kitchen. They tried obscuring different amounts of the photo. They concluded that central vision is the most critical for specific object recognition, but peripheral vision is used for getting the gist of a scene.

FIGURE 2.1 A central vision photo used in Larson and Loschky research

FIGURE 2.2 A peripheral vision photo used in Larson and Loschky research

Peripheral vision kept our ancestors alive on the savannah
The theory, from an evolutionary standpoint, is that early humans who were sharpening their flint, or looking up at the clouds, and yet still noticed that a lion was coming at them in their peripheral vision survived to pass on their genes. Those with poor peripheral vision didn't survive to pass on genes.
Recent research confirms this idea. Dimitri Bayle (2009) placed pictures of fearful objects in subjects' peripheral vision or central vision. Then he measured how long it took for the amygdala (the emotional part of the brain that responds to fearful images) to react. When the fearful object was shown in the central vision, it took between 140 to 190 milliseconds for the amygdala to react. But when objects were shown in peripheral vision, it only took 80 milliseconds for the amygdala to react.

Takeaways
People use peripheral vision when they look at a computer screen, and usually decide what a page is about based on a quick glimpse of what is in their peripheral vision.
Although the middle of the screen is important for central vision, don't ignore what is in the viewers' peripheral vision. Make sure the information in the periphery communicates clearly the purpose of the page and the site.
If you want users to concentrate on a certain part of the screen, don't put animation or blinking elements in their peripheral vision.

HOW PEOPLE SEE

3 PEOPLE IDENTIFY OBJECTS BY
RECOGNIZING PATTERNS
Recognizing patterns helps you make quick sense of the sensory input that comes to you every second. Your eyes and brain want to create patterns, even if there are no real patterns there. In Figure 3.1, you probably see four sets of two dots each rather than eight individual dots. You interpret the white space, or lack of it, as a pattern.
FIGURE 3.1 Your brain wants to see patterns
Individual cells respond to certain shapes
In 1959 David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel showed that some cells in the visual cortex respond only to horizontal lines, others respond only to vertical lines, others respond only to edges, and still others respond only to certain angles.
THE GEON THEORY OF OBJECT RECOGNITION
There have been many theories over the years about how we see and recognize objects. An early theory was that the brain has a memory bank that stores millions of objects, and when you see an object, you compare it with all the items in your memory bank until you find the one that matches. But research now suggests that you recognize basic shapes in what you are looking at, and use these basic shapes, called geometric icons (or geons), to identify objects. Irving Biederman came up with the idea of geons in 1985 (Figure 3.2). It's thought that there are 24 basic shapes that we recognize; they form the building blocks of all the objects we see and identify.
The visual cortex is more active when you are imagining
The visual cortex is more active when you are imagining something than when you are actually perceiving it (Solso, 2005). Activity occurs in the same location in the visual cortex, but there is more activity when we imagine. The theory is that the visual cortex has to work harder since the stimulus is not actually present.

Takeaways
Use patterns as much as possible, since people will automatically be looking for them. Use grouping and white space to create patterns.
If you want people to recognize an object (for example, an icon), use a simple geometric drawing of the object. This will make it easier to recognize the underlying geons, and thus make the object easier and faster to recognize.
Favor 2D elements over 3D ones. The eyes communicate what they see to the brain as a 2D object. 3D representations on the screen may actually slow down recognition and comprehension.

HOW PEOPLE SEE

4 THERE'S A SPECIAL PART OF THE
BRAIN JUST FOR RECOGNIZING FACES
Imagine that you're walking down a busy street in a large city when you suddenly see the face of a family member. Even if you were not expecting to see this person, and even if there are dozens, or even hundreds, of people in your visual field, you will immediately recognize him or her as your relative. You'll also have an accompanying emotional response, be it love, hate, fear, or otherwise.
Although the visual cortex is huge and takes up significant brain resources, there is a special part of the brain outside the visual cortex whose sole purpose is to recognize faces. Identified by Nancy Kanwisher (1997), the fusiform face area (FFA) allows faces to bypass the brain's usual interpretive channels and helps us identify them more quickly than objects. The FFA is also near the amygdala, the brain's emotional center.
People with autism don't view faces with the FFA
Research by Karen Pierce (2001) showed that people with autism don't use the FFA when looking at faces. Instead, they use other, regular pathways in the brain and visual cortex that are normally used to recognize and interpret objects but not faces.

We look where the face looks

Eye-tracking research shows that if a picture of a face looks away from us and toward a product on a Web page (see Figure 4.1), then we tend to also look at the product.
But remember, just because people look at something doesn't mean they're paying attention. As you consider your Web approach, you'll have to decide whether you want to establish an emotional connection (the face looking right at the user) or direct attention (the face looking directly at a product).

FIGURE 4.1 We look where the person looks

4 THERE'S A SPECIAL PART OF THE BRAIN JUST FOR RECOGNIZING FACES

9

People are born with a preference for faces
Research by Catherine Mondloch et al. (1999) shows that newborns less than an hour old prefer looking at something that has facial features.
The eyes have it: people decide who and what is alive by looking at the eyes
Christine Looser and T. Wheatley (2010) takes pictures of people and then morphs them in stages into inanimate mannequin faces. She shows the stages and has research subjects decide when the picture is no longer a human and alive. Figure 4.2 shows examples of her pictures. Looser's research found that subjects say the pictures no longer show someone who is alive at about the 75 percent mark. She also found that people primarily use the eyes to decide if a picture shows someone who is human and alive.
FIGURE 4.2 An example of Looser's and Wheatley's people to mannequin faces
Takeaways
People recognize and react to faces on Web pages faster than anything else on the page (at least by those who are not autistic). Faces looking right at people will have the greatest emotional impact on a Web page, probably because the eyes are the most important part of the face. If a face on a Web page looks at another spot or product on the page, people will also tend to look at that product. This doesn't necessarily mean that they paid attention to it, just that they physically looked at it.

5 PEOPLE IMAGINE OBJECTS TILTED AND
AT A SLIGHT ANGLE ABOVE
If you ask someone to draw a picture of a coffee cup, chances are they'll draw something that looks something like Figure 5.1.
FIGURE 5.1 How we "see" objects in our heads In fact, Stephen Palmer (1981) traveled around the world and asked people to draw a
coffee cup. Figure 5.2 shows examples of what they drew.
FIGURE 5.2 What most people drew when asked to draw a coffee cup 5 PEOPLE IMAGINE OBJECTS TILTED AND AT A SLIGHT ANGLE ABOVE 11

What's interesting about these drawings is the angle and perspective. A few of the cups are sketched straight on, but most are drawn from a perspective slightly above the cup looking down, and offset a little to the right or left. This has been dubbed the canonical perspective. Very few people would draw a coffee cup as in Figure 5.3, which is what you'd see if you were looking at a coffee cup from above.
Of course not, you say, but...why not? You might argue that the first perspective is the one that you actually see most of the time when you look at a coffee cup, but I will tell you that this research has been done on many objects, and people most quickly recognized them all at this same canonical perspective, even though they don't look at all of these objects from above most of the time. The research asked people to identify various animals, such as a very small dog or cat. The canonical perspective still won out, even though we most often see cats or very small dogs from high above, not just slightly above (unless you crawl around on the ground a lot). It seems to be a universal trait that we think about, remember, imagine, and recognize objects from this canonical perspective.
FIGURE 5.3 Most people don't draw a coffee cup like this
Takeaways
People recognize a drawing or object faster and remember it better if it's shown in the canonical perspective. If you have icons at your Web site or in your Web or software application, draw them from a canonical perspective.
12 HOW PEOPLE SEE

6 PEOPLE SCAN SCREENS BASED ON
PAST EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS

Where do people look first on a computer screen? Where do they look next? It depends partially on what they're doing and expecting. If they read in a language that moves from left to right, then they tend to look at the screen from left to right. If they read from right to left, it is the opposite. However, they don't start in the topmost corner. Because people have gotten used to the idea that there are things on computer screens that are less relevant to the task at hand, such as logos, blank space, and navigation bars (see Figure 6.1), they tend to look at the center of the screen and avoid the edges.

People don't look at screen edges

People consider the point where the meaningful informaton begins to be the true "top left"

FIGURE 6.1 We skip the edges of a screen and move to meaningful information
After a first glance at a screen, people move in their culture's normal reading pattern (left to right, right to left, top to bottom). If something grabs their attention, for example, a large photo (especially one with someone's face) or movement (an animated banner or video) somewhere else on the screen, then you can pull them away from this normal tendency.
6 PEOPLE SCAN SCREENS BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS 13

PEOPLE HAVE A MENTAL MODEL OF WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE AND WHERE THEY WANT TO SEE IT
People have a mental model of where things tend to be on computer screens, and a mental model for particular applications or Web sites that they use. They tend to look at a screen based on these mental models. For example, if they shop at Amazon a lot and use the search field, they'll likely look right at the search field when the screen loads.
IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, PEOPLE NARROW THEIR VIEW
If there is an error or unexpected problem with the task people are trying to accomplish, then they stop looking at other parts of the screen and focus on the problem area. We'll discuss this more in the "People Make Mistakes" chapter.
Takeaways
Put the most important information (or things you want people to focus on) in the top third of the screen or in the middle. Avoid putting anything important at the edges, since people tend not to look there. Design the screen or page so that people can move in their normal reading pattern. Avoid a pattern where people have to bounce back and forth to many parts of the screen to accomplish a task.

7 PEOPLE SEE CUES THAT TELL THEM
WHAT TO DO WITH AN OBJECT
You've probably had the experience of encountering a door handle that doesn't work the way it should: the handle looks like you should pull, but in fact you need to push. In the real world, objects communicate to you about how you can, and should, interact with them. For example, by their size and shape, doorknobs invite you to grab and turn them. The handle on a coffee mug tells you to curl a few fingers through it and lift it up. A pair of scissors invites you to put fingers through the circles and move your thumb up and down to open and close. If the item, like the door handle, gives you cues that don't work, you get annoyed and frustrated. These cues are called affordances.
James Gibson wrote about the idea of affordance in 1979. He described affordances as action possibilities in the environment. In 1988 Don Norman modified the idea of affordances in his book The Design of Everyday Things. He referred to the idea of perceived affordances: if you want people to take action on an object, whether in real life or on a computer screen, you need to make sure that they can easily perceive, figure out, and interpret what the object is and what they can and should do with it.
When you try to accomplish a task, such as opening a door to a room or ordering a book at a Web site, you automatically, and largely unconsciously, look around you to find objects and tools to help you. If you are the one designing the environment for the task, make sure that the objects in the environment are easy to see, easy to find, and have clear affordances.
Take a look at the door handle in Figure 7.1. Because of its shape, you'll tend to grab it and pull down. If that's the way it works, then you'd say that the door handle is well designed and that it has a clear perceived affordance.
FIGURE 7.1 This door handle invites you to grab and pull down

Figure 7.2 shows a handle shaped in a way that invites you to grab and pull, but the PUSH sign indicates the door simply doesn't work that way. That's known as incorrect affordance.
FIGURE 7.2 This door handle reads PUSH but its design encourages you to pull
PERCEIVED AFFORDANCES ON COMPUTER SCREENS
When you're designing an application or Web site, think about the affordances of objects on the screen. For example, have you ever wondered what makes people want to click on a button? Cues in the button's shadow tell people that it can be pushed in, the way a button on an actual device can be pushed in.
Figure 7.3 shows a button on a remote control. The shape and shadows give you cues that encourage you to press the button to activate it.
FIGURE 7.3 Buttons on physical devices have shadows that make you want to press them 16 HOW PEOPLE SEE

You can simulate these shadows online, too. In Figure 7.4, shadows of different colors around the edges make the button look pushed in. Try turning the book upside down and looking at the same button. Now it will look like it's not pushed in, and the shadows will give cues to push the button.

FIGURE 7.4 This button looks pushed in, but turn the book upside down and see what happens
These visual cues are subtle, but they are important. Many buttons on Web sites have some of these visual cues, such as the button in Figure 7.5, but lately Web sites are losing the cues. In Figure 7.6, the button is just text in a colored square.

FIGURE 7.5 The use of shading makes this look like a button

FIGURE 7.6 Online buttons are losing their cues

HYPERLINKS ARE LOSING THEIR AFFORDANCE CUES
Most people have figured out the affordance cue that blue, underlined text means that the text is hyperlinked, and if you click on it you will go to a different page. But lately many hyperlinks are more subtle, with the only cue that they are clickable showing up when you hover. Figure 7.7 shows what the New York Times Reader page looks like before you hover, and Figure 7.8 shows what it looks like when you hover. It takes an extra step to see the cues. And if you are reading on your iPad, all of these cues are missing. You can't hover with your finger on an iPad. By the time you've touched the screen with your finger, you've clicked on the link.

FIGURE 7.8 In Times Reader, affordance cues show up when you hover

Takeaways
Think about affordance cues when you design. By giving people cues about what they can do with a particular object, you make it more likely that they will take that action.
Use shading to show when an object is chosen or active.
Avoid providing incorrect affordance cues.
Rethink hover cues if you're designing for a device that uses touch rather than a pointing device.

THEIR VISUAL FIELDS
Spoiler Alert
If you haven't seen what is famously called the "Gorilla video," then you should check this out now. Go to my blog:
http://www.whatmakesthemclick.net/2009/10/25/100-things-you-shouldknow-about-people-1-inattention-blindness/ Take the test. If you don't do this now, then I'm going to spoil the effect for you below as I discuss the video.
The "Gorilla video" is an example of inattention blindness or change blindness. The idea is that people often miss large changes in their visual fields. This has been shown in many experiments, although the basketball/gorilla experiment is the most well known. (Videos from some of the other experiments are at my blog at the URL above.)
In their book, The Invisible Gorilla, Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons (2010) describe additional research they did with eye-tracking equipment. Eye tracking is a technology that can track where someone is looking. More specifically, it tracks where the foveal or central gaze is. It doesn't track peripheral vision. Eye-tracking research done while people are watching the basketball/gorilla video shows that everyone watching the video "sees" the gorilla in the video, meaning that their eyes are looking at the gorilla, but only 50 percent are aware that they have seen the gorilla. Chabris and Simons have conducted many studies on this phenomenon, and they have concluded that if you are paying attention to one thing, and you don't expect changes to appear, then you can easily miss changes that do occur.
Eye-tracking data can be misleading
Eye tracking is a technology that allows you to see and record what a person is looking at, in what order, and for how long. It is often used to study Web sites to see where people are looking, including where they look first, second, and so on. One of its benefits is that you don't have to rely on what people say they are looking at, but instead you can
8 PEOPLE CAN MISS CHANGES IN THEIR VISUAL FIELDS 19

collect the data directly. But eye-tracking data can be misleading for several reasons: 1) As we've discussed in this section, eye tracking tells you what people looked at, but that doesn't mean that they paid attention to it. 2) The Larson and Loschky research in this chapter tells us that peripheral vision is just as important as central vision. Eye tracking measures only central vision. 3) Early eye-tracking research by Alfred Yarbus (1967) showed that what people look at depends on what questions they are asked while they are looking. It's therefore easy to accidently skew the eye-tracking data depending on what instructions you give them before and during the eye tracking study.
Takeaways
Don't assume that people will see something on a computer screen just because it's there. This is especially true when you refresh a screen and make one change on it. Users may not even realize they are even looking at a different screen. If you want to be sure that people notice a change in their visual fields, add additional visual cues (such as blinking) or auditory cues (such as a beep). Be cautious about how you interpret eye-tracking data. Don't ascribe too much importance to it or use it as the main basis for design decisions.

9 PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THINGS THAT ARE
CLOSE TOGETHER BELONG TOGETHER
If two items are near each other (a photo and text for example), then people assume they go together. This connection is strongest for items that are together left to right. In Figure 9.1, the photo goes with the text below it. But because we read left to right, and because there is very little space between the photo and the text to the right, we may expect that the photo and the text to the right belong together.
FIGURE 9.1 You might assume that this photo belongs with the text to the right because they are close together and we read from left to right. But in this example, the photo actually goes with the text below it--and that will be confusing to most readers.
Takeaways
If you want items (pictures, photos, headings, or text) to be seen as belonging together, then put them in close proximity. Before you use lines or boxes to separate items or group them together, try experimenting with the amount of space between them first. Sometimes changing the spacing is sufficient, and you'll be reducing the visual noise of the page. Put more space between items that don't go together and less space between items that do. This sounds like common sense, but many Web page layouts ignore this idea.

HARD ON THE EYES
When lines or text of different colors are projected or printed, the depths of the lines may appear to be different. One color may jump out while another color appears recessed. This effect is called chromostereopsis. The effect is strongest with red and blue, but it can also happen with other colors, for example, red and green. These color combinations can be hard and tiring to look at or read. Figure 10.1 shows some examples of chromostereopsis.
FIGURE 10.1 Chromostereopsis can be hard on the eyes

Avoid putting blue and red or green and red near each other on a page or screen. Avoid blue or green text on a red background, and red or green text on a blue background.

11 NINE PERCENT OF MEN AND
ONE-HALF PERCENT OF WOMEN ARE COLOR-BLIND
The term color blindness is actually a misnomer. Most people who are "color-blind" are not blind to all colors, but really have a color deficiency that makes it hard for them to see differences between some colors. Most color blindness is hereditary, although some can be acquired through disease or injury. Most of the color genes are on the X chromosome. Since men have only one X chromosome and women have two, men are more likely to have problems with color vision than women.
There are many different kinds of color blindness, but the most common is a difficulty distinguishing between reds, yellows, and greens. This is called "red-green" color blindness. Other forms, such as problems distinguishing blues from yellows, or where everything looks gray, are very rare.
Figure 11.1 shows a map of winter driving conditions from the Wisconsin Department of Transportation's Web site as it appears to someone who has no color blindness. Figure 11.2 shows the same page as a person with red-green color blindness would see it, and Figure 11.3 shows the same page as a person with blue-yellow color deficiency would see it. Notice that the colors are different.
The rule of thumb is that wherever you use color to give specific meaning, you need a redundant coding scheme, for example, color and line thickness, so that people who are color-blind will be able to decipher the code without needing to see specific colors.

ous types of color blindness. Figure 11.4, Figure 11.5, and Figure 11.6 are from a Web site that shows the spread of influenza for a particular week. At this site they have purposely picked colors that look the same for people regardless of the type of color blindness they have, and even if they are not color-blind. The three instances of the Web page look almost exactly the same.

Use Web sites to check for color blindness effects
There are several sites you can use to check how your images or Web site will appear to someone who has color blindness. Here are two I recommend: www.vischeck.com colorfilter.wickline.org
Those who are color-blind can often see camouflage better
Some say it is because they are not distracted by color, while others say it is because those who are color-blind are used to looking for pattern, texture, or other cues. Regardless of the reason, some color-blind individuals can see camouflage better than those who have full-color vision.
Takeaways
Check your images and Web sites with www.vischeck.com or colorfilter.wickline.org to see how they will look to someone who is color-blind. If you use color to imply a certain meaning (for example, items in green need immediate attention), use a redundant coding scheme (items in green and with a box around them need immediate attention). When designing color coding, consider colors that work for everyone, for example, varying shades of brown and yellow. Avoid red, green, and blue.

12 THE MEANINGS OF COLORS
VARY BY CULTURE
Many years ago I worked with a client who had created a color map of the different business regions for their company, showing the total revenue for the quarter for each region. Yellow was for the eastern part of the U.S., green for the central states, and red for the western states. The VP of Sales got to the podium and started his slide show to the financial and accounting staff of the company. Up came the colored map and a gasp could be heard in the auditorium, followed by the buzz of urgent conversation. The VP tried to continue his talk, but he had lost everyone's attention. They were all talking amongst themselves.
Finally someone blurted out, "What the heck is going on in the West?" "What do you mean?" the VP asked. "Nothing is going on. They had a great quarter." To an accountant or financial person, red is a bad thing. It means that they are losing money. The presenter had to explain that he had just randomly picked red. Colors have associations and meanings, for example, red means "in the red" or financial trouble, or it could mean danger or stop. Green means money or "go." Pick colors carefully since they have these meanings. And different colors might mean different things to subgroups. If you are designing for people in different parts of the world, then you have to also consider the color meanings in other cultures. A few colors have similar meanings everywhere (gold, for example, stands for success and high quality in most cultures), but most colors have different meanings in different cultures. For example, in the U.S. white signifies purity and is used at weddings, but in other cultures white is the color used for death and funerals. Happiness is associated with white, green, yellow, or red, depending on the part of the world you are in.

Research on color and moods
Research shows that colors affect mood. The restaurant and hospitality industry has studied this a lot. For example, in the U.S. orange makes people agitated, so they won't stay long (useful in fast food restaurants). Browns and blues are soothing, so people will stay (useful in bars). However, in order for a color to affect mood, the person has to be sitting in a room surrounded by that color. The effect does not seem to work if he or she is simply looking at a computer screen that has a particular color on it.
Takeaways
Choose your colors carefully, taking into account the meaning that the colors may invoke. Pick a few major cultures or countries that you will be reaching with your design and check them on the cultural color chart from InformationIsBeautiful.net to be sure you're avoiding unintended color associations for that culture.

HOW
PEOPLE
READ
With adult literacy rates now over 80 percent worldwide, reading is a primary form of communication for most people. But how do we read? And what should designers know about reading?

13 IT'S A MYTH THAT CAPITAL LETTERS
ARE INHERENTLY HARD TO READ
You've probably heard that words in uppercase letters are harder to read than those in mixed case or lowercase. You've probably even heard some kind of percentage cited, such as "between 14 and 20 percent harder." The story goes that we read by recognizing the shapes of words and groups of words. Words in mixed case or lowercase letters have unique shapes. Words in all capital letters have the same shape--a rectangle of a certain size--so, in theory, they're harder to distinguish (Figure 13.1).
FIGURE 13.1 The word shape theory
This explanation sounds plausible, but it's not really accurate. There's no research showing that the shapes of words help us read more accurately or more quickly. A psycholinguist named James Cattell came up with that idea in 1886. There was some evidence for it then, but more recent work by Kenneth Paap (1984) and Keith Rayner (1998) has revealed that what we're actually doing when we read is recognizing and anticipating letters. And then, based on the letters, we recognize the word. Let's look more closely at how we read.
READING ISN'T AS FLUID AS IT SEEMS
When we read, we have the impression that our eyes are moving smoothly across the page, but that's not what's actually happening. Our eyes move in quick, sharp jumps, with short periods of stillness in between. The jumps are called saccades (about seven to nine letters at a time) and the moments of stillness are called fixations (about 250 milliseconds long). During the saccades, we can't see anything--we're essentially blind--but the movements are so fast that we don't even realize they're happening. Our eyes look forward during most of the saccades, but they look backward 10 to 15 percent of the time, rereading letters and words.
30 HOW PEOPLE READ

Figure 13.2 shows an example of the saccade and fixation pattern. The black dots are the fixations and the curved lines are the saccade movements.
Fortunately these saccades are really fast so you are not blind for long.
They are so fast that you don't even realize they are happening. FIGURE 13.2 An example of a saccade and fixation pattern
We use peripheral vision when we read
A saccade spans about seven to nine letters, but our perceptual span is actually double that. In 1996, Kenneth Goodman found that we use peripheral vision to see what comes next when we read. We read ahead about 15 letters at a time, viewing the characters to the right (assuming we're reading left to right), although now and then a saccade jumps us backward and we reread a group of letters. Although we read ahead about 15 letters at a time, we only get the meaning for part of that span. We pick up the semantic cues of letters 1 through 7, but merely recognize letters 8 through 15.
Reading music is similar to reading text
People who read music fluently use the same saccades, fixations, and reading ahead of 15 "letters" that they do when reading text.
SO, IS ALL CAPITALS HARDER TO READ THEN?
We do actually read uppercase letters more slowly, but only because we don't see them as often. Most of what we read is in mixed case, so we're used to it. If you practice reading text in all capital letters, you'll eventually read that text as fast as you read mixed case. This doesn't mean you should start using capital letters for all your text. Since peole are unused to reading that way, it will slow them down. And these days, text in all caps is perceived as "shouting" (Figure 13.3).

FIGURE 13.3 We perceive uppercase letters as shouting, but they aren't inherently harder to read
13 IT'S A MYTH THAT CAPITAL LETTERS ARE INHERENTLY HARD TO READ 31

A Good Summary Of The Research On Uppercase
Kevin Larson wrote a great article summarizing the research on uppercase versus mixed case: http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition.aspx
Takeaways
People perceive all capitals as shouting, and they're unused to reading them, so use all uppercase sparingly. Save all capital letters for headlines, and when you need to get someone's attention, for example, before deleting an important file.

If you're a biologist, then this paragraph might make sense right away: The regulation of the TCA cycle is largely determined by substrate availability and
product inhibition. NADH, a product of all of the dehydrogenases in the TCA cycle, with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, while succinyl-CoA inhibits succinylCoA synthetase and citrate synthase.
If you're not a biologist, then it might take you a long time to understand what that paragraph says. You can read the paragraph, but that doesn't mean you understand it. New information is assimilated more thoroughly when it is plugged into existing cognitive structures.

You can calculate the readability of your text

The Flesch-Kincaid formula is commonly used to calculate the readability of text. It provides both a reading ease score and a reading grade-level score. The higher the scores, the easier the passage is to read. Low scores mean the passage is hard to read. The formula is shown in Figure 14.1.

WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF WHAT YOU READ DEPENDS ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW
In a study by Anderson and Pichert (1978), people read a story about a house and the contents within the house. One group was told to read the story from a buyer's standpoint, and another group was told to read the story from a burglar's point of view. The information they remembered after reading the story differed depending on their viewpoint.
Takeaways
People are active readers. What they understand and remember from what they read depends on their previous experience, their point of view while reading, and the instructions they are given beforehand. Don't assume that people will remember specific information in what they read. Provide a meaningful title or headline. It's one of the most important things you can do. Tailor the reading level of your text to your audience. Use simple words and fewer syllables to make your material accessible to a wider audience.

15 PATTERN RECOGNITION HELPS
PEOPLE IDENTIFY LETTERS IN DIFFERENT FONTS
People have been debating which fonts are better, easier to read, or most appropriate for centuries. One such debate centers around the use of two types of fonts: serif versus sans serif. Some argue that sans serif typefaces are easier to read because they are plain; others contend that serif fonts are easier to read because the serifs draw the eye toward the next letter. In fact, research shows no difference in comprehension, reading speed, or preference between serif and sans serif fonts.
People identify letters through pattern recognition
How is it that you can recognize all of the marks in Figure 15.1 as the letter A?
FIGURE 15.1 We can recognize many variations of a letter
You haven't memorized all of these versions of the letter A. Instead you've formed a memory pattern of what an A looks like. When you see something similar, your brain recognizes the pattern. (See the discussion of geons in the chapter called "How We See" for more information about how we recognize shapes.)
Designers use fonts to evoke a mood, brand, or association. Some font families invoke a time period (old fashioned versus modern), while others convey seriousness or playfulness. In terms of readability, however, the font you choose is not critical as long as it is not so decorative as to make it hard to identify the letters; some fonts interfere with the brain's ability to recognize patterns.
Figure 15.2 shows different decorative fonts. The first font is relatively easy to read; the others become progressively more difficult. They make it hard for the brain to recognize the patterns of the letters.
