Praise for Articulating Design Decisions
Articulating Design Decisions is a must-read for anyone involved in design, whether it's product, software, or brand design. And by involved, I mean having any part of it. This is a book that's helpful to engineers, product managers, and executives as much as it is to designers.
­ Christian Manzella, Senior Director and Head of UX, Samsung
Articulating Design Decisions by Tom Greever will change the way designers talk about design. Get it, read it.
­ Tim O'Reilly, Founder and CEO, O'Reilly Media
Tom has done a great job tackling one of the more difficult aspects of design: talking to others who aren't designers and sharing the how and why of the design decisions that you made.
­ Aaron Irizarry, Head of Credit Solutions Design, Capital One, and author of Discussing Design
While most books on design mention these communication issues as a sidebar or a footnote, Tom gives us an entire book of tried and tested tools to make designers expert communicators. True to its title it is easy to read and even easier to recommend. I'm thrilled that Tom has given us this gem of a book.
­ Richard Banfield, VP of Design Transformation, InVision, and author of Design Leadership

Tom's book is essential reading for designers looking to be in control of how their work is consumed by stakeholders and clients. This book is an easy-to read guide with applicable tips to articulating product decisions with authenticity, confidence, and clarity.
­ Christy Ennis-Kloote, Design Principal, OpenDigital
Articulating Design Decisions will give you an applicable framework to learn how to best present your design work to your stakeholders and clients. It is full of real-life examples and stories that makes it very engaging.
­ Cynthia Savard Saucier, Director of UX, Shopify
Being able to "give good meeting" is a superpower. Especially for designers, who too often presume that the most important thing about a meeting with stakeholders is the design work they bring to the table. Tom shows from experience that the success of this kind of meeting, in fact, depends more on stakeholders being able to understand what they're being shown. This book provides the frameworks, planning steps, vocabulary, and (if you need them) ready-to-use paragraphs of well-formed and aptly phrased expressions in the English language that designers need to begin explaining how their work solves real problems, makes things easy for users, and deserves support from the organization.
­ Dan Klyn, Information Architect and Cofounder, The Understanding Group (TUG)

Articulating Design Decisions elegantly tackles the challenge of communicating design decisions by providing a simple approach that can allow designers (and teams!) to get alignment on their designs. It is not enough to just make the design; you need to communicate the why behind the decision and frame it in the context of the problem it intends to solve. Every designer, and product team member for that matter, could benefit from this.
­ C. Todd Lombardo, VP of Product, MachineMetrics, and coauthor of Design Sprint and Product Roadmaps Relaunched
Whether you're a designer, developer, product manager, content strategist, information architect, or marketing or sales professional, chances are you've had to present design ideas to stakeholders at one point or another. It's hard. Everyone has an opinion about what you're presenting. And they should--what you're building reflects on the brand and is one of the primary modes for customers or consumers to interact with your company. People you work with care because they have a stake in the success of the things that you design. If you want to get better at talking about, presenting, and getting buy-in for those things, this book is an excellent place to start. Tom Greever identifies tactics and solutions for tackling tough organizational challenges that will help you not just do better work, but get that work recognized and where you want it most: to market.

[ Preface ]
In 2014, I was asked to submit some talk ideas for a regional UX conference in the United States. At the time, I had been working as a design consultant for some pretty large brands and was anxious to share some of the cool work we had done together. I submitted three abstracts. The first two were about design techniques and approaches that I thought were interesting, methods we had used on projects to achieve effective design results. I was excited about those. The other one was on articulating design decisions. That one seemed mundane. Sure, it was important, but it was something I'd done every day of my career. I knew other designers had to deal with this problem too. It's just part of the job, right? It seemed like the most obvious and boring topic, something I did automatically, almost without thinking. Naturally, that's the one they chose. While I was disappointed that I wouldn't be able to share about the other topics, I put my best effort into trying to come up with a few ideas and principles that might help designers in this area. I spent several weeks thinking about how I communicate to people about design, what sort of approaches I take, and how I could help others improve with practical tips. I never anticipated that this one conference talk would kick off a series of opportunities that has completely changed my career. That process allowed me to see how my own work was filled with examples where better communication yielded better design. I realized that all my favorite designers were people who could intelligently explain why they did what they did. I noticed that a lot of the feedback I give my own team has more to do with the way they present their work than it does with their skill at creating it. It has since become clear to me that the way we talk about design with others has a significant impact on whether we succeed at creating great experiences. This is a skill

many designers (even senior designers) lack. The success of our work depends on our ability to get support from everyone on the team. If we can't do that, our designs will never see the light of day.
Talking My Way Into Design
My path to working in UX began in marketing. I studied business for my undergraduate degree and quickly saw how powerful design was in bringing products to life. All throughout college, I taught myself graphic and web design while doing freelance projects for local small businesses to pay my way through school.
I know it sounds crazy, but I really enjoy interviewing for jobs. In college, I applied for just about anything and said yes to every interview. It was a low-risk opportunity to practice talking about my work. I loved watching people look through my portfolio, comment on what they liked, or ask me questions about why I did what I did. I got a rush from telling other people about my design decisions back then; I still do today. I love to talk about design!
After graduation, I was interviewing for a role as the creative manager on an internal marketing team of about twenty people. My last interview was with the vice president of marketing. She quizzed me on my portfolio, which I easily defended. She asked me about my past experience and ran through my resume, which I gladly bragged about. But then she got down to the point and asked me the most memorable question of my career: "Let's say I have a new project for you. What's the first thing you would ask me about it?"
It seemed like an easy answer. I only had limited experience, but this was perhaps the most common meeting for a designer: the meeting with a stakeholder. Without hesitating, I began what felt like a triedand-true approach to all my previous work: "Is this a print piece or a website? Will it be color or black and white? Will we use stock photography or original? How many pages would the website or brochure have? And, finally, what is your timeline?"
"You're wrong," she said. "None of that really matters. The most important thing you could ask me...the very first thing you should always ask is, `What are we trying to communicate?'"
| xii  Preface

I was stumped. Silent. Not only did I know that she was right, but she had exposed my superficial design ego in a way that made me feel small and completely clueless about the thing that I was most confident in-- my ability to talk about design.
The good news is I got that job, and I've had many other jobs since then, but I never forgot that mistake. I was not astute enough to recognize that my stakeholder had a different agenda than my own. I failed to understand what she needed or to address her concerns. To her, the project was about communication. To me, it was only about pixels. In that moment, I realized that my ability to talk to other people about design was critical. I had to take into consideration the needs of my audience. My designs had to do something for the client. They had to solve a problem. And if I couldn't communicate that, I was bound to be wrong again. For me to be successful as a designer, I had to figure out how to communicate with my clients what my designs did. I had to answer their questions in a way that made sense to them, not me. I had to express to them the rationale behind a design using words that would appeal to them and meet their needs.
If I could do that, I thought, I would be successful.
UX Is Still Young
A lot of people working in UX today didn't come from a school that specializes in the field nor did we take a class to teach us a user-centered approach. We migrated into UX from other areas within the company: marketing, IT, graphic design, research. Even human behaviorists and psychologists have found their relevance in UX.
Whatever your path, a lot of us UXers have similar stories. Most of us didn't start out in UX, because UX didn't exist. So we have a design industry full of people with backgrounds that are vastly different than their current job titles.
In addition, for many companies, design has always been just a utility. We used to only hire designers to make our stuff look more professional, to be sure the brand was consistent, or to communicate a creative idea. Now, we hire designers because there are difficult problems that must be solved in order for our products to be successful in the marketplace. Great design is the expected norm. Now, designers are at the center of the product development cycle in a way that previously
| Preface xiii

was thought to be unnecessary. Executives, too, now realize just how important design is, and they want to influence the process because their business is on the line. More people in the organization than ever before see the value in designing a great user experience.
What happens when you take an industry full of creative, right-brained thinkers and thrust them into the middle of a product cycle with usability problems and business goals? Well, it's no surprise that there is a disconnect between what a business stakeholder wants and what the designer has so carefully crafted. And so the two meet in the middle, in a meeting.
That's where we find ourselves today: in a meeting with people who don't know how to do our job, yet consistently tell us how they think we should do it. It's enough to drive any designer insane.
This book sits at the intersection of the UX design industry and the digital product business, where previous expectations that design is just about making pretty pictures conflicts with strong ideas about how to solve problems for the business. The growth and maturity of the UX industry has changed our role in so many ways, none more so than the need to explain ourselves to other people who don't share our experience in design.
What This Book Is About
The purpose of this book is to help designers become better communicators--to expertly explain their design decisions to the people who have influence over their project. The entire premise of the book centers around a meeting: a meeting with clients or stakeholders at which we present and talk about our design decisions. Everything is written with this meeting in mind: before, during, and even after this meeting. Everything that we will walk through focuses on this meeting and is meant to help you become better at leading, participating in, and getting support in these situations.
Some of these meetings will involve a lot of other people, but the majority of them involve just a few. Some might take place in a conference room, whereas others are impromptu hallway talks or online conversations. Don't obsess over those details; instead, focus on the overarching principles that you can apply in any situation. The goal is to remain flexible and able to adapt quickly to different situations.

It might seem as if you'd need weeks to prepare to talk to someone about your work! But, in reality, it all happens very quickly. Sometimes you'll have plenty of time to prepare. Other times, you'll need to form a response off-thecuff and make very quick judgment calls. That's the reason learning these skills and committing them to habit is so important. You want articulating design decisions to be something you can do so effortlessly that you no longer need to spend conscious effort applying all the advice contained in this book.
Let me be very clear: this is not about an "us versus them" mentality suggesting that designers are always right and opposing stakeholders who would otherwise make bad decisions. Rather, articulating design decisions is about creating an environment in which stakeholders can clearly see the expertise and thought process of the designers so that they want to support them. It's about creating trust, demonstrating effectiveness, and doing so in a way that's compelling and convincing.
In fact, one of the assumptions I make going into this book is that your design is the right thing to do. I have to assume that: you've done your research, you've made good decisions, you're solving a problem for the business, and the design you propose is the right choice. If that's not true, then no amount of wordsmithing your way around stakeholders is going to make any difference at all.
Talking to people about design might seem like a basic skill, but it's actually really difficult to do. In my experience, designers have a difficult time adequately communicating with nondesigners in a way that's effective. So, keep reading and learn how to better communicate to stakeholders, keep your sanity, and deliver the best user experience.
Who Should Read This Book
This book is written primarily for designers working with other nondesigner stakeholders: graphic, web, UX, interaction, interface, or visual designers.
DESIGNERS If you've ever had the experience of a stakeholder insisting on a change that you disagreed with, this book is for you. It's a common situation for designers to feel as if their own expertise and judgment is overruled
| Preface xv

by stakeholders who know little about design. This book is meant to bridge that gap and help you convince them your decisions are the best choice.
SENIOR DESIGNERS You might think you've been doing this long enough and you're already sufficiently skilled at articulating design decisions. That may be true, but how often are you applying thoughtful, deliberate effort at presenting your work? Besides validating what you already know, I provide a lot of actionable tactics to make it easier to put into practice.
Articulating design decisions is not something you can learn, become an expert in, and never have to work on again. It requires regular conscious effort and practice. You may be a black belt, but every time you enter the ring you can lose if you're not practiced, ready, and aware.
THE WHOLE PRODUCT TEAM Despite the fact that this book is written for designers, because it is nontechnical and deals with many common problems, many other roles in the organization will be able to relate to, and benefit from, these tips and best practices. I've spoken with many researchers, developers, content strategists, and product owners who all benefited from the concepts and ideas in this book.
How This Book Is Organized
Chapter 1 starts by demonstrating how and why communication is a critical part of the design process in today's organizations. Our designs do not speak for themselves, so we must understand how clear communication is the missing component in many design processes.
Chapters 2 through 10 are organized in a linear fashion, centered around the meeting with stakeholders. We walk through the process of meeting about and presenting design. At each step, you'll see a timeline (such as the one that follows) to indicate where we are in the meeting. Along the way, we'll cover things such as understanding stakeholder perspectives, empathizing with them, and doing the prep work necessary to meet with them. During the meeting itself, we look at both implicit and explicit listening skills as well as learning to get in the right frame of mind before responding. Next, I propose several simple tactics and formulas to help you get support for your designs by
| xvi  Preface

forming the best response. Yet, even after the meeting has concluded, it's still necessary to follow up and make adjustments to your work to ensure that you maintain the best user experience. From beginning to end, these chapters cover everything you need to know about meeting with stakeholders to talk about your design decisions.
However, because working with people isn't always a precise linear process, I offer some tips and best practices that will be relevant in many other areas of your work. For example, taking good notes is discussed at length in both Chapter 3 and Chapter 9, but the application for documenting design decisions is relevant in every step of your design process.
Finally, I close the book with Chapter 11, "How Executives Can Help Designers." This chapter is written for nondesigner executive stakeholders and is intended to be a resource for anyone involved in making design decisions. Managers, executives, and business leaders will benefit from learning to work with designers more effectively. Designers are encouraged to share this chapter with their executive stakeholders.
Why I Wrote This Book
I wrote this book because I want to help designers and companies create better experiences, but there is a large gap in communication between designers and stakeholders. To fill that gap, I provide real, practical advice that you can apply to your work right now. I did it, in part, to document and clarify my own thinking on how design is influenced by communication, but I also did it to help me be intentional about the things I do every day. This book is my own personal checklist for how to talk about design, and I am also excited to share it with you. I hope it will be a useful tool for you as well.
I've met so many great people because of this book. The relationships, connections, conversations, tips, and advice have been invaluable. It has been a fantastic experience, and I've loved facilitating this conversation about an important area of our industry. Not only that, but it has given me the opportunity to travel all over the world to speak at conferences and work with teams who I would have never had the pleasure
| Preface xvii

of knowing otherwise. I get messages from people who tell me that this book has changed their career for the better or helped them get a promotion. People will share stories with me about how they applied a tactic and whether it worked or not. I've had the pleasure of leading dozens of teams through workshops where we practice, discuss, and hone these skills in person.
I'd love to hear from you too. Feel free to reach out, follow me on Twitter, add me on LinkedIn, or share a story about how you've dealt with this problem. Mostly, I hope the book will help you too.

Acknowledgments
Someone asked me once what I do to relax. Reading? Movies? Exercise? While I do enjoy those things, after thinking about it for a few minutes I said that the best way for me to relax and unwind is to spend time with and talk to my wife, Hannah. This book would not be possible without her support, understanding, and encouragement. Hannah is my favorite human, candid collaborator, and devoted partner. She's much smarter than me and has contributed more to this book than she'd take credit for. I could not have written this book (twice!) without her sacrifices. I love you, schmoopie. I also owe a huge thanks to the reviewers: Dennis Kardys, Christy EnnisKloote, Anthony Armendariz, Heather Wydeven, C. Todd Lombardo, Brad Nunnally, Cynthia Savard Saucier, Dan Klyn, Kate Rutter, and Cindy Alvarez. This book is much more accurate and significantly less offensive because of their help. Last (but certainly not least) I have to thank all of my existing and previous clients, bosses, managers, and executives. Without you, this book would not be possible. In fact, every person who has ever worked with me is in some way a part of this book. I became good at talking about design because of you. I had to! You gave me no choice! I learned these skills through years of working with you, and now it's time for me to share it with the world.

Great Designers Are Great Communicators
Have you ever had to make changes to your design work you disagreed with? Me too! It's not easy to talk about design, especially with people who aren't designers. The ability to effectively articulate design decisions is critical to the success of a project, because the most articulate person usually wins. In fact, I would say that the difference between a good designer and a great designer is in their ability to not only solve problems with design, but to also articulate how their solution solves it in a way that's compelling, fosters agreement, and gets the support needed to move forward. That's what this book is about: getting support for your design decisions. Lots of people are involved in the design process. What was once relegated to a visual aesthetic is now the center of everyone's attention. People from all over the organization see the value of creating a great user experience, and they all want to participate. Marketing, executives, developers, product management, even people in accounting will want to tell you how they think it should work. People are excited about user experience (UX) because they recognize the long-term effect it has on the product, the business, and the bottom line. The good news? You're a very popular person!

The Big Meeting
One Sunday in January, I had to catch a late flight to San Francisco for a client meeting the next morning. But this wasn't just any meeting. About a dozen people from different areas of the company were all presenting designs to the CEO of a large retail website. Vice presidents, directors, product owners, and UX designers were all involved in putting together a three-hour event that would lay the groundwork for an entire season's worth of projects, as long as they could get this one executive's support.
After working with several product managers and attending several meetings, I understood the body of work I was presenting and began preparing my slides. The Friday before, I sat in on a four-hour conference call, during which everyone on the team practiced their presentation to a VP, who provided feedback and suggestions for how to best present their ideas to the CEO.
It all centered around one thing: presenting design ideas to a CEO for the purpose of getting his support and buy-in. There were more meetings about the meeting, discussions about what he might say, late nights getting everything just right, and rearranging schedules to make it happen. I personally would spend 16 hours traveling, 2 nights in a hotel, and a full day in a conference room just for this one meeting. Fortunately, the meeting went well. The CEO was very receptive, provided great feedback, and everyone set to implementing the work they had designed.
But that's not the important part of this story.
What struck me about this whole thing was the amount of effort that was going into just communicating design ideas to one person. The amount of time the other designers spent actually creating the mockups was trivial compared to the time and energy that went into finding the best way of communicating them. Communicating about the designs was more important than the designs themselves.
You may not be on a large team like this or you may not be working with a large company for which a meeting with the CEO is such a big deal, but the principle is still the same. The way we talk about design to our stakeholders is critical to the success of our projects.
|2  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

Design Is Subjective...Sort Of
When I interview designers for a role on my team, I always ask them, "What makes a good design good?" The way people answer this question tells me a lot about how they think about design and, in particular, UX. Most of the answers are predictable, but they often tend to sound something like this: "a good use of space," "simplicity," or one of my favorites, "when you can't remove anything else." Now, there's nothing wrong with those answers. They express how a lot of people approach design, but they aren't truly what make a design good in the eyes of a business. It's not the approach I want for designers on my team because they speak to subjectivity--to an aesthetic that not everyone will agree on. I'm not exactly sure where these designers come up with definitions that sound like something straight out of a Jonathan Ive memoir. I don't think they learned it in art school. What concerns me is that I think they picked these catchphrases up from a social-media design phenomenon where "UX" means "something that looks as cool as an iPhone." They've adopted it from a popularity-contest mentality that believes pretty things are the same as usability. It's the same culture that causes well-intentioned designers to create a "redesign" mockup of any popular website or app without any clue as to what that business's needs are. It's less about solving problems and more about likes. The truth is, all design is subjective. What one person likes, another person hates. What seems obvious to me might not be obvious to you. What works in one context could fail miserably in another. This is why design is such a difficult thing to talk about, especially with people who aren't designers. There is little common understanding of what design is or should be.
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 3

Too Many Cooks
It would be easy to create designs if it weren't for the fact that other people on the project might disagree with our decisions. Actually, they will! There are a lot of people who may know little or nothing about design, yet who have the authority to oversee and dictate our design practice. They have a vested interest in participating in the conversation, but they aren't trained designers, and they don't have the same depth of knowledge in design or technology that we do. What's more, these people will often gladly admit that they aren't the experts. They know that they don't know, yet they still insist their ideas and opinions are right. This is one of the most bizarre parts of our relationship with stakeholders! People will readily admit they are not good at our jobs, yet insist on making changes that we believe will be detrimental to the user experience. They say that they trust us as experts and yet frequently overrule us. It can be incredibly demeaning and confusing, but the problem may not lie entirely with them. These stakeholders have to be part of our process, but we struggle with including them in a way that's helpful and doesn't derail our objectives. This is what we need to figure out.
Everyone Is a Designer!
Everyone knows good design when they see it, even if they don't know how to create it. That sounds frustrating (even ridiculous), but it's actually true. The same can be said for other arts, such as music. I may not know how to play an instrument, but I can decide what music I like (and don't like). Although there may be different preferences, we're all able to choose music we want to listen to, regardless of whether we know how to reproduce those sounds ourselves.

The Interface Is Your Interface
Because design work is so often visual, people care about the part that they see, feel, or interact with. They care about the interface. However, when your job is to create the user interface, everyone is going to care about everything that you do! All of your work is exposed, so it naturally conjures more opinions and ideas than many other areas in the organization. Our work is critical to the success of our company's products, so we must take responsibility for showing people how and why our work is so valuable. That part doesn't come automatically. It takes work, it takes practice, but more importantly...it takes good communication.
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 5

There Is No U or X in Team
Collaboration seems like it should be the pinnacle of great design work: different opinions coming together to form the best possible solution. That's what everyone really wants. The image is of a handful of respectful intellectuals, passionately debating the right solutions, ultimately leading to a collaborative discussion and an ideal design that no one could have thought of on their own. Teamwork at its best! Everyone leaves satisfied, fulfilled, and respected--ready to take on the next design challenge, right? We think we want that kind of collaboration, but it becomes far more complicated when we disagree with one another. When we disagree, we tend to become defensive. When we become defensive, we fail to focus on the real issues. The meeting ends, not with collaboration, but with grumbling compromise and, often, a crippled user experience.
In situations like this, meetings can easily turn into design-by-committee. Everyone has a suggestion for how to solve a problem. We hear different opinions on every side and are unable to defend our own choices against this barrage of feedback. One suggestion evolves into an idea for something else. That idea spurs a thought about something different. Unchecked, the conversation can spiral out of control into a hodgepodge of well-intentioned tweaks that collectively spell doom for the overall goals of the project. The thing we came together to accomplish has been muddied by groupthink and mob mentality. Remember, teamwork always ends with work.
THE CEO BUTTON Because of this, we see things like the CEO button.
The CEO button is an unusual or otherwise unexpected request from an executive to add a feature that completely destroys the balance of a project and undermines the very purpose of a designer's existence.
It's funny because it's true. You might spend weeks or months building the best possible app. Your team has poured in all the best practices. You've done usability testing to prove it works. And yet, one executive can come in and blow up the whole thing. We want to avoid this.
|6  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

HOME PAGE SYNDROME Another common problem is the home page syndrome.
The home page syndrome is a condition whereby the home screen of an application or website becomes a catchall for everything, creating a garage sale of links, buttons, and banner ads that unravels the fabric of usability, causing designers to cry themselves to sleep.
You see, sometimes no matter how hard we try, the home page just becomes a huge mess. Everyone wants their business unit represented on the home page. It's as if something doesn't exist if it isn't on the home page. That new thing we're launching? Put it on the home page. And that other thing that isn't performing well? Maybe if we put it on the home page, it will get better. Sound familiar? We have to learn to deal with this phenomenon.
Communication Is the Job
The good news is that it doesn't have to be this way. It's possible to avoid the disruption and compromise that happens so frequently in organizational design through better communication with our stakeholders. I've found that the majority of issues or concerns that our stakeholders bring to our attention are often just a matter of misunderstanding or miscommunication. The way that we talk to them about our designs is the key to ensuring that we always end up with the best possible user experience. It makes sense when you think about it. All human relationships are really nothing more than a series of bound-up understandings and misunderstandings. We don't always have control over how other people understand us in the beginning. Everyone brings their past experiences into conversations we have with them on a daily basis. We do, however, have control over how we communicate with them in order to influence those future understandings. The way that we talk to people and the things we say will influence their response.
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 7

I know you were told your job was to design stuff, but really communication is the job!
GOOD COMMUNICATORS WIN Overall, being a better communicator will give you more opportunities. I'm amazed at the number of designers who apply for a job yet lack basic communication skills. People will send me a resume without explanation, forget about interviews, or fail to follow instructions. Ultimately, I'm only going to pursue candidates who can communicate well, and so the poor communicators are passed over very quickly. It's common for my leaders or clients to express that one of the reasons they hired me was because it's so hard to find people who are reliable and can communicate effectively. I've heard many stories about former designers who simply weren't good at setting expectations, following instructions, or clearly articulating their work. The need to work with other people on the project, particularly developers and managers, is quite often the thing that sets apart good designers from bad ones. It's not about whether you can create the most innovative design, but whether you can work with people in a way that gives them confidence in you and your expertise.
|8  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

Your job will be easier if you're a good communicator. Strangely enough, that may be all it takes to set yourself apart from other designers--even designers who might be more artistically talented than you. Very simply: good communicators win.
Being Articulate Means Success
It's more than just using words, though. We have to turn those words into something that will enact change or compel people to support our decisions. We have to explain why we did what we did. It's not just using words with a frequency or persistence; it's about using them in a way that is compelling and convincing. It's about being articulate.
The key to being articulate is to understand both the message you want to communicate as well as the response you want in return. If you can learn to craft your messages in such a way that they yield the desired response, you'll find that you're much more successful at getting the things that matter to you.
THE BEST IDEAS (DON'T ALWAYS) WIN It might seem like the best ideas should always win, or that great design should speak for itself, but that's not how these situations play out in real life. It's too altruistic to believe that the best ideas are the ones that will get picked. They should, perhaps, but this is reality, and humans are part of the equation. The best ideas (unfortunately) get stuffed into an amalgamation of meetings where competing needs vie for attention. The person who can convince the other that they're right is the one who gets their way. Your design might be revolutionary, but an aggressive and well-spoken salesperson is more likely to get support if they can convince your boss that they're right.
Designers lacking the ability to explain why they did what they did end up on the losing side of the argument, forced to make changes they disagree with simply because they were unable to fend them off. This is not to say that the stakeholder relationship is adversarial. No, these discussions can feel very much like good, solid teamwork. But the inability to speak up and articulate your side will often land you in the position of making changes that won't yield the best results.
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 9

Alternately, being articulate about our designs:
Imparts intelligence You're smart, you know what you're talking about, you have expertise in this area, and you can be trusted with the solution.
Demonstrates intentionality You've thought about it, pursued it, and are logical in your approach. This isn't just a random idea; there is purpose and focus.
Expresses confidence You know what you want and how to get it done. Having a solid argument shows that you're not wishy-washy and you mean what you say.
Shows respect You value everyone's opinions and time enough that you're well prepared. You're not wasting time or disregarding others.
The way to be articulate about design is to offer a message that communicates why we did what we did in order to help stakeholders understand our rationale. More than that, we can present our work in such a way that it appeals to their needs and expectations too. We build trust with stakeholders by showing our expertise through logic and reason, and by delivering it to them in a way that makes sense to them. So, we need to harness the power of communication, be articulate, and use these skills to help people see that our decisions provide the best possible solution. Being articulate will help us be successful.
Becoming a Great Designer
To hone in on the best practices for articulating design decisions, let's look at what makes a design successful, because that will form the basis for how we communicate about it. Let's boil down UX to its very core. We must understand the fundamentals of what makes a great experience so that we can reproduce that thinking and approach.
THE BIG THREE Let's return to the question: What makes a good design good? We could debate the answer, but when it comes to creating the user experience, a design is really only good when it solves a problem. Mostly, we are trying to solve problems for the business; we're trying to accomplish
| 10  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

some goal that will help the business grow. But, if we're practicing a user-centered design approach, we must also make our designs easy to use for the people who will use it.
However, one thing that we often forget is that there are other people involved who have influence over our project. It's not enough to simply create an incredible app; we also have to get the support of our team. Without their support, our project can't move forward.
The difference between a good designer and a great designer is the ability to not only solve the problem, but also to articulate how the design solves it in a way that is compelling and fosters agreement. If you can do that, you're a great designer.
So, I would say there are three things that every design needs to be successful:
1. It solves a problem.
2. It's easy for users.
3. It's supported by everyone.
These are the basics of creating a great user experience that the average person (such as your stakeholders) can understand. Projects that fail are usually lacking in one of these areas. If you can do all three of these, your project will be a success.
Let's look at each one in more detail.
SOLVE THE PROBLEM Of all the things we're trying to accomplish with our work, we have to solve problems: business goals, engagement, conversion, interaction, feedback. Whatever the problem is, our job is to find a solution and measure its success. How will we know if we've done our job? By looking at the results before and after, tracking some specific metric, and watching it improve.
Hopefully, you and your team have already established these goals, metrics, or key performance indicators (KPIs) for your project. If not, I recommend doing them yourself so that you have a measuring stick to use in all of your conversations. Projects without goals will surely languish because there is no way to convince someone else that you're right if you have nothing by which to measure its success. It just becomes a matter of opinions, and subjectivity will make it difficult to
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 11

move forward. Therefore, if your team isn't set up to establish these in the beginning, do it now for your own sanity. Find out what the most important factors are for your stakeholders--impressions, conversion, account sign-ups--and then pick one or two measurable issues that you'd like to improve and write them down. Set this as your goal and use it to your advantage when talking to other people.
Although we're certainly adept at approaching these problems to find creative solutions, we're not always in tune with our own thought process to help other people understand why we did what we did. This is where our intuition becomes so vital, and this is what makes us good designers: we know how to solve problems with design. It's often natural for us to see a solution without giving it much thought. Other times, we might wrestle with a solution through trial and error. Either way, we're making changes over time, morphing our ideas into something that will add value. The hard part, though, is figuring out what drives that intuition. What makes this "feel right" so that we can help other people see our perspective? How does this combination of small moves result in the right solution? The practice of solving problems with design must also be accompanied by an awareness that will help us explain our decisions to other people.
When you're working on a design, you need to make yourself consciously aware of every decision you're making and why. You need to be constantly asking yourself, "What problem am I trying to solve with this?" Chapter 7 will list some of the most common ways I describe my own solutions, but for now just consider that you need to be aware of all the changes you're making, all the new things you're adding, and all the rearranging that goes into finding the right interface. Those unconscious choices hold the key to explaining your designs to other people and ensuring that your expert perspective remains at the center of the final decision process.
The best way is to write them down. There is something about moving your unconscious thought to a more tangible form that allows you to remember everything you've done. Because you have measurable problems you're trying to solve, write down the problem and then list your solutions next to it. Do whatever it takes to document your own thought process.

I am a list maker, so I love to type lists and sync them across all my devices. Some people prefer to put pen to paper and allow their hand to make the physical movements necessary to connect their thoughts to the real world. You can do this with simple notes or more complex sketches. Make a list on paper of your solutions or even draw a storyboard that demonstrates the before and after effects of your designs. The method you use for writing down your answers doesn't matter. The point is to get you thinking about your decisions in concrete ways.
Here are a few examples from my own work:

PROBLEM
Users don't realize the filter controls have updated the list of results because it's instantaneous.

PROPOSED SOLUTION
· Move the count of items in the list closer to the filters so that the user can see the number change.
· Briefly show a loading spinner on each checkbox as the user selects it.
· Add a Done button that closes the panel to give the user a sense of completing the task.

Users do not proceed to the next steps from the marketing landing page.

· Move the headline and hero image to the left to make space for the call to action (CTA) on the right.
· Change the color of the call to action to red; update the copy.
· Remove background image, too distracting.
· Position the "Next steps" list so that it will usually overlap on the fold, causing the user to want to scroll to the second CTA.

Users are not adding to their carts from the "search results" list view.

Reduce the number of actions required to add an item to the cart from search. One-tap add:
· Tapping "Add to cart" will auto-add the item to the cart first without requiring a quantity or other information

· On tap, the button changes to a quantity with an initial value of 1. User can increment quantity as needed.

· Remove secondary "Add to cart" confirmation button.

· New messaging animates to indicate that the item was added.

· "Ready to Checkout?" call to action slides in underneath messaging.

· Items with options, such as color or size, will automatically select a default but provide the user with the option to change it within view.

| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 13

It can also be useful to describe your designs using only words. So much of our work is purely visual that it can be difficult to understand what that "sounds like" in a world without pictures. Because our end goal is to tell other people about it, why not attempt to describe every detail in sentence form and assume that the reader doesn't have the ability to see it? How would you describe your designs to someone on the phone? Or by email? Writing down how you see your work will reveal many of your motivations, some of which you never realized were there. The purpose of this exercise is to help you uncover your thought process and articulate your decisions first to yourself. It's not intended to be a substitute for demonstrating your designs visually.
Here's an example from one of my projects:
The list view is sorted alphabetically by country by default. The standard sort menu is available in the top right. I made each item in the list exactly the right height for a mobile touch target. On the far left of each item is that country's flag. We thought that would make them more easily identifiable to people. Next to the flag is the name of the country in bold and then a short description of the project directly underneath, in smaller gray type. A quick reference to the report title. On the far right of these controls are two things: (1) a summary of the data for the report type the users has selected. For example, it will show the percentage, like 34 percent for infection rate or the total in short form like 1.5 m. (2) A disclosure arrow to indicate that there is more content "to the right" if the user taps this item. The flag will make it quick for the user to find the right country and the short snippet of data will help him know if he needs to tap for a more detailed report. With this design, users should be able to quickly browse the list to find the correct report.
It doesn't need to be long, and it shouldn't be time-consuming. This isn't busywork. Do whatever it takes to help you identify your thinking. For example, if you find yourself comparing your designs to another popular platform, it's a good sign that your decision was based on solving a problem that the other platform might have already addressed. "When you tap the button, it loads the next set of results the same way that SocialApp does." It's okay to make decisions based on another app, but it doesn't always make the best case. What it will do, however, is allow you to go through a new series of questions to get to the bottom of your thinking: Why does SocialApp do it this way? Is our context

similar enough? Does SocialApp have any data? Were they intentional about this choice? Every time you're able to describe your designs, you'll uncover a part of your thought process that can help you find the best ways to talk about it.
You do not have to share these notes with your client or stakeholder. They may never see them, and that's OK. For now, this is more about practicing being intentional than it is about communicating with others. The takeaway here is that the process of writing about what you create will help your brain to connect the dots between the problem you're working on and how your designs solve it. The better you are at making those connections, the better prepared you'll be to talk about them with others. Whatever works for you, the goal here is to find a way to turn your thought process into something real, shareable, and visible, to uncover the words that will help you to explain yourself to other people in a way that makes sense.
MAKE IT EASY Obviously, if we're taking a user-centered design approach, we have to create something that is easy for users. While we know that usability is the core challenge with design, it can be difficult to explain that to other people. I assume you already understand something about usability. The purpose is not to tell you how to make your interfaces easy to use, but to help you think through your approach to usability so you can talk to other people about it.
Just as you were solving problems and making yourself aware of your decisions, you must also do the same thing here. At every step of the process, for every decision you make, ask yourself, "How does this affect the user?" The trick to answering this question is that often we simply don't know how our decisions will affect our users. We can only make our best guess, try it out, and then draw conclusions from what we observe. Like the previous section, write it down. You need to be able to answer this question first to yourself so that you're prepared to give that answer to stakeholders.
One way that I capture how my designs affect users is to write a story that is either based on a user session I observed or loosely based on the overall use case. Here are some examples:
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 15

DESIGN CHANGES

HOW IT AFFECTS THE USER
Having two similar buttons for Login and Sign Up next to each other is confusing to some users. We've observed users hesitate when deciding which button they should choose because the buttons are so similar. Because Sign Up is the most common case in this context, I've made that button the full width of the container and changed the Login button to a text link. This should make it easier for new users to sign up while still facilitating easy login for existing users. Most existing users will go directly to their account page by being automatically logged in. This should reduce confusion and increase conversion.
When researchers are in the field, they need quick access to their data without having to navigate through the app. So, rather than keep the hero image at the top of the home screen, we're moving it down in favor of a "Recent Projects" list at the top. Users can still see this important information, but their reports are more easily available to them because that's their primary use of the app after they've already accessed the projects.

Simplified, usability is about two things: common sense and research. When you're first beginning a project, you may not have much to work with as far as data or user observation. You really have no choice but to make your best guess about what will work for the user. As a usability expert, you have experience designing interfaces, so you're able to make informed assumptions based on what you believe will create the simplest experience. This is where common sense comes to play. There really is no reason to overthink it. Create the easiest solution you can think of. Do what makes sense and move on.
Of course, what you think makes sense and what a user does are quite often two different things. That's why we have research. After we've made some informed guesses, we need to test our ideas by using real people. Research can take many forms, but the most common tools
| 16  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

are either analytics or a usability study. We will talk more about this in Chapter 6, but let me say here that the challenge with analytics is that it can only tell us what the users did. It cannot tell us why they did it. The only way to actually know how your decisions affect users is to observe them. So make your best guess with the data you have, but then verify your designs with real people and make notes. You may be surprised by the results, and you'll be in a much better position to defend your decisions.
GET SUPPORT It's not enough to solve problems and make our app easy to use, because if a stakeholder won't support us, we aren't going to get anywhere at all. You could have the most innovative design in the world, but if no one on your team understands what you're trying to do, you're not going to be successful at implementing it.
What happens if you don't get support? You'll constantly rehash the same conversations over and over again. When people don't remember why you did what you did (because your explanation wasn't compelling or memorable), they'll bring it up again at the next meeting. "Now, why did we agree to do this again?" When people aren't convinced that you're right, they'll continue to think of alternatives to suggest. The project scope will increase over time as people propose adding more things: a simple control, one more button, a new menu. As a result, you won't be able to move as fast as you need to because you'll be bogged down managing requests. In the end, you might have to ship a product with a compromised user experience, all because you couldn't get stakeholders on board with your solution.
Getting the support of everyone on your team is the primary focus of this book. We aren't going to be able to get anywhere unless we're able to get everyone on the same page and agree to move in the right direction. That's what getting support is all about: convincing people to trust us with the solution. You need to create an environment where everyone understands what you're doing, believes in your expertise, and supports your choices, so that you can move on to the next thing.
I'm intentional about using the word support, rather than, say, approval or agreement. We will not get everyone to agree on a specific solution. Approval isn't the point either because it implies a certain amount of consensus. That's okay because that's not what we're looking for. We're
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 17

looking for their support--of us, our expertise, our solution, or our plan for moving forward. It's possible to get stakeholder support even if they disagree with our solution. In that way, what we're looking for is agreement to move forward, not agreement on the solution. Forward momentum is the goal, not consensus. We simply need their support.
To gain the support we need, we have to understand our designs by asking ourselves, "Why is this better than the alternative?" Implicit in this question is that we know what the alternatives are, we've considered them or even tried them, and we're prepared to explain why our solution is better.
Everything we design has another way of doing it. For each design we create, there is an alternate, often opposing, way of solving the same problem. This is the reason why we have disagreements about the solutions to begin with and a key problem with articulating design decisions. Designers can be really good at coming up with a solution for the problem, but we're less adept at understanding all of the solutions to the problem. We become so myopic when we think we've found it.
Eureka! Our solution seems so obvious that there is very little need to waste time considering any other approach. (After all, we're on a tight sprint and need to get something to the client by the end of the day.) Yet, this thinking almost always creates a conversation that we're not prepared to deal with: when the client suggests an alternate idea that we haven't considered.
Ironically, we are usually cognitively aware of some of the other alternatives. We probably tried them, moved stuff around, and eventually landed on the solution we believe is best. But it's all those little movements that we failed to make ourselves consciously aware of, and so we're less prepared to help other people understand our thought process. Likewise, we often know what our clients are going to suggest. If you've worked with your stakeholders before, you can make a pretty good guess about how they'll react (this is addressed at length in Chapter 3). Yet if you can guess how they'll react but you fail to consider those alternatives and understand why your solution is better, you will have a difficult time winning them over.
The point is this: be consciously aware of why your design decisions are better than the alternatives. Just like the previous two questions, write down your answers. Make a list of the other ways that you could
| 18  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

solve this problem. Create a bunch of alternative designs, don't throw them away, and have them available if you need them. With those alternatives, make a short list of why you think they don't solve the problem as well as your proposed design. Thinking critically about these other options will help you to be prepared to discuss your decisions with other people. Sometimes, I create very simple wireframes of the alternatives in addition to my recommendation. When the client begins asking questions about my proposed solution, I can quickly show these to visually demonstrate the differences.
MAKE IT HAPPEN If we're going to be successful at communicating with people about our designs, we must be able to answer these three questions about our work:
1. What problem does it solve? 2. How does it affect the user? 3. Why is it better than the alternative? The purpose of answering these questions is more of an exercise in getting you to understand your choices than it is a prescriptive method for documenting them. Don't worry too much about the details of how you write them down. If you can answer these three questions, you'll be well on your way to defending your decisions with the people who have influence over your project. These answers will form the basis of your response to every stakeholder concern about your designs.
| 1. Great Designers Are Great Communicators 19

Your ability to be thoughtful about a problem and articulate any solution is more important than your ability to design the perfect solution every time. When other people realize that you've put thought into it and are being intentional, they're more willing to trust you, even if they disagree. That's how you become a great designer: by describing and expressing your designs to other people in a way that makes sense to them. In that sense, being a great designer is just as much about communication skills as it is about design chops. You need to understand your decisions and then articulate them to someone else who doesn't know design as well as you do. Using these questions as our guide, you can find better ways to explain your design decisions for the purpose of convincing people you're right and ensuring the best experience for users. Even though it's easy to see exactly how being more articulate will help us succeed, in practice, it's far more difficult and complicated than that. Being articulate is more than just learning to say the right things, because nothing we say will have any effect if we don't first consider our audience. Recognizing the importance of communication in design makes it natural for us to take the next step on this path toward being a great designer: to begin seeing things from the perspective of our stakeholders.

Stakeholders Are People Too
Before we get into the details of listening to and talking to our stakeholders, I want to take a moment to look at the relationship. The single most important thing you can do to improve communication between you and your stakeholders is to improve those relationships, earn trust, and establish a rapport that will speak more for you than the words that come out of your mouth in a meeting. So much of life and work is built around relationships. It's not just who you know; it's the quality of those relationships, too. We need to see the world through the eyes of the people who have influence over our project. We have to get in their heads, find out what makes them tick, and use this information to help us approach them in a way that's productive and valuable for everyone. What's ironic to me is that UXers are so good at putting the user first, at garnering empathy for and attempting to see the interface from the perspective of the user. Yet, we often fail to do the same thing for the people who hold the keys to our success. Let's apply these same principles to the people we work with so that we can create a better product together. We need to take the time to understand our stakeholders. More than that, we need to engage with them on a personal level and improve the quality of our interactions. The purpose of this chapter is to take a step back from the process, before we get bogged down in a cycle of meetings. We begin here, with a high-level view of our stakeholder relationships so that we can approach them in the most effective way.
21

In order to do that, we need to:
See them as human Everyone has other things going on that we simply cannot predict.
Create shared experiences Finding common ground is important to earning trust.
Develop empathy Get to know their viewpoint so intimately that we're driven to action.
Ask good questions Understand how their interests outside of the office affect their perspective.
In addition to getting to know our stakeholders, it's important to look at the individuals on our team and work to improve the quality of our communication by:
Identifying influencers Based on what we already know about their role on the team, we can understand the values that drive their reactions to our work.
Building good relationships Simple things can go a long way in establishing rapport: be yourself, do stuff, and give stuff. Communication is easier in good relationships.
See Their Perspective
In order to approach people and respond to them, we must first see their perspective. We have the opportunity to learn to speak their language, to get to know them better, and to keep our project on track. Ultimately, our job is to learn how to make our stakeholders successful, because if we can help them be successful, that will help us be successful as a byproduct. It's not easy, but we can get a better sense of where people are coming from when we remember they're human, find common ground through shared experiences, develop empathy for their viewpoint, and ask questions that give us insight into their world.
SEE THEM AS HUMAN The trouble with people is that we're all so unpredictable and yet so incredibly predictable at the same time. Often the people in your meetings are dealing with things, in both their personal and professional
| 22  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

lives, which are more important to them than your current design project. People are busy (or at least they think they are). "I have too many things going on right now," or "I have to get to another meeting." Whatever the case, a lot of people you need help from are not always focused on the thing you want them to be. More than that, their attitudes and responses to your work might have more to do with the things happening outside of your conversation than what you're showing them.
Before we go any further, stop for just a minute and think about the people on your project. Call to mind their faces, names, and even their role in the company. Now, pause and remember this: they are human. Each one of them is a unique individual. Each person has feelings, emotions, and a past that speaks into their present every single day. They all have relationships outside of work that include friends, spouses, parents, and children. When they're finished with your meeting, they're going to go visit their mother in the hospital. One of them has to shuttle their kids to an athletic game. And someone else will go home to have a difficult conversation with their spouse. Despite the fact that we spend so much time together during working hours, all of these people's most important relationships are somewhere else.
We can't pretend to ever really know what's going on inside their heads, but we can take the time to realize that the way they respond to our ideas and work might have (or probably has) nothing to do with us at all. There are just too many other factors, distractions, and problems in the average person's life for us to ever assume that the thing we want from them is the thing they care about. In psychology, the concept of attribution describes how people see one another, and specifically, how we understand other people's behavior. Interestingly, most people tend to see other people's behavior as a reflection of their particular personality traits, whereas we see our own behavior as being primarily situational. You see, we may have an unfair view of our stakeholders' reactions. It's natural for us to believe that their personality ("They're not a designer") is what causes them to disagree with our solutions, but that's not true.
Was your colleague short with you in the hallway about the new interactions you made? Maybe she's dealing with some issues in her personal life. Did that guy in your last meeting throw you under the bus and blame you for a problem that he was actually responsible for? Perhaps
| 2. Stakeholders Are People Too 23

he's feeling pressure from his boss. Has an executive ever shown up and declared that everything had to be changed? It's possible he just came from a meeting and his budget was slashed. Stakeholder reactions to our design work often have an underlying situational explanation that we might never know about. I always prefer to believe the best about people, rather than assume the worst about their intentions.
I will never forget the time when a manager came to our team late in the day with an emergency request. Suddenly, everything we were working on had to be stopped so that we could put together some concepts for a completely new, different idea. The only explanation was that it had suddenly become a high priority. I tried to understand the situation, but it just didn't make sense nor did it line up with what we had agreed on previously. We did our best to appease him, but then a few days later he dropped the project and told us to go back to our original work. Later, I found out that he had lost one of his biggest contracts and was on the verge of missing his financial goals near bonus time. This new project was a last-ditch effort to make something happen, but he would never have told us that.
Of course, it wasn't appropriate for him to treat our team that way, but that's not the point. The point is that there was something else going on that we didn't understand at the time. And actually, there are always other things going on in the room that you will never know about. There are always things that are influencing people's behaviors that we are not privy to. And there will always be things that we simply can't predict. Always. The more often you remember that, the better off you'll be.
Our job as articulate designers is to recognize just enough of that reality so that we can talk to the people that we work with in a way that pushes past all the extra distractions and gets down to the core thing we need to know to be successful. We need to recognize that the way people react to our work may not have anything to do with us or our designs at all. So, as often as you need to, stop, take a look at the people around you, and remember one thing: they are human.
CREATE SHARED EXPERIENCES Our inability to see the perspective of another person often results from a lack of shared experiences. We simply don't have enough in common with them. Why do some people seem to get along better than
| 24  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

others? Why are we immediately drawn to some people, but not others? It's because we have something in common with them. When we have shared experiences, we have something to talk about. When we don't have anything in common with another person, it's nearly impossible to talk to them. Everything we think of falls flat. However, everyone has something in common with another person; this is why the weather is such an easy thing to talk about. And although the weather is a perfectly fine experience to share, if we want to understand our stakeholders, we need to be willing to go deeper than that.
That's not to say that we should dig into people's personal lives. Actually, there are plenty of ways in which we can create shared experiences with other people on a professional level. It can be something as simple as going to lunch together or grabbing a drink after work. It doesn't matter what you talk about: work, life, or the show you watched last night. The point is that you're removing yourself, your ego, and the pressure of the minute-to-minute business of work. You're out of the office--out of your usual context and experiencing something with this other person that you would not have otherwise.
Many companies organize team building and informal gatherings of employees for this very reason. But, if that's not built into your culture, you can make it happen on your own. Other ways of creating shared experiences include going to a conference, volunteering at your company's annual charity, or asking that person's advice. "Hey, I was thinking of buying a telescope and I know you're into astronomy. What would you recommend?" Finding ways to create connections with other people is an important step toward understanding them.
A Road Trip with Josh I will never forget how drastically my relationship with and approach toward a colleague changed after I had a shared experience with him. Josh was in a similar role to mine, but in a different department. As a result, we used a lot of the same shared resources, and our paths would cross on projects occasionally. My impression of him was that he was difficult to get along with: he was unorganized, inconsiderate, and I didn't respect him. It was especially challenging to work on a project with him because I knew he would have lots of different ideas, and those ideas always seemed as if they were just creating extra work for me. But by chance, one year we both ended up working at the same conference. We drove together, about three hours one way. We stayed
| 2. Stakeholders Are People Too 25

at the same resort, which happened to be a paradise of relaxation. And we spent every day out of our usual context setting things up, talking to people, and eating most of our meals together. Very quickly, I got to know him through our shared experiences.
Almost immediately, my opinion of Josh changed. From then on, his suggestions were innovative! He was no longer inconsiderate, but just a little busy and less mindful of the details. Nothing had changed, except my own perspective of him and our shared experiences. It became much easier to work with Josh and get his buy-in on projects simply because we had those shared experiences. In fact, he became one of my greatest allies.
You don't need to go on a road trip with stakeholders to create shared experiences. Finding that common ground can be as simple as bringing up something interesting before the meeting starts. You might notice that they have the latest tech gadget, are wearing a brand you like, or have a souvenir from Paris on their desk. Anything you can do to identify common ground between you will go a long way toward reminding everyone (yourself included) that you have common interests. We are more than just pixel pushers. We are people. Often, the only thing keeping us from developing good relationships is ourselves.
DEVELOP EMPATHY People in UX talk a lot about developing empathy for users. If we can have true empathy for them, we'll build better applications. But what about our stakeholders? We need to empathize with them, too, if we really expect to get through to them.
Developing empathy for our stakeholders means attempting to look at our project from their perspective so that we're no longer defensive and protective of our own ideas. We realize their reactions and suggestions are based on a reality that, for them, is more important than our own. When you have empathy for stakeholders, you not only understand their perspective but you're actually driven to action; you want to make changes to your designs because you feel their pain.
This is the point at which the script flips for you. When you have true empathy for your stakeholders, you'll see your role as being one of helping them succeed. Your success depends on their success. You'll find ways to solve problems for them, whether that's accommodating their
| 26  ARTICULATING DESIGN DECISIONS

perspective in your design work or simply presenting your work in a way that appeals to their needs. You'll see the urgency of meeting their needs and want to do something about it. That doesn't mean that you do anything and everything they say. It simply means that your priority for communicating with them has shifted from a position of defense to one of solidarity. You still might disagree on the solution, but at least now you're better prepared to talk to them about your choices. Having empathy for our stakeholders is important to establishing a foundational mindset that will allow us to form the best possible response to their feedback, as we will see in Chapter 5 and beyond. We cannot expect to listen to and respond to their feedback without first empathizing with them.
The stakeholder brain demystified! Our stakeholders have valuable domain knowledge and information about the business that we need to be successful.
Leading with Vision I once worked with an executive who was a visionary thinker, but we were building a simple minimum viable product (MVP) for the first release. At the first couple of meetings, he was underwhelmed by our basic functionality. He knew the constraints of the project, but we needed him to be on board to get his support. He was always present, but never very excited. In the process of working with him, I tried to see our project from his perspective. As an executive, he always had a high-level, 30,000-foot view of everything going on, yet we were showing him a minute detail that might only be a small blip on the radar of
| 2. Stakeholders Are People Too 27

this product. He was looking toward the endgame, a massive release with fanfare, but we were focused on this intermediary step, the here and now.
So, from that point on, I chose to bring two different mockups to each meeting. One was this baseline MVP, which was modest and simple. The other was an innovative, no-limits picture of awesome that we would never be able to pull off, at least in the short term. But I was able to hold his attention by keeping both concepts in front of him. I was able to lead our conversations with this incredible vision of a preferred future, while also showing and getting support for the thing that would allow us to take a step in that direction. He could see where we were going and so he was more likely to support our MVP.
I could not have been prepared with this approach if I wasn't able to empathize with his position. It took more work on my part, but it was worth it in the long run because it meant keeping our designs moving. He trusted us more because he could see the vision. Actually, I've found that it's often a best practice when working with executives to show both what's possible in the short term and what's preferred for the future. This approach creates a buzz that keeps everyone excited and makes it more likely that they'll support you.
ASK GOOD QUESTIONS Seeing the perspective of our stakeholders requires a lot of patience and work. It's not something that comes automatically; it takes time and practice. You should learn to view things from the perspective of your stakeholders in the same way that you would with users of your application--by asking questions. If we want to see our stakeholders as human, to create shared experiences, and to develop empathy for their situation, the best thing we can do is to just ask.
My brother-in-law, Lars, is one of the most interesting people I know. Everywhere he goes, people like to talk to him. What's funny is that he doesn't seem like a very outgoing person. His personality is a little reserved, he's careful when he speaks, and he never talks too much. Yet it seems as if people are drawn to him. When people see him, they stop to talk. If they spot him across a room, they'll seek him out. Why? It's because Lars is really good at asking questions. People love to talk to Lars because Lars is good at getting them to talk. You leave a conversation with Lars feeling like you just met someone who was really smart,
