INTRODUCTION

It was a Friday evening in December 2015, and the office was buzzing. Amid the vast, monochromatic corridors of Uber's San Francisco headquarters at 1455 Market Street--two football fields' worth of gleaming LED lights, light woods, concrete, and steel--the office was still mostly occupied at 8 p.m. Some sat at their desks quietly typing emails while others debated energetically with colleagues over videoconference. Others were drawing on whiteboards, hosting impromptu jam sessions to tackle the tricky operational problems facing who- knows-what. And a few pairs of employees were walking up and down the main flow in one-o n-one meetings, some in intense discussion and others just catching up.
Everywhere you looked, there were reminders of the global scale of Uber's business as well as the international heritage of the team driving it. Colorful flags from every country hung from the ceiling. Conference room screens hosted videoconferences with colleagues from faraway offices in Jakarta, São Paulo, and Dubai--sometimes simultaneously! Flat-screen TVs were scattered throughout the floor showing metrics, broken down by mega-region, country, and city, so that teams could monitor progress. The global culture seeped into the naming conventions for conference rooms: near the entrance, the names started with Abu Dhabi and Amsterdam, and at the far other end of the floor, they ended with Vienna, Washington, and Zurich.
At first glance Uber might just look like a simple app--after all,

THE COLD START PROBLEM

the premise was always to hit a button and get a ride. But underneath its deceptively basic user interface was a complex, global operation required to sustain the business. The app sat on a vast worldwide network of smaller networks, each one representing cities and countries. Each of these networks had to be started, scaled, and defended against competitors, at all hours of the day.
It was in my role at Uber that I really came to viscerally understand networks, supply and demand, network effects, and their immense power to shape the industry. As you might imagine, the Uber experience had its ups and downs--it was a rocketship and a roller coaster, rolled into one. I've come to call it a "rocketcoaster" experience, which is an appropriate description for a company that had gone from an idea to a tiny startup to a massive global company with more than 20,000 employees in less than a decade.
The worldwide operations of the company were complex and intense, and much of the command and control radiated from the center of Uber's San Francisco headquarters. In the middle of the main floor, built from gleaming surfaces of glass and metal, stood the War Room.
To many, it was a big mystery--the War Room didn't share the normal naming convention of city names where Uber operated. It couldn't be booked for meetings as the others could, and was sometimes attended to by security guards. That's because it wasn't a normal meeting room. Many companies (inside and outside tech) have the notion of "war rooms." But, they are typically conference rooms converted temporarily to dedicated use by a product team, working intensely to tackle an emergency product. After the situation is resolved, the room is quickly converted back to normal use. For Uber, perhaps appropriate to its unique needs, this War Room was not temporary at all--it was built to operate twenty-four hours, around the clock. It was built as a huge, permanent room with dark wood walls, multiple flat-screen TVs, a large conference table that could fit a dozen people, and additional sofa seating. Red digital clocks gave the current times in Singapore, Dubai, London, New York, and San Francisco. Given the company's global

footprint, there was almost always some kind of emergency situation somewhere in the world that needed attention, and this was often the room where it was dealt with.
That December, the emergency was in San Francisco, the company's hometown.
Scheduled to start at 7 p.m. and run into the night, the urgent meeting was booked on everyone's calendar as "NACS," which stood for the North American Championship Series, an oblique reference to its agenda focusing on operations, product road map, and competitive strategy in the top markets in the United States and Canada. This meeting was a key mechanism for the CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick--called "TK" within the company--to review the entire business, city by city.
A small group of about a dozen executives and leaders attended the meeting, including myself and the heads of finance, product, and critically, the RGMs--short for "Regional General Managers." The RGMs ran the largest teams at Uber, constituting the on-the-g round Operations city teams that engaged with drivers and riders. The RGMs were thought of as the CEOs of their markets, holding responsibility for revenues and losses, the efforts of thousands of Ops folks, and were always closest to the trickiest problems in the business. I was there to represent the Driver Growth Team--a critical team responsible for recruiting the scarcest asset in the entire business, Uber drivers. It was a big effort for Uber--w e spent hundreds of millions just on driver referrals programs, and nearly a billion in paid marketing. Adding more drivers to the Uber network was one of the most important levers we had to grow the business.
The weekly NACS meeting opened with a familiar slide: a grid of cities and their key metrics--tracking the top two dozen markets. Each row represented a different city, with columns for revenue, total trips, and their week-over-w eek change. It also included operational ratios like the percentage of trips that hit "surge pricing," where riders had to pay extra because there weren't enough drivers. Too much surge, and riders would switch to competitors. Uber's largest

THE COLD START PROBLEM

markets, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, were always near the top of the list, representing billions of annual gross revenue each, with smaller cities like San Diego and Phoenix near the bottom.
TK sat closest to the screen, dressed casually in a gray T-shirt, jeans, and red sneakers. At the sight of the numbers, he sprung up from his chair and walked up close to the screen. He squinted, staring intensely at the numbers. "Okay, okay . . ." he said, pausing. "So why did surge increase in San Francisco so much? And why is it up even more in LA?" He began to pace up and down the side of the War Room, the intensity of the questions increasing. "Have we seen referral sign-u ps dip in the last week? How's the conversion rate in the funnel going? Were there big events this week? Concerts?" Folks in the room began to chime in, answering questions and raising their own.

A Network of Networks
It was my first year at the company, and although many companies have weekly reviews, Uber's were different. First, in the discussion about each city, the level of detail surprised me. For San Francisco, the group began to discuss the surge percentages in the city's seven-mile by sevenmile center, versus East Bay, versus the Peninsula. This was a senior group of executives, but the granularity and level of detail was incredible. But this was a requirement to run a complex, hyperlocal network like Uber where supply and demand depended on the dynamics of popular neighborhoods and frequent "lanes"--like Marina and the Financial District--that tended to be poorly served by other transportation options.
In the weekly dashboard, each row represented a city--yes--b ut more important, each city was an individual network in Uber's global network of networks that needed to be nurtured, protected, and grown. It was deeply and uniquely ingrained in Uber's DNA to talk about met-

rics at the hyperlocal network level. In my several years there, it was unusual to ever hear about an aggregate number--like total trips or total active riders--except as a big vanity milestone at a company all-hands. Those aggregate metrics were regarded as mostly meaningless. Instead, the discussion was always centered on the dynamics of each individual network, which could be nudged up or down independently of each other, with increased marketing budget, incentive spend for either drivers or riders, product improvements, or on-the-g round operational efforts.
The NACS meetings were used to evaluate the health of each of the networks and the global network as a whole--a central means of accounting for the twenty or so cities that represented the majority of revenue to the company. Furthermore, it was important to go even further in granularity and break the network into the two sides, both the rider side (demand) and the driver side (supply), to make sure each side was healthy but also that they were in balance with each other. Too much surge, and riders stop taking trips. Too little surge, and drivers start to go offline and head home after a long night.
The slides continued. Several of us on the NACS team, including myself, had been working on a hypothesis over the past few days. Ops teams had reported seeing large increases in driver referrals by our primary US competitor, Lyft, over the past few weeks, which was causing drivers to switch over in droves. Driver referrals were typically structured as a give/get incentive--give $250 and get $250 when your friend signs up to drive. A dramatic rise in demand during the holiday season was causing a big undersupply of drivers in the key competitive markets on the West Coast, primarily San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. For riders, this resulted in a terrible experience--if you request a ride, it would take far longer than usual, sometimes twenty minutes, which meant more riders were canceling their requests. They might even decide to check our competitor's pricing and service level, and book there instead. These cancels were frustrating for Uber's drivers, who might have already driven for a few minutes. Piss them off too

THE COLD START PROBLEM

many times, and it might cause a chain reaction as they'd have even more incentive to stop for the night, and switch off to a competitor's network.
TK grew more intense and agitated as the hypothesis was presented. "This is not good, guys. Not good." He exhaled deeply. What was the right solution? With the years of experience from operating these networks, it was likely that one solution would quickly rebalance the sides of the market. The right solution would need to start on the supply side, to grow our base of drivers quickly and lower ETAs and the cancel rate, and that meant a driver incentive. "What if . . . we did a $750/$750 referral bonus here in SF, LA, and San Diego?"
This would be a big move, a far bigger number than had ever been thrown out. But San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego needed the help. These were some of the most competitive markets that would need to be quickly rebalanced with more supply. TK looked around the room, pausing, and then answered his own question. "Yeah. That would get their attention. That'll wake them up!" he said, smiling and nodding.
Others were not so quick to jump to incentives as the solution. The past year had been good for Uber in the United States, turning it into a cash-flow positive area as the competition in the new China business simultaneously generated both incredible trips growth and severe losses. Uber was in a vicious fight with Didi--its Chinese rideshare competitor--burning on the order of a billion dollars a year primarily because of incentive spending. We started to bat around other ideas, including improving how to display ETA estimates as well as ways to discourage riders from canceling. There were other ways to rebalance the various networks without using incentives, which is a powerful tool but not the only one. The conversation went in circles, and TK grew visibly frustrated.
TK paced around the room again. "No, no! Look, guys. Our network is collapsing. We need to stop the bleeding . . . now!" He chopped his hand into the other. "Let's do the other stuff and get it on the road

map, but let's get this email out over the weekend. Who can help me put it together?" This decisiveness was informed by years of fierce in-the- trenches competition--c ompanies like Flywheel, Sidecar, Hailo, and many others that were vanquished--driven by lightning-fast responses in situations like this. The Uber team monitored and responded to the health of their local city networks with speed and precision. And with that, the next step was clear.
The RGMs agreed to own it, and I would work with my team-- which was accountable for the product/engineering side of driver referrals--to make changes to the structure and amounts. We committed to ship the changes before Monday. We took note of a number of other follow-ups due from the meeting, and we all decided to reconvene the group again next week. It was Friday and almost 10 p.m., and many of us had been working since early morning to prep for this meeting. I walked home, just a few short blocks away in the Hayes Valley neighborhood of San Francisco, and started my "Netflix and email" routine to close out the day.
This was my first experience with the North American Championship Series, and it turned into a weekly briefing, usually Friday midmorning. But sometimes it got scheduled at Tuesdays at 9 p.m., or Sundays at 2 p.m., when that was the only way to get everyone together. Although NACS was just one part of my role at Uber, it quickly became one of the most educational in how to think about starting and scaling network effects. For a multiyear span, I was lucky to be embedded in this critical team that operated Uber's biggest markets. Each week was different. At the NACS meetings, we shifted our attention nimbly each session from network rebalancing on the West Coast, to prioritizing product features to increase revenues, to launching new regions, and everything in between.
Uber was already hitting its stride when I joined but I had a front- row seat to the team that grew the business to 100 million active riders in 800+ markets worldwide, and $50 billion in gross revenue. It was an incredible experience, and I am proud of the work that we

did there. It didn't happen automatically--there were tens of thousands of people working hard to deal with network dynamics in hundreds of markets around the world, and we learned all the hard lessons from competing with fearsome local competitors who have their own strong network effects, too. I'm lucky to have been at Uber during a hypergrowth period, joining at the start of a so-called hockey stick curve--a curve that bent up as the business grew over 10x in a few years.
My time at Uber was an unforgettable experience. I got to see a startup scale to tens of thousands of employees, millions of customers, and billions in revenue. I saw new products start at zero and then rapidly scale up to dominate the market. It was a deeply educational journey, one that created many lifelong friendships--including people I still talk to every week. But by 2018, it was time for me to move on. The company had a tumultuous few years, a complete changing of the guard, and a new set of priorities that were less entrepreneurial than in the past. I wanted the opposite of that, and for my next chapter, I decided to go back to my roots: working with entrepreneurs to build the next big thing, but this time, as a venture capitalist.

Foundational Questions

In 2018, I began a new career after Uber, as a startup investor at Andreessen Horowitz. Started a decade earlier by entrepreneurs Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen, the firm made a splash when it launched, making a series of notable investments in startups including Airbnb, Coinbase, Facebook, Github, Okta, Reddit, Stripe, Pinterest, Instagram, and others. The firm built a foundation of nerdy street cred by hiring longtime Silicon Valley founders and executives who promoted a philosophy of hands-o n operating expertise. The team began to refer to the firm by its shortened numeronym "a16z," a geeky reference to software development practices that often replaced long words like internationalization into i18n. The culture at a16z fit me perfectly.
Rejoining the startup world, this time as an investor, let me tap into a network of relationships and knowledge built over a dozen years in the San Francisco Bay area. Predating Uber, I had written and published nearly a thousand essays on topics like user growth, metrics, viral marketing--along the way, popularizing tech industry jargon like "growth hacking" and "viral loops." My blog would be read by hundreds of thousands, and due to this as well as the natural serendipity of the startup ecosystem, I came to become acquainted with a broad community of entrepreneurs and builders. I would come to serve as an advisor and angel investor to dozens of startups, including Dropbox, Tinder, Front, AngelList, and many others. All of this, combined with my expertise from Uber, would be the foundation to launch my career in venture capital.
Everything was different in the new role. Rather than commuting to Uber's offices in the chaotic center of San Francisco, I headed to the firm's idyllic offices near Stanford University. The a16z offices combine culture and invention--its hallways are lined with artwork from Rausche nberg, Lichtenstein, and contemporary artists, while its conference rooms are named after great inventors and entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Grace Hopper, Ada Lovelace, and William Hewlett. The

10

THE COLD START PROBLEM

work was very different from Uber's day-to-day as well--rather than going very deep into one sector, like rideshare, instead my purview was extremely broad.
Every day I was meeting with entrepreneurs to talk about their new ideas. In a given year, the firm might see thousands of startup ideas, many of which are new kinds of social networks, collaboration tools, marketplaces, and other new products--relevant to the examples in this book. Conversations with startups begin with a "first pitch" meeting, where the entrepreneurs introduce themselves, show the product, and talk through their strategy. These are pivotal meetings, because when they go well, the startup could eventually receive an investment in the millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. It's high stakes.
Jargon thrives in these presentations: "Network effects." "Flywheel." "Viral loops." "Economies of scale." "Chicken and egg." "First mover advantage." These are some of the buzzwords and jargon that get thrown around in pitch meetings. And they are often accompanied with diagrams full of arrows and charts going up and to the right. The term "network effect" has almost become a cliché. It's a punch line to difficult questions, like "What if your competition comes after you?" Network effects. "Why will this keep growing as quickly as it has?" Network effects. "Why fund this instead of company X?" Network effects. Every startup claims to have it, and it's become a standard explanation for why successful companies break out.
But with all of these discussions and pitches, I realized I was getting confused, and I wasn't the only one. While "network effects" and its related concepts were often invoked, there was no depth to the idea. No metrics that could prove if it was really happening or not.
In my work with startups, and after a decade and a half of living in the San Francisco Bay area, I've heard "the network effect" used a zillion times in conversation. Sometimes over coffee, in meetings, or in investor discussions, but the concept was always discussed at a superficial level.
So how do you hear something thousands of times and still not quite understand it?

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 10

If network effects were a straightforward concept to understand, we would be in strong agreement on which companies have them, and which ones don't. We would know what numbers to look at to validate it was really happening. And we'd have a step-b y-step understanding of how to create and build up network effects. And yet we don't. And it bothers me to a great degree, because it has become a critical topic in today's technology landscape. This is the journey that brought me to writing this book.
I began to research and to write The Cold Start Problem because I found my own understanding of the dynamics of networks to be unforgivably shallow for something so core to the technology industry. The network effect is something I've seen firsthand at Uber, and yet I lack the vocabulary and the frameworks to articulate the deep nuances.
There's a gap between the practitioners and the rest of the business world. For practitioners who work on specific networked products, the focus is on improving the mechanics within their very particular domains. Within rideshare, the discussion revolved around riders and drivers, reducing pickup times, surge pricing, and an accumulated set of specialized vocabulary and concepts that only apply to on-demand transportation. For a workplace chat tool, it's about channels and discovery and notifications and plug-ins. They feel unrelated, even though both product categories have deep network effects and are both ways to connect people. There should be a set of universal concepts and theories to talk about network effects, regardless of their product category.
We need to be able to answer the basics: What are network effects, really? How do they apply to your business? How do you know if your product has them--and which other products don't? Why are they so hard to create, and how do you create them? Can you add a network to your product after the fact? How do they impact your business metrics, at the tactical level? Is Metcalfe's Law actually right, or should you apply something else to your strategy? Will your network fail or will it succeed? Does your competitor have network effects, and if so, what is the best way to compete with them?

THE COLD START PROBLEM

Startup advice says, all that matters is to build a great product-- after all, that's what Apple does. But why has it also been so critical to launch products in the right way? To get your product in the hands of influencers, or high school students, or aspirational technology companies--if B2B--if all that matters is the product? What's the right way to launch, and what's the sequence of ways to expand?
How do you build network effects in your product? How do you know when network effects are kicking in, and if they are strong enough to create defensibility? How do you pick the right metrics to optimize to achieve viral growth, reengagement, defensibility, and other desired effects? What product features do you build to amplify network effects?
When fraudsters, spammers, and trolls inevitably show up, what's the proper recourse? What have we seen other networks do in the past to combat the negative effects of a large, thriving network? And more generally, how do you keep scaling a network that's already working, especially in the face of saturation, competition, and other negative dynamics?
What happens when two networked products compete--what makes one player win over another? Why did we see big networks often succumb to smaller ones? How do you launch new networks across new geographies and product lines, particularly in competitive markets?
These are the most fundamental questions we can ask about network effects, and when you search for the answers--whether in books or online--there are only smatterings of actionable, pragmatic insights though there is plenty of high-level strategy. The best thoughts came from operators, at startups and bigger companies, who have been in the trenches and so that's where I started the process of writing my book.
I began by conducting more than a hundred interviews with the founders and teams that built Dropbox, Slack, Zoom, LinkedIn, Airbnb, Tinder, Twitch, Instagram, Uber, and many others. I asked them questions to learn about the earliest days, when it was just the cofounders and a handful of other people trying to take on the world. I also researched historical examples spanning hundreds of years--going back to chain

letters, credit cards, and telegraph networks, and tying their success to modern innovations in Bitcoin, livestreaming, and workplace collaboration tools. All of this exposed a rich set of qualitative and quantitative data that forms the foundation of this book.
I found that people were repeating the same ideas and concepts, and observed that they were recurring throughout multiple sectors. You could talk to someone who spent their career working on social networks, and find that they had ideas that were equally applicable to marketplaces. Similarly, my time at Uber made me understand the dynamics in a network of riders and drivers, which informs my view of products like YouTube and its two-sided network of creators and viewers. Or Zoom, with its meeting organizers and attendees. Dozens of these recurring themes echo throughout the industry, whether we're thinking about B2B or consumer products.

The Definitive Guide to Network Effects
The Cold Start Problem is the culmination of hundreds of interviews, three years of research and synthesis, and nearly two decades of experience as an investor and operator. It takes much of the knowledge and core concepts swirling inside the technology industry and frames them in the context of the beginning, middle, and end of a network's life cycle. This is the core framework I'll describe via the major sections of this book, along with examples, and providing an actionable road map for your own products.
This is a critical topic. I've come to see network effects--h ow to start them, and how to scale them--a s one of the key secrets of Silicon Valley. There are just a few dozen software products with a billion active users on the planet, and many of them share lineages of founders, executives, and investors who have unique expertise. This knowledge in turn has been developed in the tech community over decades of building social networks, developer platforms, payment networks, marketplaces,

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 13

THE COLD START PROBLEM

workplace apps, and so on. This community of elite talent collaborates and cross-p ollinates, switching from one product category into another, bringing all of this knowledge together. I have seen this firsthand, and my interviews with founders and experts in writing The Cold Start Problem further illustrated the interconnectedness of these concepts.
Based on the foundational theories of network effects, I've taken these lessons and put skin in the game, focusing my venture capital investing at a16z toward products that have networks at their core. I find myself most captivated by new startups where connecting people lay at the heart of the product, whether for communication, socializing, work, or commerce. I'm now three years into the industry, and have invested over $400 million into more than two dozen startups in marketplaces, social apps, video and audio, and more. I've found my learnings about network effects to apply widely across the industry--everything from Clubhouse, which seeks to build a new audio social app, to Substack, which lets writers publish and monetize premium newsletters for their readers. And even video games, food pickup, or edtech.
My goal is to write the definitive book on network effects--o ne that is practical enough, and specific enough, to apply to your own product. You should be able to use its core framework to figure out where your product is on the journey, and what product efforts are needed to drive it forward. I've tried to lay out the entire life cycle--from the underlying mechanics of how to create network effects, how to scale them, to the best way to harness them--a ll from a practitioner's point of view, diving deep far beyond the buzzwords and high-level case studies that have been written.
The first phase of the core framework, naturally, is called the Cold Start Problem, which every product faces at its inception, when there are no users. I'm borrowing a term here for something many of us have experienced during freezing temperatures--it's extra hard to get your car started! In the same way, there's a Cold Start Problem when a network is first launched. If there aren't enough users on a social network and no one to interact with, everyone will leave. If a workplace chat

product doesn't have all your colleagues on it, it won't be adopted at the office. A marketplace without enough buyers and sellers will have products listed for months without being sold. This is the Cold Start Problem, and if it's not overcome quickly, a new product will die.
This is all in the service of helping you, the reader, whether you are a software engineer, designer, entrepreneur, or an investor. Perhaps you partner with one of these companies I reference throughout the book, or are seeing technology reinvent your industry in the form of networks. Network effects are a powerful and critical force in the technology sector--a s the entire economy is increasingly reinvented, it will become even more important to understand.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves--first, what's a network effect, anyway?

WHAT'S A NETWORK EFFECT, A N Y WAY ?

In its classic usage, a network effect describes what happens when products get more valuable as more people use them. This is a simple definition, which I will deepen the framework of in later chapters, but it's a good starting point. For Uber, the more users joined the app, the more likely it would be for riders to quickly find someone to take them from point A to B. It also meant that it would be easier for drivers to fill their time with trips, increasing their earnings. While mobile apps like Uber can create network effects, the classic example of these forces came much earlier. In fact, it's educational to use as an example a technology product first introduced more than a hundred years ago and that we still use today on a daily basis: the telephone.
In 1908, there were fewer than 5 million phones for nearly 90 million people in the United States. Most of these phones were operated by the American Telephone & Telegraph Company. It was still a new technology, just a few decades old, but the company was thriving after being founded by Alexander Graham Bell, who invented and patented the first practical telephone. Today, of course, we would know the American Telephone & Telegraph Company under its modern name, AT&T.

THE COLD START PROBLEM

The company's president at the time was Theodore Vail, who in his annual reports wrote unusually cogent, insightful, and philosophical observations about his business. For AT&T's annual report in 1900, Vail references the core concept of the network effect--but without the contemporary name:

A telephone without a connection at the other end of the line is not even a toy or a scientific instrument. It is one of the most useless things in the world. Its value depends on the connection with the other telephone and increases with the number of connections.2

Ultimately Vail's observation on the power of the network could be equally applicable to a telephone network, or a social network, or even the chat platform you use at work. Intuitively, it makes sense--if your friends, family, coworkers, or celebrities you know aren't using the same apps that you are, then the network is much less useful--o r maybe completely useless. Whether it's a photo-sharing app where you'd want to see their photos, or a file-s haring service you use to access your coworkers' latest documents, you want the right people on the network with you. It's a simple idea, with profound implications for everything from product design to marketing to business strategy.
A subtler, but critical, point in Vail's statement is that there is a fundamental duality at play--first a physical product, the telephone--a nd then a second, the network of people and physical wiring that serve to interconnect the phones. I often refer to these two interchangeably, or together, in the form of "networked product"--b ut the distinction is important. A successful network effect requires both a product and its network, and that was true in the age of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company, and true today. For Uber, the "product" is the app that people run on their phones, and the "network" refers to all the active users at any given time who are connecting with Uber to drive or ride. (There's no physical wiring, in this case!) In contemporary par-

21

lance, the product is typically made of software whereas the network is typically made of people.
Both of these ideas--a duality of product and network, and the positive benefits of a larger network--w ould eventually make its way into the age of computers and software.

The Billion Users Club
Many decades after Vail's pronouncement about the network effect, innovation shifted from telephones into software. In this decade, software is eating the world, and its impact is measured in the billions.
The world's leading social network has over 2 billion daily active users. Consumers watch more than a billion minutes per day of video uploaded by millions of individual creators, businesses, and media properties. Our professional workforce, whether based in shiny downtown skyscrapers or out of noisy coffee shops, runs software to collaborate and share documents and files, all built on a multi-hundred-b illion- dollar cloud software industry. The largest hotel chain in the world-- facilitating over 100 million stays per year, generating billions in bookings per year--doesn't own any hotels at all. Instead, they've built a vast network of individuals who list their homes, and attract travelers who are looking for a place to stay. All of this is powered by apps built by developers who've published millions of apps running on 2 billion smartphones across the world, used by people living in remote villages or the world's urban centers.
These are among the world's most powerful technology companies, and they are united by the technology industry's most powerful market force: the network effect.
Network effects are embedded into many of the most ubiquitous and successful tech products around us, in different variations. Products like eBay, OpenTable, Uber, and Airbnb are examples of marketplace networks, comprising buyers and sellers. Dropbox, Slack, and Google

THE COLD START PROBLEM

Suite are workplace collaboration products built from the network of your teammates and coworkers. Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, and Twitter are networks of content creators and consumers (and advertisers!). Developer ecosystems like Android and iOS make it possible for consumers to discover and pay for apps, and the developers that build them.
In fact, just take a look at the companies that have made it into the "Billion Users Club." Apple has 1.6B iOS devices, while Google has 3B. Facebook has 2.85B users across their social network and messaging apps. Microsoft has over 1.5B devices running Windows, and another 1B running Office. In the Chinese technology ecosystem, the companies behind WeChat, TikTok, and AliPay all enjoy ecosystems numbering a billion users each. These are the tiny number of technology products that have reached incredible scale, and perhaps unsurprisingly, almost all of them leverage a network effect.
These are all very diverse products, with different value propositions, target customers, and business models, and yet they all share a common DNA--they have network effects so that their products become useful as more people use them. Just as telegraphs and telephones eventually connected billions of people around the world, so too do these products--to buy and sell, to work together, to communicate, and more.
When software connects people in this way, the network effect can be defined by breaking the term into its constituent parts--the "network" and the "effect."
The "network" is defined by people who use the product to interact with each other. For AT&T's telephone network, it literally consisted of the wiring that spanned between homes. In the digital age, for YouTube, the network is defined by software. It is the content uploaded by creators and the viewers that watch them--a nd the software platform sits in the middle, making recommendations, organizing the video with tags, recommendations, and feeds--so that the right videos are shown to the right consumers. We love using networks when the right people are on them, whether that means marketplace sellers who list the

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 22

9/28/21 4:42 PM

W H AT ' S A N E T W O R K E F F E C T, A N Y WAY ?

23

right products and services, app developers who are building our favorite games, or our favorite celebrities, writers, and friends. In turn, they participate in the network because we and millions of other consumers are on them. It's circular, because after all, they need an audience and a customer base, too.
These networks are counterintuitive in that they connect people, but don't own the underlying assets. Airbnb doesn't own its rooms, and the hosts are free to list their inventory on other networks--the value is connecting the guests with their hosts. Apple doesn't own the developers that publish apps to its app store. And YouTube doesn't own its creators, nor its videos. Although the networks don't own their underlying resources, it's the connection that matters. The entire ecosystem stays on because the value is in bringing everyone together. That's the magic.
The "effect" part of the network effect describes how value increases as more people start using the product. Sometimes the increasing value manifests as higher engagement, or faster growth. But another way is to think about it as a contrast--at its beginning, YouTube didn't have any videos, and neither viewers nor creators would find it valuable. But today, YouTube has nearly 2 billion active users watching a billion minutes of video per day, and this in turn creates engagement between creators and viewers, viewers and each other, and so on. People stay on the network and use it more, because other people are also using it more.
Given these definitions, how do you tell if a product has a network effect, and, if yes, how strong is it? The questions to ask are simple: First, does the product have a network? Does it connect people with each other, whether for commerce, collaboration, communication, or something else at the core of the experience? And second, does the ability to attract new users, or to become stickier, or to monetize, become even stronger as its network grows larger? Does the user face a Cold Start Problem where retention is low when there's no other users? Note that the answers to these questions aren't binary--g enerally not yes or

THE COLD START PROBLEM

no--b ut rather in shades of gray. And that's what makes network effects so much fun to study.
These are important forces. Network effects are key to some of the largest technology companies on the planet, which are in turn becoming the most valuable and important companies overall. You may see this list of "billion user" technology companies and find them aspirational-- perhaps you're an entrepreneur who wants to build the next great startup, propelled and defended by network effects. Or perhaps you are part of the ecosystem of one of these giants, and need to better understand their motivations and strategy. Or maybe you are part of a larger, established player that is looking to compete in a sector defined by network effects. Whatever your motivation, it's critical to understand the underlying dynamics of these products--h ow they launch, how they grow and scale, and how they compete.
For companies that don't strive to understand these powerful dynamics, cautionary tales abound. I'll lay out, later in the book, how Instagram outcompeted an entire generation of photo startups that preceded it. Or how enterprise software--h istorically a sales-led, relationship- driven category--has been reinvented by new products using network effects to drive adoption within the workplace, whether that's WebEx versus Zoom, or Google Suite versus Office. As the technology industry grows, the power of network effects grows with it.

Launching New Tech Products Today Is Incredibly Challenging
At the same time as these tech giants have used the network effect to propel themselves into the stratosphere, it's not a great time to launch a new product. The technology ecosystem is downright hostile to new products--c ompetition is fierce, copycats abound, and marketing channels are ineffective.
Given that, teams launching new products must consider the advan-

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 24

25

tages of new networked products and master the knowledge and skill set to build and launch them. The mechanics of network effects provide a path for new products to break through, as they are often able to attract new users by word of mouth and viral growth, as well as increase engagement and decrease churn as the breadth and density of the network grows. When these types of services succeed, it is difficult for larger and more established companies to catch up. These techniques are evergreen, and especially critical during a time when the environment for new products is difficult. Why is it so difficult? We are now in a zero-sum era of attention with minimal defensibility for a vast swath of mobile apps, software-as-a-service (SaaS) products, and web platforms.
Recall that in 2008, iPhone apps platform launched with only 500 apps, and the ecosystem was wide open for entrepreneurial new startups. The home screen for phones came nearly empty--beckoning new users to install games, productivity tools, and photo-s haring apps. (And flashlight apps, and fart apps!) Developers had easy competition--they just needed to build experiences that are more interesting than activities like waiting in line or taking the subway, or more compelling than tedious meetings at work.
A decade later, this is no longer true. Starting with a few hundred apps at its start, the App Store now has several million apps, all competing for consumer attention. As a result, app developers are locked in furious competition. It's not enough to be a good, useful app--they have to actively take away attention from other hyperaddictive apps that have been optimized over years to engage users. It's a zero-sum game between the millions of apps in the Apple App Store and Google Play store. No wonder the top app charts now rarely change, and are mostly dominated by large, established products.
It's puzzling, because new startups have many advantages going for them compared to in years past, at least in the construction of software. Today, there's an ever-growing community building open source software that can be used instead of building or buying proprietary software, which was the norm a decade ago. Teams can utilize one of the

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 25

9/28/21 4:42 PM

26

THE COLD START PROBLEM

new cloud platforms, like AWS or Azure, instead of operating their own data center. There's accountable, pay-per-c lick advertising to attract new users instead of spending unaccountably on traditional channels, like TV ads. There is off-the-s helf SaaS tooling, as an alternative to building substantial amounts of in-h ouse tooling. There are app stores for efficient global distribution, allowing access to literally billions of new users. This all sounds great, but they are great for you as well as your competition. Most products these days are low technical risk--m eaning they won't fail because the teams can't execute on the engineering side to build the products--but they are generally also low defensibility. When something works, others can follow--and fast.
Although software has been easier to build, growing products has not gotten easier. Networked products also have strong advantages in attracting new users, by leveraging their users to refer other users--this is critical as the channels to market to potential audiences have become highly competitive. Returning to the initial launch of smartphones, when there were fewer apps and app developers, marketing channels like mobile ads and referral programs were effective and affordable. Modern advertising platforms like Google and Facebook are auction based, and companies bid against each other for access to the same target customers. Thus, the fewer competitors the better, but predictably, this did not last. As apps learned to monetize effectively, and venture capital funding poured into the system, the advertising auctions grew more competitive. The channels that previously performed are now expensive, and as they mature and consumers acclimate to them, they click fewer ads and drive down response rates.
Network effects are one of the only protective barriers in an industry where competition is fierce, and defensive barriers are weak. While Instag ram might be able to copy Snapchat's features like Stories or ephemeral photo messages in a few months, it's difficult to change the behavior of millions of consumers to switch over. Larger competitors are often able to copy the product, but find it difficult to capture the network. The engineering effort needed to create software is now rela-

27

tively well understood, and furthermore, there is often an emphasis on simplicity, which can limit complexity and therefore cost.
These dynamics started in the consumer startup sector--w ithin marketplaces, communication, social networks, where network effects have always clearly been important--b ut have infiltrated the software we use in the workplace as well. Knowledge workers increasingly have the same "it just works" expectations on enterprise software, as they do with the apps they use at home. Increasingly, this means the enterprise is becoming "consumerized" with software that is adopted by individuals, then spread within the company's network--with network effects. I'll talk later about Zoom, Slack, Dropbox, and other pioneers in this space, many of which have resulted in business outcomes into the many billions of dollars, as large as any consumer startup's valuation.
All of the above reasons--c onstrained attention from users, intense competition, limited marketing channels to access new users, network- based competitors, and unclear future application platforms--create intense pressure on the industry. There's a lot on the line. When a new product leverages a network effect to build an ecosystem around it, adjacent industries can be disrupted quickly. As technology reinvents industry after industry, the overall opportunity continues to get bigger. Technology will only get more ingrained in our daily lives. The intersection of these two pressures--one from competition, and the other from the immense market opportunity--makes it even more critical for us to get smarter about the impact of network effects in the technology sector.
I've talked about AT&T and the notion of network effects in telephones from 1908, and their importance today, but there's a missing piece that will help formalize our understanding: the dot-c om boom of the late 1990s. While network effects were recognized as early as the turn of the century, our modern conception of it stems from the work done a few decades ago, at the start of the internet age.

A BRIEF HISTORY

The Dot-Com Boom
In 1995, at the dawn of the web, as millions of consumers began to experience the internet for the first time in all its dial-up glory, the world's first commercial websites began to emerge. These websites were built by startups and not just academic researchers, and they ushered in an age of technology-d riven prosperity. Starting in 1995, the Nasdaq rose 400 percent, with dozens of startup IPOs within a few short years: Yahoo. Netscape. eBay. Amazon. Priceline. Today, many of these companies are still around, and worth billions.
In 1996, with the dot-com boom in full swing, just 20 million users had access to the internet, mostly via dial-u p modems. When Theodore Vail had the insight in the early 1900s that the value of networks lay in the number of connections, the entire American Telegraph & Telephone Company network consisted of merely a few million telephones. Today, the size of networks is measured in the billions.
Even with these early, small numbers, there was tremendous excitement about the potential business value of these startups. A new gen eration of dot-com jargon proliferated, including terms like: "Winner- take-a ll." "First mover advantage." "Hockey stick curve." The theory was, if a startup became the first and biggest network--whether for connecting

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 29

THE COLD START PROBLEM

buyers and sellers, or users to content--it would become (theoretically) unstoppable. It would provide more value to its users, buy out its competitors, and otherwise dominate its industry, just as AT&T had done a century ago. No wonder, at its peak, AOL was valued at over $224 billion and was one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Of course, we look back and it all seems a little silly. That's why sometimes the "dot-c om boom" is regularly called the "dot-com bubble"-- many unwell startups IPO'd prematurely based on these ideas, then failed a few years later when funding dried up.
Yet the ideas that dominated dot-com thinking still exist. The tech industry still talks about winner-take-all markets and first mover advantages, when in practice, these are myths and in practical terms have been disproven. Look at the reality: there are weak advantages to being first, since the winning startup is usually a later entrant. And the winner usually doesn't take all, and instead has to battle a number of other networked products over control of different geographies and customer segments. So why the unbridled enthusiasm about network effects? Dig into the literature, and you'll see that one key theory popularized in the dot-c om era presents an unabashed, but highly flawed view of network effects. That theory is Metcalfe's Law.

Metcalfe's Law
If you read the existing literature, it would only take a moment for Metcalfe's Law to come up as a core pillar in the study of network effects--it was popularized in the dot-c om boom and used to justify the enormous valuations of startups at the time. Unlike Vail's quote, it offers a quantitative (albeit simple) explanation of the value of a network as more nodes join it. The law is defined below:
The systemic value of compatibly communicating devices grows as a square of their number3

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 30

9/28/21 4:42 PM

A BRIEF HISTORY

31

Said plainly, each time a user joins an app with a network behind it, the value of the app is increased to n^2. That means if a network has 100 nodes and then doubles to 200, its value more than doubles--it quadruples.
Originally formulated in the 1980s by Robert Metcalfe, an early computer networking pioneer, this theory defines the value of a network as a mathematical function based on the number of connected devices (fax machines, telephones, etc.). It was originally derived from Metcalfe's experiences selling Ethernet, a pre-internet computer networking protocol.
In the late 1990s, it became popular to invoke Metcalfe's Law in the context of the new internet "dot-com" companies popping up in the industry to justify and mark up the valuations of "first movers" in the industry. The business implications of buying into this model of the world were profound. It meant you believed the 1990s dot-c om startups were building the biggest new networks on the planet, and that the value would be exponential. Buy in early, and buy in soon, because the value of these startups would explode.
However, with the benefit of hindsight, it's not clear why Metc alfe's Law ought to apply to building internet websites. It doesn't say much about how to think about, say, buyers and sellers on eBay--a re those users the same as "compatibly communicating devices"? Is eBay as equivalent to a computer networking technology as Bob Metcalfe's original invention, Ethernet? In the excitement of the dot-c om boom, it didn't matter--this "law" was repackaged as the value of a website growing non-linearly as it added users, and became a foundational part of the discussion.

Metcalfe's Flaws
If you stopped reading right here in this book, you would have absorbed nearly all of the high-level strategic thinking that is commonly

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 31

9/28/21 4:42 PM

32

THE COLD START PROBLEM

referenced for network effects. I covered a bit of history, defined a few bits of jargon, threw in a couple of case studies where a big network wallops a small one, a definition for Metcalfe's Law, and some strategic implications. And yet it is not even close to enough for those in the industry who seek to create, scale, and compete using this powerful force. Certainly not for the product managers, engineers, designers, and executives who need to map a strategy around network effects into their upcoming quarterly road maps!
Anyone who's ever actually built a networked product from scratch will tell you that unfortunately, Metcalfe's Law is painfully irrelevant. Although clever for its time, it has not aged well. Metcalfe's Law leaves out important phases of building a network, like what you do right at the beginning when no one is using your product. Nor does it consider the quality of user engagement, and the multi-sidedness of many networks--b uyers and sellers, for example. Nor the difference between "active users" versus just people who have signed up, or the degraded experience of a product as too many users start to overcrowd a network. This is far beyond the simple model of "more nodes is better." Metcalfe's Law is a simple, academic model that fails the test of real-life messiness.

Meerkat's Law
If Metcalfe's Law is broken, what's better? It's one of the central goals of this book to put forth a better theory, and I think I've found one, built on the mathematics of animal populations. It starts with the study of meerkats--yes, you may have seen one, Timon, in the movie The Lion King, along with his friend Pumbaa the warthog.
A better theory for understanding network effects comes from my college years at the University of Washington in Seattle. In my senior year, I took a series of classes about the mathematics underlying

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 32

9/28/21 4:42 PM

A BRIEF HISTORY

33

the study of ecology, in particular those governing the populations of plants and animals. It is the math of social animals--like meerkats, sardines, bees, and penguins--that made me think of the network effect.
There are many types of social animals that benefit by living together--w hether that's from coordinating hunting to finding mates to resisting predators. More nodes in these networks are better. However, if for whatever reason the population of these social animals declines, the benefits can quickly go away, making them more susceptible to collapse. But if the population grows too quickly, and there are too many animals living in too small a space, then overpopulation negates their advantages--which causes the population to plateau. Starting to sound familiar? Yes, it's true: social animals have network effects, too.

The Math of Meerkats
Meerkats are a perfect illustration. They are hypersocial animals living in the southern part of Africa, and when they live together in groups of thirty or fifty animals, they're called "mobs" or "gangs." Meerkats like to hang out in a gang because if one of them sees a predator approaching, they stand up on their two little hind legs and vocalize a complex set of predatory alarm calls to alert the group. They will bark or whistle to indicate if an aerial or terrestrial predator is nearby, and if this predator is low, medium, or high urgency. This helps keep the group safe.
These dynamics were first described in the 1930s by Warder Clyde Allee, a professor at the University of Chicago and a pioneer of American ecology. His paper "Studies in animal aggregations: Mass protection against colloidal silver among goldfishes"4 observed that goldfish grow more rapidly and can resist water toxicity when they are in groups. Just as birds flock together to more easily confuse and resist

ColdStartProb_9780062969743_AS0928_cc20_Final.indd 33

9/28/21 4:42 PM

34

THE COLD START PROBLEM

predators, and mobs of meerkats warn each other of danger, goldfish share the same dynamics. This became an important concept in biology because it was the first to capture the notion that there was a tipping point--c alled an "Allee threshold"--where the animals would be safer and thus ultimately grow faster as a population. In other words, Allee's population curves describe a sort of ecological version of the network effect.

Figure 2: The Allee Threshold
When there are not enough meerkats in a mob to warn each other of danger, it's more likely an individual in the mob will get picked off by a predator. After that, it's a circular dynamic, because with even fewer meerkats, they are even less able to protect themselves, leading to a smaller and smaller population. This is an animal population under the Allee threshold--it tends to go toward zero.
The technology product metaphor here is obvious--if a messaging app doesn't have enough people in it, some users will delete it. And as the user base shrinks, it becomes more likely that each user will leave, ultimately causing inactivity and collapse of the network. This is what

Figure 3: Collapse, if the Allee Threshold isn't met
happened to MySpace as Facebook began to take away its users, or when consumers and app developers moved away from BlackBerry and onto Google or Apple smartphones.
On the other hand, what happens when there's a nice, healthy mob of meerkats? They keep growing, reproducing, and perhaps creating multiple mobs. If you come in above the Allee Threshold, then the population will grow, because they can keep their mob healthy and protected. More meerkats then beget more, and even if predators occasionally pick one or two individuals off, as long as the overall population stays high, it will keep growing.
But that can't last forever, because there's only so many resources-- like the meerkat favorites, bugs and fruit--to support a finite population. As the population increases, eventually there is a natural limit based on the environment--often called a carrying capacity. For social animals like meerkats and goldfish, overpopulation looks like this, starting flat, then hitting a tipping point before growing quickly and then saturating and falling once again:

nication apps, you might start to get too many messages. For social products, there might be too much content in feeds, or for marketplaces, too many listings so that finding the right thing becomes a chore. If you don't apply spam detection, algorithmic feeds, and other ideas, quickly the network becomes unusable. But add the right features to aid discovery, combat spam, and increase relevance within the UI, and you can increase the carrying capacity for users.

When Populations (and Networks) Collapse
When the oceans are overfished, the population of sardines, tunas, and other fish can tip over, collapsing in just a few short years. Technology products with network effects begin the same way--they become a bit less useful when friends leave, but then fully collapse once they dip below the Tipping Point the other way.
The ecological version of this idea can be seen clearly when visiting about an hour south of where I live in San Francisco, where there's a beautiful little town called Monterey, California. The town is famous as much for its abundant fishing as it is for being the hometown of classic American author John Steinbeck. In the early 1900s, when fishing became industrialized, a whole street of sardine canning factories were built, aptly named Cannery Row. The fishing industry of Monterey began to harvest hundreds of thousands of tons of sardines each year. Given it's a small fish, perhaps a few ounces at most, we are talking about something in the order of 5 billion sardines caught per year at the industry's peak.
The industry became a success, supporting a town of tens of thousands of people--until all of a sudden, it stopped. One year in the 1950s, the sardines mysteriously disappeared. The town waited patiently until the next year for the fish to come back--but they didn't. And the year after that, it was the same. And the same again, the year after. The sardines

were gone. In the early years, a sardine catch totaled nearly 800 million tons--just a few decades later, it had collapsed to 17 tons.5
Overfishing, combined with complex animal population dynamics, spelled the end for the Monterey fishing industry. The canneries eventually shut down, and today the old factories serve as a wonderful tourist destination celebrating Steinbeck as well as the study of marine life at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You can still tour the old canneries today, where signs and charts document the rise and fall of the Monterey sardines.
Sardines have network effects, and Allee's curves are useful in thinking about how networks can unwind and collapse. Just as crossing the "Allee threshold" is important for a school of sardines to switch from being low/negative growth into a self-sustaining population, when you harvest the sardines more aggressively, you can push them under the threshold.

Figure 6: Collapsing back past the Allee Threshold
Just as sardines can collapse, so too can the networks of technology products. Why use a texting app that none of your friends are using?

Open an empty app enough times, and you'll quit, too. Pretty soon, the network effects unwind as it speeds toward collapse.

The Allee Curve at Uber
I studied Professor Allee's ideas on mathematical ecology at the University of Washington, but like much of what I learned in college, I promptly forgot them after graduating. Years later, I stood in front of a whiteboard at Uber's headquarters in San Francisco, trying to visualize how adding more drivers to a city would change the experience for riders. The more I thought, and sketched, the more a familiar curve emerged.
When there are very few drivers in a city, it takes a long time to get a ride--this is called having a high ETA (estimated time of arrival). As a result, conversion rates are low, because who has time to wait thirty minutes to get a ride? Thus, until you have a few dozen drivers--let's say fifty for the sake of this example--the value to the user is nearly zero. They won't really use the app, and drivers won't stick around, either, so the entire network will collapse on its own.
Once you pass the Tipping Point, however, things start to work. Riders start getting cars in 15 minutes, and it becomes somewhat inconvenient but still usable. Get it down to 10 minutes or even 5 minutes, then it's even better. The bigger the network of drivers, the more convenient it gets. The rideshare network in a city starts to see the classic network effect!
But eventually, the value of the network plateaus--there's a diminishing return to having more density of drivers. It doesn't matter if you can get 4 minutes versus 2 minutes versus having a driver instantly outside. In fact, it's kind of inconvenient, since you need a little time to get your keys and jump out the door to meet your driver.
Draw this curve out, and it looks something like this:

Meerkat's Law versus Metcalfe's Law
The math of meerkats that governs social animals applies to us, too. After all, humans are social animals, connecting with each other by sharing photos, selling collectible sneakers, sharing work projects, and splitting dinner expenses. Rather than hunting and mating, our networks help us with groceries and dating.
The same underlying dynamics unite groups of us and gangs of meerkats, and there's a lot of ideas to cross-p ollinate between the two species. Just as a social network needs a minimum number of people on it to become engaging, so too does a mob of meerkats. Just as a messaging app will grow and grow but eventually saturate its market, so too does the growth of animals slow down as they begin to overpopulate their environment. While the terms are different, the core concepts and the math are the same:

The Allee effect  The Network Effect Allee Threshold  Tipping Point Carrying capacity  Saturation

In the upcoming chapters, while I use the vocabulary of business-- network effects, Tipping Points, and market saturation--I credit the underlying ideas to Professor Allee and his mathematical models of ecology. Ecologists have created animal population models for centuries to predict how fast they grow, when they become overpopulated, and to predict their complex dynamics. I borrow these same ideas to describe how technology products might launch, scale, and defend their markets with network effects.
These ideas offer a richer theoretical foundation than the usual notion that technology products either have, or don't have, network effects. The tech industry can create a more granular and more precise set of vocabulary, which is needed to get down to the next level of analysis so that concrete concepts and metrics can ultimately be tied to product strategy.
What the industry needs is a unified framework that ties together a set of related concepts and vocabulary. This framework is the heart of The Cold Start Problem.
